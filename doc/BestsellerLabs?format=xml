<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #464646;"><em><strong>Guest post</strong> by Marcy McKay, award-winning copy-writer, novelist, short-story author and freelance journalist.<br />
<span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #ffffff;">-</span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">E</span></span></span><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">very writer has experienced this emotion. When ‘it’ happens, your head explodes, rage swirls through you, while an imaginary fist pounds your gut.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>When? Why?</strong></p>
<p>It so happens that overnight, the internet has been buzzing with the latest literary whiz kid, who hit the New York Times Bestsellers List.<em> </em></p>
<p><em>“It was my first try at a novel,”</em> she chirps.</p>
<p>Your bitterness tastes like bile.  Rage and resentment flood your veins.  That poison you’re feeling is…</p>
<p><strong>Jealousy</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-21175"></span></p>
<p>No matter how the scenario plays out, the end result is the same.  You hate another writer for having what you want: fame, fortune and fabulousness.  All that glory should be yours.</p>
<p>This emotion is so all-consuming that its evil twin – envy, is listed as one of the Seven Deadly Sins.  The desire for others’ traits, status, abilities or situation is such an offense here in the human realm that your punishment is to spend eternity in the freezing waters of Hell.</p>
<p>I didn’t even know that Hell had freezing waters, but I’d rather not find out.</p>
<p><strong>Jealous Much?</strong></p>
<p>Jealousy does not work and play well with others.  There’s no room for abundance.  Only you get to be king of the mountain.</p>
<p>This recent <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/15/my_ugly_inner_battle_how_jealousy_poisoned_my_friendship_with_john_green/" target="_blank">Salon article</a> showcases how one author’s deep envy for John Green on his success with <strong>&#8220;The Fault in Our Stars&#8221;</strong> almost destroyed their friendship.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nathan Rabin admits&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-21192" alt="The Fault in Our Stars" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/The_Fault_in_Our_Stars150.jpg" width="150" height="220" /><em>“I did not like the way it (jealousy) made me feel resentful, petty, insignificant and small. I hated the way it made me feel grubby and desperate, opportunistic and scheming. </em></p>
<p><em>My spirit, if you will, was gracious and happy for John, but my ego, the infernal ego, cried out, “Why not me? Haven’t I paid my dues? Haven’t I written lots of books? Why can’t I be even a fraction that successful?”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Jealousy is a Disease</strong></p>
<p>Get well soon.</p>
<p>Jealousy is hard enough to deal with, but when you rip off its mask, you’ll discover the true culprit is that rat-bastard – fear.  Fear another writer has what you want… fear you won’t get the success you deserve… fear they are stealing what is rightfully yours, even if you’re not putting in the time and energy to make it happen.</p>
<p>Fear has just one job – to stop you from writing.  What better way to avoid getting published than to stew in your own righteous indignation?</p>
<blockquote><p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-21195" alt="The Artists Way" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/artistsway150.jpg" width="150" height="180" />In <strong>&#8220;The Artist’s Way&#8221;</strong>, Julia Cameron says,</p>
<p>“Jealousy is a stingy emotion. It produces tunnel vision.  <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">It narrows our ability to see things in perspective…the biggest lie that jealousy tells us is that we have no choice but to be jealous.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p>This intense emotion holds you hostage.  <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">So paralyzed with rage, you can’t see that taking action is what will save you.  A</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">ction will set you free. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Let Jealousy Be Your Guide</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Jealousy is a map, according to Cameron. If you listen, it will tell you exactly where you need to go.  Let jealousy be your guide.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How to Make A Jealousy Map:</strong></p>
<p>Make three columns:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Column #1</strong> lists WHO you envy.<br />
<strong>Column #2</strong> lists WHY you’re jealous of them – be as specific as you can to best understand your rage.<br />
<strong>Column #3</strong> lists your ACTION to take to free you from jealousy and lead to creative success.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="color: #808080;">Example&#8230;</span></em></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21237" alt="jealousy-map" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/jealousy-map-s.jpg" width="600" height="347" /></strong></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Big Change Starts With Small Steps</strong></p>
<p>In fact, the tinier the action the better, or the creative risk might terrify you and freeze you to the spot (like those freezing waters in Hell).</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I love this quote by Cameron. </span><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">“Green is the color of jealousy, but it’s also the color of hope.” </em><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Use that forceful energy to lead your writing to a better place, because the opportunity for writers has never been greater. </span></p>
<p>You have more choices than ever before.  Traditional publishing, do-it-yourself, or a hybrid combination of both.  Social media provides endless ways to build a platform and create loyal, passionate followers.  <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Blogs such as Bestseller Labs provide writers with the blueprint for success.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Let your green-eyed monster make you insanely successful, rather than just insane.</span></p>
<p><em><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><br />
</span></strong></em><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-21185" alt="macy-and-book2" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/macy-and-book2.jpg" width="250" height="188" /><em><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">This is a guest post by Marcy McKay, who is the Energizer Bunny of Writers</span></strong></em></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">She believes writing is delicious and messy and hard and important. </span></p>

<p><strong>Motivating Video For Writers From Author Jessica Park.  <strong>[2 mins] </strong></strong></p>
<p>After hearing, <em>&#8220;No, it won&#8217;t sell&#8221;</em> 14 times from traditional publishers, Jessica Park began to feel <em>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m not good enough&#8230;&#8221;  </em></p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">So she decided to self-publish her book &#8220;Flat Out Love&#8221; on Amazon&#8217;s KDP. (Kindle Direct Publishing.)   </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">In this brief video, Jessica reveals what happened next.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Be inspired.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&#8216;ve posted this for writer friends who may be needing motivation, or who find themselves adrift on the writing ocean, swept between waves of narcissism and self doubt.</span></p>
<p>The secret of her success in my view is, of course, having a beautifully written book that struck a chord with readers, who have the spread the word.  But there&#8217;s also the factor of blind, obstinate, unstoppable determination in the face of rejection.</p>
<p>Certainly gets my utter, awestruck admiration.</p>
<p>My thanks to Jessica for her permission to run this story and video.  You can find out more about her writing journey on the <a href="http://www.jessicapark.me/self-publishing-thoughts.html" target="_blank">Jessica Park</a> website.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: xx-large;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20896" alt="skydive-header" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/skydive-600Free.jpg" width="600" height="338" /></span><strong><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">H</span></span><span style="font-size: medium;">ave you ever been afraid to &#8220;take the leap&#8221; and write because you&#8217;re assailed by doubt and uncertainty? Well, your Knight In Shining Armor has just arrived.</span></strong></p>
<p>Today’s post is by Bryan Hutchinson, whose mission is to help fellow writers by inspiring them to put aside any uncertainties and be what they truly want to be &#8211;  practicing writers.</p>
<p><span id="more-20864"></span></p>
<p>On his <a href="http://positivewriter.com" target="_blank">Positive Writer</a> blog , Bryan has interviewed Seth Godin, Guy Kawasaki and other luminaries, all of whom overflow with the same empowering positivism.  So stand by to be motivated!    **<em>And do please leave a comment.  Bryan and I would value hearing about any challenges you face in this writing life.</em></p>
<p><em>Over to Bryan&#8230;</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-20904" alt="Bryan Hutchinson" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Bryan_Hutchinson_120.jpg" width="120" height="190" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-large;">&#8220;N</span>o matter what your personal ambitions are as a writer, there will always be play-it-safers who tell you writing is a <em>bad choice</em>, it’s not worth it, there’s no money in it and, well, basically you need to lower your expectations and live down here with the rest of us.</p>
<p>So, stop aiming so high, you’re just going to hurt yourself or hurt someone else when you fail.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: medium; line-height: 1.5em;">How many people face such discouragement?</strong></p>
<p>How many people heed the warnings and take the easy, secure route?  <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">How many people allow their dreams to be dismissed because they take advice from people who are not willing to follow and live their own dreams?</span></p>
<p>We’ve all had people tell us to lower our expectations and fall in line. Maybe it wasn’t with those exact words, but you know what I mean and you know who I am talking about.</p>
<p>I’ve received the same type of messages. I’ve been asked countless times why I write so many blog posts and publish books since I’m (apparently) not making any money at it.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-18252" alt="writing a book" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/writing2.jpg" width="200" height="118" />I’m never asked by the play-it-safers if I’m having any success blogging and publishing books. No, possibly because they are afraid to ask – afraid to find out that following your dream can be a rewarding endeavor.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The point is that everyone has an assumption about what you should or shouldn’t be doing based on their version of the world and how things should and shouldn’t work.</span></p>
<p>And since they don’t believe in themselves they also won’t allow themselves to believe you can do any better. In fact, they may try to stop you. Don’t let them.</p>
<blockquote><p>We don&#8217;t see the world as it is, we see it as we are”<br />
<em>― Anaïs Nin</em></p></blockquote>
<p>However, the flipside of that is there are people who DO believe in themselves and will do everything in their power to convince you that you should believe in yourself, too.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise why one of the above two types of people tend to become mentors and the other type of person doesn’t (at least, let’s hope not).</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2598" alt="Walt Disney" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/waltdisney.jpg" width="90" height="114" /></p>
<p>Walt Disney’s editor at the Kansas City Star Newspaper in 1919 fired Disney and told him he lacked imagination and had no good ideas.</p>
<p>What if Disney had believed him and went on to do something more realistic and down-to-earth with his life? If so, would we have ever heard of Walt Disney?</p>
<h3>5 Things Play-It-Safers Say To Talk You Out Of Your Dreams:</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>1 – You’re not lucky enough</strong></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20917" alt="Luck" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/lucky200.jpg" width="200" height="150" />The reality is that you make your own luck by putting yourself in the position for opportunity to strike. Play-it-safers never get “lucky” because they never position themselves for opportunities.</p>
<p>If you never write and publish a book then you never have to worry about it not selling, much less about it becoming a bestseller. However, if you do write and publish a book you position yourself for opportunity, and to write and publish more books. Your bestseller might not be your first book, it might be your second or third.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">2 – You don’t know the right people</span></strong></p>
<p>The play-it-safers will never know the right people because they don’t get out there to do the work and network. If you’re putting yourself in the position for opportunity to strike, then you’re also putting yourself in position to network with the “right” people.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>3 – What if it doesn’t work out?</strong></span></p>
<p>Play-it-safers will always try to make you think of the worst case scenario because that’s what they focus on. The worst case scenario usually means you end up right back where you are right now.</p>
<p>Wow – you’re going to let that stop you? I didn’t think so. The worst case scenario is never as bad as someone else imagines it for you.</p>
<blockquote><p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20879" alt="Mark Twain" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/twain-s.jpg" width="90" height="118" />&#8220;I am an old man and have known a great many troubles.  I have been through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><em>- Mark Twain</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">4 – You will fai</span>l</strong></p>
<p>The one thing you’ll notice from the vast majority who try to talk you out of something is that they speak in absolutes.</p>
<p>You will fail. Really? How do they know that? People who never take any risks of their own cannot see the upside of trying something challenging. No one’s ever accomplished something worthwhile that didn’t hold the risk of, “It might not work.”</p>
<p>And so what if you do fail? Failure isn’t a bad thing, especially when you learn valuable lessons you would not have learned otherwise.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">5 – It’s hard work</span></strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20920" alt="Thumbs Up" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/thumbs-up120.jpg" width="120" height="171" /></p>
<p>Of course following your dream is hard work, but that’s not a bad thing or something to avoid. Thanks to TV and Radio we hear about overnight success stories all the time, but the truth is by the time you see someone new on TV, or hear a new artist sing on the radio, they’ve already been paying their dues working behind the scenes on their crafts for years.</p>
<p>It’s always going to be hard work, and that’s okay.</p>
<p>Remember the other type of people I mentioned who do believe in themselves and will do everything in their power to convince you that you should believe in yourself, too?</p>
<p>Find such a person, ask him or her to coach you, to be your mentor, and get ready to roll up your sleeves. For those who follow their dreams, hard work is just another way that demonstrates it’s worth it.</p>
<h3>Don’t be a play-it-safer</h3>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Don’t let anyone talk you out of your dream simply because they can’t see or even imagine what <em>you </em>can see and imagine.  </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">F</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">or you the sky is not the limit, but the naysayers and play-it-safers reached their limit of<em> mediocrity</em> long ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Let the play-it-safers, play it safe.   </span><strong>But not you!<br />

<p><em></em><span style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: xx-large;">D</span><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">id you know there’s only one (count it: one!) reason readers read?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">This reason manifests in many different ways. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">One reader might call it a search for knowledge. Another might call it a desire to be swept away to unfamiliar worlds. Others might say they&#8217;re after adrenaline or maybe romance. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">But what those reasons all boil down to is: <strong>curiosity</strong>.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20790" alt="keyhole" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/keyhole-glow-175.jpg" width="175" height="236" /></p>
<p>Readers read because there&#8217;s something in a story that piques their curiosity. There&#8217;s something they don’t know about the characters, the setting, or the plot—and it&#8217;s driving them absolutely crazy!</p>
<p><strong>In other words, the author has a secret.</strong></p>
<p>And if that author is a smart cookie, he&#8217;s going to milk that secret for everything it’s worth.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The longer and greater the readers&#8217; curiosity, the more un-put-down-able your story will be.  </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">So how can you make sure you&#8217;re planting and delivering the kind of secrets that will keep readers up into the wee hours of the morning?</span></p>
<p>In studying masterful classics, such as Charlotte Brontë&#8217;s Jane Eyre (whose process and techniques I analyze in my book <em><a href="http://amzn.com/B00LLOOSWA" target="_blank">Jane Eyre: The Writer’s Digest Annotated Classic</a></em>,) I discovered <span style="text-decoration: underline;">four important steps</span> to make sure your story’s secrets drive your readers wild.</p>
<h3>Step #1: Plan the Secret</h3>
<p>To begin with, you gotta have a secret.</p>
<p>The secret doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to be something major (like a crazy wife in the attic). The only real requirement is that it raises a question your readers will want to answer.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20753" alt="Attic Doors" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/atticdoors175.jpg" width="175" height="233" /></p>
<p>Why doesn&#8217;t Angie want to tell Bill she went to the grocery store? What’s Little Sammy so insistent on hiding under his bed? How come Liz always wears red stilettos?</p>
<p>But remember: the more emphasis you place on the secret&#8217;s importance, the better the payoff will have to be (more on that in Step #3).</p>
<p>Often, secrets arise straight from your character&#8217;s backstory. Perhaps something horrible happened to him—or he committed a horrible crime against someone else. Now it&#8217;s haunting him. But, more important, it’s motivating him.</p>
<p>Secrets can’t be random. They must always inform your plot. If your hero’s mom dying when he was twelve has zero bearing on your story of nuclear war, then don’t shroud it in tantalizing darkness for two-thirds of the story.</p>
<h3>Step #2: Plant the Secret</h3>
<p>Successfully planting a secret is all about foreshadowing. If readers are going to be curious about something dark in your character&#8217;s past, they first have know about that something dark. You can accomplish this in several ways.</p>
<p><strong>Tone</strong></p>
<p>Never underestimate the power of narrative tone in letting readers know something&#8217;s under your story’s surface.</p>
<p>Jane Eyre is the Gothic novel in large part due to Brontë&#8217;s pitch perfect use of tone.</p>
<p>When Jane takes that nannying job at Rochester&#8217;s gloomy mansion, she has no reason to view Thornfield Manor as anything except a sanctuary. And yet through such subtle tricks as shadowy lighting, unspoken menace, and carefully chosen verbiage, Brontë lets her readers know right from the beginning that something dark is afoot.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20727" alt="Bars" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/bars-175.jpg" width="175" height="263" />Symbolism</strong></p>
<p>Symbolism works hand in hand with tone to create a subtle—sometimes even unconscious—sense of weight within a novel. It creates what Ernest Hemingway called &#8220;the 9/10ths of the iceberg under the water.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Jane Eyre, Brontë uses cages and prisons to symbolize Thornfield, which provides a remarkable contrast with her protagonist&#8217;s initial view of her new job as a harbinger of freedom and hope. The juxtaposition jars readers and prepares them for more specific revelations yet to come.</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>Show, don’t tell—that favorite aphorism of writers everywhere—comes into play here as well. When Angie keeps hiding her grocery receipts from Bill, and Little Sammy keeps shoving something under the bed, and Liz keeps doing laundry in those stilettos, you know readers are going to start wondering what’s going on.</p>
<p>You don’t have to tell them something is amiss when they can read the signs for themselves. When everybody at Thornfield keeps dodging Jane&#8217;s curiosity about the strange happenings in the attic, well, who wouldn&#8217;t want to find out what&#8217;s going on?</p>
<p><strong>Direct Statements</strong></p>
<p>As powerful as subtlety can be when properly wielded, don’t feel you can’t come right out and tell readers there&#8217;s a secret.</p>
<p>Allowing one character to acknowledge to another that something&#8217;s up with Little Sammy confirms readers&#8217; suspicions and guides their curiosity into a more specific question. When Jane outright asks about the mysterious goings-on upstairs—and nobody will tell her anything—readers&#8217; curiosity is jacked that much higher.</p>
<h3>Step #3: Confront the Secret</h3>
<p>As your story progresses, you will need to sow new clues throughout. Little by little, you have to feed readers new information, both to remind them of their curiosity and to whet their appetites for the big reveal.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20758" alt="Magnifying Glass" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/magglass3-175.jpg" width="210" height="168" /></p>
<p>This is where those direct statements become important. At some point in every story, your characters need to get down and dirty about that secret. They need to confront each other, demand answers, and gain perhaps a speck or two or truth—but, just as importantly, more than few <em>misdirections</em> as well.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The more effective your secret, the longer it will take your readers to solve the mystery.</span></p>
<p>But readers are smart. Give them enough time to consider the clues, and they’ll probably out-Sherlock your protagonist. You can’t pretend away the obvious clues. You have to face them head on and—without lying to your readers—get them to believe those clues mean nothing.</p>
<p>One of the most masterful scenes in Jane Eyre has Jane finally venting her frustrated curiosity and demanding answers about the crazy person living in the attic. Jane voices all the suspicions readers are pondering—only to have those suspicions neatly dealt with.</p>
<p>Just like that, curiosity is raised to a higher pitch, even as it is deflected away from the truth.</p>
<h3>Step #4: Pay Off the Secret</h3>
<p><strong>What’s the good of a secret if you can’t eventually tell it, right? </strong></p>
<p>When and how you pay off your story&#8217;s secret will depend on the secret&#8217;’s importance to the plot.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20763" alt="Mad eyes" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mad-eye-175.jpg" width="175" height="142" />When your secret is a story-changer (as is the revelation of Rochester&#8217;s mad wife on the day of his marriage to Jane), the timing has to be perfectly planned. What is the latest possible moment in your story in which you can reveal the answer? What moment will be most devastating to the characters and create the most interesting repercussions?</p>
<p>Most important of all, the secret&#8217;s pay-off must be brilliant.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve tantalized readers with the possibilities for 300 pages, only to reveal Angie was just trying to keep Bill from seeing his birthday present, readers are sure to feel gypped.</p>
<p><strong>Great plot twists are based on overwhelming, shocking, scandalizing, story-shaking secrets.</strong></p>
<p>If you can build a powerful secret into the heart of your story, and then pay it off in a way that stuns readers, you can be sure they&#8217;’ll be on Amazon buying your next book all of thirty seconds after finishing this one.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="font-size: x-large;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20612" alt="header-books" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/header-books-inferno.jpg" width="600" height="400" />T</span><strong>here are many powerful ways to significantly improve your chances of building a large book readership.  </strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">To help determine the likelihood of you succeeding, </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I’ve put together ten key questions for you to think about when starting a new writing project.   </span></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Prepare to be &#8220;caught in the headlights&#8221; by these questions &#8211; they&#8217;re designed to expose the reality of being an author, but also to give a useful insight into your career pathway.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">In truth, this is not a <em>definitive</em> list, but I&#8217;ve found these particular questions to be helpful guidance in my own work.  Let me know in the comments which of these is relevant to you &#8211; I&#8217;d value the feedback.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span id="more-20588"></span></span></span></p>
<h3>1. Do you employ the potency of your TRUE self?</h3>
<p>The most effective way to attract a large and committed readership is to develop your own unique &#8220;Writer’s Voice&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12734" alt="Viral Word of Mouth" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/boygirlbook-s.jpg" width="200" height="133" /></p>
<p>T<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">his requires reaching into your deepest emotional wells, and writing about what you genuinely love &#8211; the things you obsess over.  </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">You need to invoke the potent uniqueness of </span><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">you</em><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">.</span></p>
<p>A unique voice gives you control of a market, because committed reader fans can only ever buy this particular magic from you.  You alone.  Think about the gravity of this.</p>
<p>More about the power of <a href="http://bestsellerlabs.com/the-key-to-growing-readership/ ">“Writer’s Voice”</a> here.</p>
<h3>2. Are you writing for a particular genre because it’s popular?</h3>
<p>Do you write for a particular genre because you believe there’s money in it? That is a sure fire recipe for ending up in nowhere land.  Fortunately there’s a better pathway to your <em>publishing Nirvana</em>.</p>
<p>To quote <a href="http://bestsellerlabs.com/game-of-thrones-editor-reveals-top-writing-tips/"><em>Game Of Thrones</em> editor Jane Johnson</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6158" alt="Jane Johnson" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/janeshad.jpg" width="110" height="170" />“Write with a fire in your heart… There may be all sorts of received wisdom out there about ‘what agents are looking for’ or ‘what publishers want’ or ‘what’s selling’ but who wants a second-rate copy of someone else’s idea?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Write something unique to you and it will stand out from the crowd. Otherwise it’ll be second rate copy of someone else’s work.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Jane Johnson</em></p>
<h3>3. Do you stick to a schedule? (Be honest.)</h3>
<p>When asked for the secret of writing, Irish novelist Maeve Binchy pointed out that in life there are many secrets, such as the secret to having a svelte, flawless body.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20627" alt="Calendar" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/calendar2.jpg" width="238" height="249" />Unfortunately that particular secret turns out to require endless hours of exercise, dieting, cleansing and nourishing – otherwise known as </span><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">work</em><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">.</span></p>
<p>Her <a href="http://bestsellerlabs.com/maeve-binchy-her-writing-secrets-interview/">&#8220;Secret to Writing&#8221;</a> is not dissimilar.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Set yourself down and do not stand up until you have 5 pages written, and then do that again another day of the week, and if you do 10 pages a week, by year&#8217;s end you’ll have 520 pages… a novel.&#8221;   </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Maeve Binchy</em></p>
<h3>4. Are you afraid of being judged?</h3>
<p>Have you suffered one of those moments when you completely freeze up and cannot write&#8230; AT ALL?</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20630" alt="fear-of-judgement" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fear-of-judgement2.jpg" width="238" height="204" /></p>
<p>The most common cause is the fear of being judged.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;What on earth will people think of my book?&#8221;</em> you lament, secretly.  You are not alone.  Hemingway suffered from this to an extreme degree with the huge weight of expectations weighing him down.</p>
<p>How to escape this?  My <a href="http://bestsellerlabs.com/how-to-beat-writers-block-forever/ ">blog post on Writer’s Block</a> shows you how to break free of this syndrome and write freely and creatively.</p>
<h3>5. Do you edit as you write?</h3>
<p>The truth is that writers often edit as they go as a form of procrastination.  (This may be you!)</p>
<p>The bottom line is that editing on the fly will in most cases chloroform creative flow and generate dull writing.  Instead it’s best to slam down all your ideas, with or without a plan, then go back and do the road mending and altering later.</p>
<p>Just get that crap out there!</p>
<h3><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20633" alt="Editors" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/editors.jpg" width="238" height="171" />6. Do you use a professional editor?</h3>
<p>There’s no other way of saying it:</p>
<p>Typos, verbosity, rodomontade, grandiosity and plain old bad syntax will throw a reader out of the narrative in an instant.</p>
<p>Editors are Gods.<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Do employ a good editor. </span></p>
<h3>7. Do you write for a specific, easily identifiable genre?</h3>
<p>e.g. &#8220;Romantic Suspense&#8221;, &#8220;Police Procedural&#8221; &#8220;Mystery Thriller&#8221;, &#8220;Historical Romance.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no question that it’s crucial to write in a way that comes the most easily and naturally to you.  The writing can then flow and produce the magic you seek.</p>
<p>But it’s also true that when a book is written in a clearly identifiable genre it will increase its chances of being discovered by book buyers.</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting that you shoehorn your writing into a genre just so it will be found. Instead it’s a case of being able to clearly identify exactly what it is you’re writing when describing it in the marketplace.</p>
<h3>8. Are you hoping for a bestseller with your first book?</h3>
<p>The reality is that a single book has a very low chance of &#8220;breaking out&#8221;.</p>
<p>By contrast a whole line of books will sell each other, and develop the author’s reputation. It also pays to be aware that a <em>series</em> will generally do even better than simply a collection of novels.  e.g. Harry Potter, Game of Thrones,  A Series Of Unfortunate Events.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-697 aligncenter" alt="Series Of Unfortunate Events" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/seriesunfortunate-s1.jpg" width="500" height="249" /></p>
<p>More on the power of series <a href="http://bestsellerlabs.com/the-hottest-tip-no-fiction-writer-can-afford-to-ignore/">in this post:  &#8220;Series&#8221;</a></p>
<h3>9. Are you planning to just write and leave everything else to a publisher?</h3>
<p>Your job is to write, theirs is to publish and promote. Correct?</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-14579" alt="Publishing Contract" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/contract.jpg" width="190" height="126" />I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings. But while that may have been the case, to a certain extent, up to about 30 years ago, publishers now rarely promote books by new authors.</p>
<p>Traditional publishers will only spend money promoting brand name authors such as Nora Roberts or George R.R. Martin, because their large fan bases make them a safe bet.</p>
<p>But if you’re a new author, no such luck, except in rare instances. Even if you do have a publisher it’s still largely down to you to market your own books.</p>
<p>Here are <a href="http://bestsellerlabs.com/7-bestseller-strategies-for-writers/">seven key marketing strategies</a> that will help you to do this successfully.</p>
<h3>10. Do you know WHY you are writing?</h3>
<p>Get clear why you are doing this.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt you’d like to earn some money from your work, but essentially it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">vocational</span>.</p>
<p>Being a writer embodies more than putting words on paper.  It reaches deep within.  It’s who you ARE.  Furthermore, most writers are not aware of the extraordinarily powerful advantage they have:</p>
<p>IDENTITY:  “I am a writer.”</p>
<p>Very few people on earth know who they are, or what their purpose is.</p>
<p>But you do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20570" alt="Casablanca" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/casablanca-titled.jpg" width="600" height="465" /><span style="font-size: x-large;">I</span><strong>n another life, nearly 20 years ago, I was fortunate to attend a sensational seminar, the famous Robert McKee 3 day &#8220;STORY BOOTCAMP&#8221;. </strong></p>
<p>In fact, <i>sensational</i> is an understatement.  My stand-out memory is McKee, wreathed in cigarette smoke, leaping about and ranting about how crucial it is to employ the power of ALL the human senses in writing, whether in movies or literature.</p>
<p>Fragrance, sound, touch, pain&#8230; the tang of salt air, roaring gales, the burning heat of fire, the chill of frost on window panes and so on.</p>
<p>But his most vivid example was from the 1942 movie &#8220;Casablanca&#8221;.</p>
<p><span id="more-20492"></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20507" alt="Casablanca Poster" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/casablanca180.jpg" width="147" height="261" /></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Basically a group of refugees were trapped there, waiting to escape by plane.  It was almost a prison in a way, so the director cast powerful, subliminal &#8220;prison bars&#8221; lighting in almost every scene to enhance the claustrophobic sensation of imprisonment.  </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Look closely:  Shadows of prison window bars across actors Paul Henreid and Ingrid Bergman can be seen in the screen shot above.</span></p>
<p>The McKee magic came rushing back to me this week when I was offered a guest post by author Claudette Young.  She has explored this very same subject, the power of lighting in our work.</p>
<p>The article is such a gift, I could hardly wait to publish it.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p><em>Over to Claudette&#8230;</em></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-16761 alignleft" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="Claudette Young" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Claudette.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p><em>Claudette Young has written about <em>craft for Wordsmith Studio and other venues, and has been through the &#8216;author mill&#8217;.  Based on her experiences she&#8217;s offered to share her discoveries about the sensory power of lighting up your writing</em><em><em>. </em></em></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="font-size: xx-large;">&#8220;A</span><strong>nyone can write a story, but not everyone illuminates with their words. And learning to emphasize without red flags, spotlights, or extraneous punctuation is a skill worth the effort</strong>.</span></p>
<p>Tell you what&#8230;  close your eyes and visualize the room you occupy.</p>
<p>Where is the light coming from? A lamp? A window? A door with glass inserts? Ask yourself how you would begin a story with the scene behind your eyelids.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Effective writing uses lighting elements within the storyline as much or more than any other descriptive. A story arc always has a setting and characters. A setting can also act as one of the primary characters. One of its lesser considered unique physical traits is lighting, and the writer is also the </span><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">lighting director</em><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20525" alt="Hawaii" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hawaii600.jpg" width="600" height="337" /><strong>Think about these classics:</strong></p>
<p>Michener’s “Hawaii” or Frank Herbert’s “Dune.” Margaret Mitchell used master strokes in “Gone with the Wind.”</p>
<p>The trick of illuminating writing is to accentuate the setting’s or character’s features. Any character can switch on a lamp to light a room. It’s the writer who doesn’t always use a “written” switch for the lamp who garners great writing credit scores.</p>
<p>I’ll bet you’ve seen some of the best examples around.</p>
<h3>Light Informs the Mind</h3>
<p>TV and movies require the criticality of lighting. One of the elemental differences between the three CSI series begins in the first instant of viewing. Each of the franchise’s series has specific lighting.</p>
<p><strong>1. CSI Las Vegas:</strong> subdued lighting in lab scenes to highlight instruments and individual work stations. The mood—a cave-like space hidden from view or protected from the searing desert sun.</p>
<p>Interior crime scenes: done with a flashlight to add a more sinister element or suspense. Exterior, daytime scenes: muted, almost dusty, light inherent to the desert during early morning or late afternoon. Exterior night scenes: reflect glittering lights of locale.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20531" alt="Vegas400" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/csi-vegas400.jpg" width="400" height="225" /></p>
<p><strong>2. CSI Miami:</strong> created much different mood and viewer expectation. Lighting: vibrant and harsh&#8211;primary colors in blatant HD. Most episodes filmed with sun-filled exterior scenes.</p>
<p>Interior labs explode with light from expansive windows and slick surfaces that reflect light, and Horatio Cain goes nowhere without his sunglasses (the viewer might wonder what he’s really hiding behind those Foster Grants.)</p>
<p>Filming technique used exaggerates natural light to create visual clarity not found in the other two series.  Focus accentuates youth and physical beauty along with modern architecture, glistening in the sunshine.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20532" alt="Miami400" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/csi-miami400.jpg" width="400" height="218" /></p>
<p><strong>3. CSI NY:</strong> viewer taken into the cluttered, gritty streets of New York City—light was flatter, less defined, dimmer. Skyscrapers kept sunlight at bay. Because of setting, exterior shots appeared depressing.</p>
<p>The labs: unique for both the building’s architecture type and lighting, though the equipment flaunted high-tech with its own special lighting. The setting screams New York City as the stereotype here. The viewer would never have to hear the name to know the place.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20539" alt="New York 400" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/csi-ny400.jpg" width="400" height="225" /></p>
<h3>Light in Literature</h3>
<p>Let’s face it. The old standard, “It was a dark and stormy night,” became cliché because it was an excellent beginning line. It cued the reader with lighting.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20541" alt="In Cold Blood - Capote" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/incoldblood180.jpg" width="180" height="278" /></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Horror movies mastered lighting to help show the story, create the mood, and modulate suspense. After the opening two minutes of a film, lighting had already left its message and set the reader on a predetermined emotional course.</span></p>
<p>The same power holds true for all writers. Truman Capote introduced creative non-fiction to the mass market with his thriller “In Cold Blood” by working the scenes as any good lighting director would do. It’s a matter of words and their use.</p>
<p>When you experience a scene behind your eyelids, sensations and impressions reveal the story. It automatically shows rather than tells. Stop long enough to think about the last riveting daydream you had.</p>
<h3>Good lighting allows cues for the reader about shifting characters, setting and much more</h3>
<p>Here’s an example of a tiny use of lighting that brings mood into play that foreshadows and hints at backstory. In Mercedes Lackey’s book, “Sacred Ground” she needs to establish a new primary character a couple of chapters into the book without using an info dump.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“He was posed right under one of the porch lights, and she couldn’t help but make mental comparisons with the guy she used to know. The guy she used to know wouldn’t have posed like that, making a macho body-language statement, clearly blocking her way &#8230;”</em></p>
<p>Lackey gives the reader an immediate chance to relate and visualize the scene. She doesn’t have to say that his arms are crossed. She doesn’t have to explain why he’s behaving as he is—at least not until later. The reader knows now that there’s history between the two characters and that it didn’t end pleasantly. The “porch light” haloes this character as important in the future and gives the reader a taste of his personality. It served its purpose well.</p>
<p>One of my favorite authors is the high fantasy writer, David Eddings.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20545" alt="The Seeress Of Kell" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/The-Seeress-Of-Kell.jpg" width="180" height="281" /></p>
<p>Eddings uses large numbers of characters and settings and is a master of intricate story lines. Here is an excerpt from one of his books in series, “The Seeress of Kell.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“The office in Yar Nadrak of Silk and Yarblek’s far-flung commercial empire was in a loft over a cavernous warehouse filled with bales of furs and deep-piled Mallorean carpets. The factor was a squinty-eyed Nadrak named Zelmit, who was probably almost as untrustworthy as he looked…”</em></p>
<p>Here the reader learns about three people and more in the space of two sentences.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Silk and Yarblek are rich, commercial traders<br />
2. Zelmit works for them and has squinty eyes and looks untrustworthy.<br />
3. The office is in a loft over a huge warehouse<br />
4. The warehouse (presumably theirs) is filled with furs and carpets<br />
5. The lighting conditions surrounding the characters</p>
<p>What is lighting like in a crowded warehouse in high fantasy? One can assume that it’s dark or dim at best. The genre connotes medieval conditions. That fact makes it logical to assume few, if any, windows in the office space. Perhaps Zelmit is “squinty-eyed” due to the lighting, perhaps not.</p>
<p>All of the lighting in this scene is inferred, yet the reader fills in the blanks and quickly moves on with an internal image in mind.</p>
<h3>Bringing Things to Light</h3>
<p>Of course, inference can do much of the writer’s work without adding word count. In fact, if the writer uses strong, concrete nouns and verbs, little extraneous description is necessary. Here are some examples of illumination without padding.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1.</strong><em> “Gillian’s surfer good looks drew every eye. Sunrays escaped late afternoon clouds to spotlight her while she selected a champagne flute from a passing waiter. Peacock blue brocade suited her well.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><strong>2.</strong> <em>“Alaska enjoyed a good winter.  Snow rose to meet the roof on the west side.  Iditarod dogs and their owners would arrive in half an hour.  He glanced across the runway.  </em><em>Mary had readied the welcome party for the first load of participants.  He hoped the new racers would appreciate all the work she’d done to make them feel warm and at home.  He’d readied the fireplaces.  She’d worried with candles.  Now, if they could keep the runway’s flame pots burning until the plane landed, everyone would sleep well tonight.”</em></p>
<p>Both of these paragraphs use light in different ways. The first informs the reader that the scene is happening either in late afternoon or at twilight.</p>
<p>The inferred gathering involves champagne indicating a party, probably formal. If Gillian is wearing brocade, it’s possibly chilly in temperature. Brocade is a heavier fabric in the main. Also, Gillian is physically fit with a deep tan since her looks are equated with a surfer.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20548" alt="Alaska" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/alaska.jpg" width="250" height="232" />The second paragraph is set during an Alaskan winter. Heavy snow blankets the area. It’s dark all winter in that state. <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">They are using fireplaces (logical) and candles (also logical,) which means they aren’t using a generator. The flame pots for the runway mean it’s a small private strip.</span></p>
<p>The feel of the place and the characters comes through to the reader.</p>
<h3>Lasting Impressions</h3>
<p>The writer needs to be his own lighting director.</p>
<p>The movie he brings to light is contained between book covers and requires the best illumination possible. Regardless of storyline, characters, or settings the writer who can sprinkle sparkles and shimmers throughout will leave an impression and hold the reader’s attention.</p>
<p>On the story’s last page, the reader isn’t thinking of which writing devices were used. Writers can use blatant or subtle clues spun from bright and dark, dappled and ethereal.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-20579 alignright" alt="Lamp" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/typewriter-lamp1.jpg" width="250" height="166" /></p>
<p>The impression left behind is one about the writer as much as the story.  <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">That <em>light-weaving</em> ability will foster loyalty, and testimonials that gather more avid readers.</span></p>
<p>And that is what the writer wants&#8230; above all.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><span style="font-size: xx-large;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20154" alt="Brandon Flowers - The Killers" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Brandon-Flowers-600.jpg" width="600" height="375" />A</span></span><strong>s a writer, you can almost always sense those moments when the &#8220;writing flame&#8221; is burning brightly, but sometimes the words still refuse to catch fire. </strong></p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">It may be because you&#8217;re not being true to yourself &#8211; at the deepest level.  </span></p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>Recently I’ve been obsessing over a 2008 video, <em>Human</em> by <em>The Killers</em>, because it illuminates a truth that every artist, writer and musician needs to accept.</p>
<p><span id="more-19958"></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Debate has raged over the meaning of the main lyric in the song -</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><em>&#8220;Are you human, or are you dancer?&#8221;  </em></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">But its meaning is perfectly clear:  </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Are you being entirely true to yourself, creating with all the human originality you possess? O</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">r are you afraid to trust your own voice, and are merely an imitator, &#8216;dancing someone else&#8217;s steps&#8217;?<br />
<span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #ffffff;">_</span></span></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RIZdjT1472Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #ffffff;">_</span></p>
<h3><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Are You Writing With Your Own Unique &#8220;Voice&#8221;?  </span></h3>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Seriously, think about it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Are you trusting your potent uniqueness when writing, or are you dazzled by the success of someone else’s work and slavishly copying it, masking your writing with their style and identity?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>One Of The Biggest Creative Killers Is Trying To Be Someone Other Than Yourself As A Writer</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">For example, are you writing about &#8220;vampires&#8221; simply because it&#8217;s a hot book market?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">If you choose that &#8220;copycat&#8221; route, a Tiger called </span><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">regret</em><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> awaits.  Your writing will not catch fire, and the career you desire will fail to unfold.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20008" alt="tiger" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/tiger.png" width="300" height="181" /></p>
<p>The solution is to create something unique that&#8217;s drawn from the deepest wells of your own interests and fascinations, and readers will immediately sense the originality.</p>
<p>They’ll crave more, and the only author from which it is available is you.</p>
<p>This is how your life-long fan readership is built.</p>
<h3>Authenticity Is The Key To Growing Readership</h3>
<p>There’s no question that in the early days most writers need to copy, abstract, and simulate to discover their &#8216;voice&#8217;.  This is perfectly normal, but in the end your own voice needs to emerge with all its unique quirkiness and power.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20088" alt="top5regrets" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/top5regrets.jpg" width="160" height="233" /></p>
<p>Think about this:</p>
<p>In the palliative care book &#8220;The Top 5 Regrets Of The Dying&#8221;, the #1 regret expressed by people with only a few weeks to live, was they wished they&#8217;d been true to themselves.  But as they approached the end of their life, realized it was too late.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The power of your unique, innate talent </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">will go to work for you, if you have the confidence to trust it.</span></p>
<p>Are you trusting it?</p>
<p>Watch the <em>Human</em> video by <em>The Killers</em> group.  It’s a beautifully filmed expression of the question we all face.  And lastly, keep writing, no matter how much you think your muse has deserted you. Writing summons the creative muse, not the other way around.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em; color: #c43a3d;">What do you think? Are you being true to yourself with your writing? Have you found your voice? It’s never easy. Please do leave a comment.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19858" alt="Kristine-Wyllys-Header" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Kristine-Wyllys-header2.jpg" width="600" height="450" /></strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Today&#8217;s guest post is by Kristine Wyllys.</strong>  Her first book <strong>&#8216;Wild Ones&#8217;</strong> is a New Adult Contemporary Romance, published by Carina Press, with it&#8217;s sequel, &#8216;Losing Streak&#8217; following in September.</em></p>
<p><em>There&#8217;s no question that a little enthusiasm goes a long way, which is one of the reasons I&#8217;m running this guest post; Kristine overflows with it!  </em></p>
<p><em>It will be interesting to hear your opinion on the issues she identifies, so please do leave a comment after the post.  </em><em>Here&#8217;s what Kristine had to say about her deal, her books, and about the writing process.  </em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">&#8220;S</span><strong>ince I first announced that I had a book deal, I’ve found myself being asked for advice more and more often.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-19540"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12627" alt="Publishing contract" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/publishing-contract-s.jpg" width="200" height="133" />Sometimes, I’m able to distract the advice-seekers with pizza. I usually try. Because I’m not always convinced my brand of organized chaos is the best advice for someone to seek.</p>
<p>“HEY LOOK OVER THERE AT THAT LARGE PEPPERONI PIZZA FROM THE PLACE OF YOUR CHOOSING.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still here?</p>
<p>Awesome. You fall into that other group then. Which is cool. You’ve just passed the most important writing test of all: you’re impervious to distractions.</p>
<p>And if you want to be a published writer you need to be able to ignore distractions. Otherwise those deadlines go sailing right past you and you’re too busy studying that cloud shaped like a turtle to realize.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-19885" alt="Fire Book" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/firebook-s.jpg" width="257" height="188" />So since you’re serious about this,</strong> or at least not hungry at the moment, here’s the rest of my SO YOU WANT TO BE A WRITER list.</p>
<p>Have a child? A pet? An action figure you love more than most people? Perfect.  Look at that thing.  Imagine how much you love it and want to protect it.</p>
<p>Now imagine handing it over to someone and that person takes one look at it, throws it on the ground, then lights it on fire while screaming that your face makes them wanna puke shards of their pelvis.</p>
<p>Painful, right?  Nearly unbearable?  This is what putting a book out in the world is like.</p>
<p>You’re giving your baby to someone to light on fire and puke pelvis shards on.  Most people will not.  Most people will be so wonderful it’ll make you want to cry.  But every once in a while, someone will have matches in their pocket.  Make peace with that.</p>
<p><strong>Writing is weird.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12102" alt="writing" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/writing.jpg" width="250" height="200" /></p>
<p>You spend your time battling a blank screen and talking to characters in your head. It takes weird people to do it. Embrace that weirdness. Love your weirdness. Don’t bother fighting it. Know that the process is mad and you’re mad for it and worlds are born from that madness so it’s beautiful.</p>
<p>Listen to me. This is important. You’re gonna find yourself in a closet one day screaming at whoever passes by it that you’re a burrito. It’s fine. It’s cool. It’s part of the package.</p>
<p><strong>Bloggers</strong> are wonderful, magical, lovely people.  Appreciate them.  Appreciate them hard.</p>
<p>Don’t be a jerk.  This doubles as life advice.</p>
<p>Remember that people are watching or they will be.  So don’t leave the windows open while you get plastered with your skirt tucked into the back of your pantyhose.  Keep it classy.  Or, at least, have on nice underwear.</p>
<p><strong>Write for you first.</strong></p>
<p>Write for everyone else second.  If you’re not in love with what you’re doing, you can’t expect anyone else to be.</p>
<p>You are not an island.  Find your people.  It doesn’t matter who they are.  Find your people and keep them close.  You’re gonna need them.</p>
<p><strong>This is a subjective game.</strong></p>
<p>I’m sure you’ve heard that before and it’s the truth. What one person loves, another will hate. Don’t get discouraged by it. You’re not gonna ever, ever please everybody and that’s okay. Because you’ll please some people and that’s awesome.</p>
<p>Don’t get caught up in the daydreams that you’re going to be the Next Big Thing.  It’s okay to dream it.  It’s okay to have that tiny spark of hope inside of you that you will be. But at the end of the day, laugh, shuck your pants, and know that even if you never, ever see a best-sellers list, your words are out there for others to read.  You’re living a dream.</p>
<p>Okay. Got all that? Splendid.</p>
<p>So, how about that pizza now?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19689" alt="Stephen King - header" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/stephen-king-header.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">T</span>he book industry was rocked to its foundations last month when Tim Waterstone, founder of UK bookstore chain Waterstones, predicted the end of the eBook revolution in the UK.  According to &#8216;The Telegraph&#8217; he insists that the eBook is a declining fad, and that traditional printed <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10733708/Waterstones-founder-e-book-revolution-will-soon-go-into-decline.html" target="_blank">paper books</a> are not only as strong as ever, but are here to stay.</p>
<p><span id="more-19634"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-19664" alt="Tim" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/tim.jpg" width="140" height="111" />&#8220;The product is so strong, the interest in reading is so deeply rooted in the culture and human soul of this country that it is immovable. The traditional, physical book is hanging on. I’m absolutely sure we will be here in 40 years’ time.&#8221; <span style="font-size: small;"> Tim Waterstone</span></p></blockquote>
<h3>What Does Stephen King Think?</h3>
<p>When asked whether fiction books in the future would remain the same as they are now, the bestselling author replied unequivocally:  <em>&#8220;Absolutely they will not.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>In this 2 minute video, Stephen King reveals his thoughts on writing, whether traditionally printed paper books will survive, and also what will happen to book store chains.<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff; font-size: xx-small;">-</span></p>
<p><center><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0ELlianFnL0?rel=0" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />
<span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #ffffff;">-</span></center></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Do I Agree With Tim Waterstone, Or Stephen King?</h3>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2579" alt="The Invention of Hugo Cabret" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/hugo.jpg" width="150" height="225" /></p>
<p>I was brought up with paper books, and I&#8217;m permanently addicted to their texture and feel.  I love them, obsessively.</p>
<p>To the right is the cover of a richly illustrated book <em>&#8216;The Invention Of Hugo Cabret&#8217;</em> by Brian Selznick that I bought recently.  It&#8217;s a beautiful, tactile and desirable object I can pick up and riffle through.</p>
<p>Even more rewarding is that I can display one of my own works with pride on my coffee table, give one to a friend, or present a signed copy to a colleague &#8211; like a business card on steroids.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I see libraries full of whispering readers as great temples to the importance of the printed word.</p>
<p><strong>But&#8230; I&#8217;m not immune to reality</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>On Amazon, eBooks are crushing traditionally printed paper books.  In fact, according to Sci-Fi writer Hugh Howey on his &#8216;<a href="http://authorearnings.com/the-report/" target="_blank">Author Earnings&#8217;</a> site, 86% of the top 2,500 genre fiction best-sellers in the Amazon store are e-books.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-19778" alt="Pink Kindle " src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Pink-kindle.jpg" width="180" height="151" /></p>
<p>And for the top bestsellers, the dominance of e-books is even more startling: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">92% of the top-100 best-selling books are e-books.</span></p>
<p>The reason for this is the uber-low price of eBooks, instant accessibility and the convenience of carrying hundreds of books in one small reader device.</p>
<p>Given this evidence, I suspect Stephen King is correct, because as he points out, a<em> story</em> will transcend any current media.</p>
<p><strong>The bottom line is that irrespective of whether traditional printed books survive, or eBooks rule the literary cosmos, you&#8217;ll still be required to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">promote</span> them.</strong></p>
<p>My intention is to help guide you through the coming steel cage death-match between eBooks and traditional books with blog posts, my <a href="http://bestsellerlabs.com/twitter-for-authors/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://bestsellerlabs.com/blogging-for-authors/" target="_blank">Blogging</a> guides, and the other tutorials I’m creating.</p>
<p>Where do you feel the future of paper books lies?  I&#8217;d be interested to know your opinion.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ca343d;"><strong>Which path are you taking with your own books? Do you think eBooks will win? Or paper books?  Please do leave a comment.</strong></span></p>

<p><em>His next book <strong>&#8216;<i>Come Apart&#8217;</i></strong> is his third novel, a science fiction mystery in the tradition of &#8216;Lost&#8217; and &#8216;The Prisoner&#8217;.  It will be released in a few weeks.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Roger and I are very interested to hear your thoughts on this new post.  </em><em>Please do leave a comment at the end of the article.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-19492"></span></p>
<p><em>Over to Roger&#8230;</em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><img class="size-full wp-image-16264 alignleft" alt="Roger Colby" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Roger-Colby-with-name.jpg" width="110" height="125" />T</span>here are so many things that can distract writers.</p>
<p>Writers are thinkers and dreamers, and if there is anything I have learned from my son, who suffers from ADHD, it is that distractions can kill any chance of the completion of a task.</p>
<p>But what are the three things that are deadly for a writer, deadly vipers that might poison any chance of completing a project or a WIP?</p>
<p><strong>The following three would top my list:</strong></p>
<h3>1. Life</h3>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-19579" alt="Life" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/life.jpg" width="180" height="270" /></p>
<p>Perhaps you have angel wings and perhaps rainbows follow you everywhere and perhaps you ride to work every day on a unicorn that smells like angel-food cake, but quite frankly the world is a much more harsh environment for a writer than most.</p>
<p>Writers are typically sensitive to their world and often go around with their skin removed… at least poets and fiction writers.</p>
<p>It is tough, sometimes, to keep that world at bay enough to not let it bring us down. We are trying to write that romantic scene when our love life is in shambles, trying to write the happiest ending to our tale when the ending to our day was more of an out of control avalanche.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The Way Out:</strong></span></p>
<p>Do what writers do best &#8211; write about it.</p>
<p>Stop writing that scene that is a paradox to your life at the moment and write about what really happened to you today. It is a way to get it off of your chest (and not freak out your significant other with how sensitive you are to your surroundings).</p>
<h3>2. Writer’s Block – Let’s Face It</h3>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-19584" alt="Writer's Block" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blocked.jpg" width="180" height="226" /></p>
<p>You haven&#8217;t written in weeks, perhaps months, and you just can’t get back into the habit of cranking out the words. Perhaps you have grown bored with the WIP.  I once knew a writer who didn&#8217;t write for a year because he claimed that he had writer&#8217;s block.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The Way Out:</strong></span></p>
<p>Realize that writer&#8217;s block is a myth.</p>
<p>There are not blocked writers only lazy writers.  I’m sorry to punch you in the creative noggin, but this is a truth.</p>
<p>Writers write.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you write a poem today or a paragraph or a sentence, you should get to writing. Write nonsense for a few paragraphs and see what happens.</p>
<h3>3. Shattered Dreams of &#8220;Success&#8221;</h3>
<p>This one is a tough one.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-19589" alt="Bestseller Trophy" src="http://bestsellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bestseller-trophy-s.jpg" width="180" height="225" /></p>
<p>You have done everything (blogging, Twitter, Facebook, free Kindle days, e-mail blitzes, hired good editors, spent tons of money) and you have not seen the book sales you desire.  It has therefore soured any other attempts at writing another novel because you have had such little monetary success with the other effort.</p>
<p>This one can cause any writer to go on a downward spiral of despair in a hurry… the feeling that no matter what you do, you will never have the &#8220;success&#8221; of an Amanda Hocking.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The Way Out:</strong></span></p>
<p>What is your definition of &#8220;success&#8221;?  Mine is selling a few books now and again and once in a while getting a letter from a reader who liked my book.</p>
<p>Success is finishing one of those crazy novels that popped out of my head in the middle of the night after a fevered dream. You have to be realistic about dreams because in truth the best seller is not the best success you can have as a writer.</p>
<p>My latest novel made one of my proof-readers cry when she finished the last chapter.</p>
<p>That is success.</p>
