<p>But that’s exactly how long it took me to figure out how to get serious and treat my freelance career as a business.</p>
<p>I hope my story helps you figure it out a lot faster than that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-4059"></span></p>
<h2>I&#8217;m a freelancer?</h2>
<p>I did my first freelance writing in Seattle’s reality TV industry, when I was 23. During my interview with the production company, I was told the gig was temporary and would only last a few months.</p>
<p>It sounded great, so I accepted it — and the $13-an-hour salary that came with it.</p>
<p>But after talking with my coworkers, I found out I wasn’t a typical employee. In fact, I wasn’t an employee at all. I was a freelancer. And when they said the gig ended in March, they weren’t lying.</p>
<p>Over the next several years, I bounced around in gigs that lasted anywhere from three months to a year — with lapses of up to five months in between.</p>
<p>To survive, I took odd jobs doing everything from coaching soccer to selling cell phones. This hand-to-mouth cycle sucked, but seeing my name in the credits on TV made it seem worth it.</p>
<h2>Not making a living doing what I love</h2>
<p>Of course, reality (no pun intended!) eventually hit.</p>
<p>I was now 29, and had a six-week gig scripting TV. Talking with a fellow co-worker about money, I suddenly realized I made a higher hourly rate delivering pizzas than I did writing nationally broadcast TV.</p>
<p>That realization didn’t sit well with me, and I soon left.</p>
<p>I spent the next ten months in my hometown of Chicago, where my writing hit new lows. The only writing income I made was $25 from Fiverr.</p>
<p>Next, I decided to pack my bags and follow my girlfriend to Bangkok, Thailand. I took a job as an English teacher so I could survive while I figured things out.</p>
<h2>The turning point</h2>
<p>Last December, I read the book <em>Eat That Frog</em> by Brian Tracy. In the opening chapter, the author says the key to being successful at anything is to learn what other successful people are doing &#8212; and do the same.</p>
<p>This seemed obvious at first. But I realized that although I’d spent significant time developing my craft as a writer, I never cared to learn what successful freelancers were doing.</p>
<p>So I started learning. I joined the <a title="Freelance Writers Den" href="http://freelancewritersden.com" target="_blank">Freelance Writers Den</a>. On my hour-long commute to my full-time job, I read blogs and e-books by Ed Gandia, Danny Iny, and others. And I set aside 5 hours a week in the evenings to learn.</p>
<p>One big realization is that I had to stop fearing failure. I&#8217;ve started looking at all my business experiments as practice. If I fail, then it&#8217;s not a big deal. It&#8217;s just practice, and I&#8217;ll get better as I go along if I keep going.</p>
<h2>Taking action</h2>
<p>Another thing I realized? My biggest challenge was marketing. It was scary, and I hated it. But if I was ever going to actually make a living writing, I needed to suck it up.</p>
<p>I started by asking family and friends for referrals. No dice.</p>
<p>I sent letters of introduction to hotels that had poorly translated English websites. But none of them could afford a writer, so that was a dead end.</p>
<p>After about six months, I began<a title="7 Networking Tips for Cowards" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/7-networking-tips-for-cowards/" target="_blank"> going to local networking events</a> hosted by Meetup and the Chambers of Commerce in the embassies here in Bangkok. Once I took the advice of the freelancers I was following and started looking to make friends, not just find work, I started to really enjoy in-person networking.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when I started making progress. I eventually found all three of my current clients through networking.</p>
<h2>Finding clients</h2>
<p>My first client came this past August. I used the lessons I learned — and the templates provided — in the <a title="Freelance Business Bootcamp" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/ebooks" target="_blank">Freelance Business Bootcamp</a> offered within the Freelance Writers Den. It was the first time I ever created a freelance writing contract, negotiated the payment myself, and truly felt in control of my freelance destiny.</p>
<p>Eight years in, and I was finally acting like a real freelancer.</p>
<p>When I got three clients, I quit my full-time job. I have a great variety of work teaching writing to one client, writing video scripts for another, and writing content and web copy for a travel/backpacking site.</p>
<p>And even though some of the rates aren&#8217;t what I&#8217;d ask for now, I feel awesome that I negotiated them myself. My best rate — and my easiest client to work with — came when I entered the negotiation with a solid idea of what other people charged for that type of work and the knowledge that I could walk away if I didn&#8217;t get that rate. I&#8217;m actually prepping to re-negotiate one of my lower-paying clients, and I am ready to quit if they can&#8217;t meet my new rate.</p>
<h2>Having a good problem</h2>
<p>I’m drowning in work now, and I&#8217;ve turned down a few other clients already! I&#8217;m not sending out LOIs, but I am still attending networking events.</p>
<p>This whole &#8220;being swamped with clients&#8221; thing is kind of new to me. And it’s kind of scary.</p>
<p>So what am I doing? Same as before…learning how others handle <a title="How I became a more productive writer by doing this one simple thing" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/productive-writer-one-simple/" target="_blank">juggling multiple clients</a>, and doing the same myself.</p>

<p>Do you sometimes feel like an easily replaceable cog in the vast wheel that is the freelance writing marketplace?</p>
<p>If so, you're not alone.</p>
<p>With all the $5 or $10-a-post writing gigs online, it's easy to feel writing has simply become a cheap activity -- and that clients don't appreciate the work you do.</p>
<p>Here's one email I got recently that perfectly sums up the problem many writers face:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>"The thing I struggle with is that I am unable to land a gig where the client really values what I do. Since the clients I worked with have a number of writers on the rolls, they always treat each writer as just another disposable commodity. Which is worrying, because it means they will drop me any time they want.</p>
<p>"So how I do go about building a relationship where I'm not just another writer?"--Ryan</p></blockquote>
<p>Great question! That's exactly what you want to do if you're going to become a successful, well-paid freelance writer. Here's how:</p>

<p>If so, you&#8217;re not alone.</p>
<p>With all the $5 or $10-a-post writing gigs online, it&#8217;s easy to feel writing has simply become a cheap activity &#8212; and that clients don&#8217;t appreciate the work you do.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The thing I struggle with is that I am unable to land a gig where the client really values what I do.

<p>&#8220;So how I do go about building a relationship where I&#8217;m not just another writer?&#8221;&#8211;Ryan</p></blockquote>
<p>Great question! That&#8217;s exactly what you want to do if you&#8217;re going to become a successful, well-paid freelance writer. Here are seven ways to get there:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-3723"></span></p>
<h2>1. Learn to qualify prospects</h2>
<p>First off, to get paid well, you have to find companies that have serious money available to pay you. They&#8217;re successful.</p>
<p>In general, they sell a real product or service in the real world. And they&#8217;ve been around a few years.</p>
<p>Realize that most Craigslist advertisers, and most online platforms promising you great &#8220;opportunities,&#8221; simply aren&#8217;t the client you want. Yes, it&#8217;s so easy to sign up for those&#8230;but you&#8217;ll be caught in the disposable-commodity trap.</p>
<p>You <a title="Get great freelance clients" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/get-great-freelance-clients/" target="_blank">get better clients</a> by researching prospects, identifying good ones &#8212; or finding magazines that pay good rates &#8212; and proactively marketing to them.</p>
<p>When you contact these prospects, they&#8217;ll be looking to build relationships with good writers, because they&#8217;re doing *real* business, not waiting for ad-clicks on a website. They don&#8217;t have time to be constantly auditioning new writers.</p>
<h2>2. Avoid the masses</h2>
<p>I have yet to see an online platform with hundreds of writers working for it that pays well. There is no such business model.</p>
<p>The presence of many writers working for a single client creates an atmosphere that devalues our skills. It&#8217;s also often impossible to build a relationship, because the work is done through an anonymous platform where you may not even know the end client&#8217;s identity.</p>
<p>Any ad you see from a place gushing about how they&#8217;re hiring dozens of writers and have *loads* or work for you, be wary. In my experience, that&#8217;s code for &#8220;I pay crap, and think of writers as Kleenex I can quickly use up and discard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Set phasers to ignore, and move on to find successful companies to work for.</p>
<h2>3. Meet live humans</h2>
<p>Getting out and talking to prospects in person is a great way to find better clients. Even if it&#8217;s a small business with a small marketing budget, I think they&#8217;re less likely to pay you a shockingly low wage when you&#8217;ve met face-to-face. It&#8217;s also a great way to build meaningful relationships with contacts who might do more than hire you &#8212; they might recommend and refer you.</p>
<h2>4. Build authority</h2>
<p>One of the most accessible ways writers can start from scratch and begin earning well is to grab attention online, through their own blog or guest posting for big blogs.</p>
<p>Write on topics that will show your writing expertise to best advantage. I can tell you, the best-paying clients I&#8217;ve gotten in recent years all approached me after seeing my writing on popular blogs. That includes both of my <a title="How to start your business on a shoestring" href="http://shoestringstartup.com" target="_blank">traditional print book</a> contracts. Good clients are doing online searches to find the right writer, because it saves them a ton of time over placing an ad or asking around.</p>
<p>When the client approaches you, they&#8217;re <em>dying</em> to build a relationship with you. They&#8217;ve decided you are the writer they simply must have for their project.</p>
<h2>5. Specialize in a topic</h2>
<p>Another way to build authority that reliably works is to choose a topic area and keep writing on it. The more you research and write on a topic, the more sophisticated your knowledge becomes. That allows you to move up to bigger, better-paying clients over time.</p>
<p>This is exactly how I went from writing for an alternative city paper to a business weekly to a regional business monthly magazine, to <em>Entrepreneur</em> and <em>Forbes</em>. I chugged along covering startups, franchising, and business finance, building my source list and learning more, until I could command top magazine rates for my stories.</p>
<h2>6. Know a product</h2>
<p>If there is a type of product you enjoy learning about, this can be a great way to build expertise. Maybe it&#8217;s apps, software-as-a-service, oil drilling, or jewelry-making. When you&#8217;ve written about one, start marketing your services to other companies that sell a similar thing.</p>
<p>In any complex industry, finding good writers is a nightmare for companies. And they don&#8217;t have time to teach anybody the fine points. If you know their product, they are thrilled to find you and pay you well to stick around.</p>
<h2>7. Sell value instead of hours</h2>
<p>This requires a massive mindshift &#8212; but if you do it, you can earn a lot more.</p>
<p>Writers tend to have a wage-slave, starvation mentality. Many tell me they&#8217;re happy to get $17 an hour for writing or editing, because they imagine they can squeak by on that&#8230;and are worried they&#8217;ll be out of a gig if they ask for professional rates.</p>
<p>Now, flip this equation over. If you write for businesses especially, stop basing what you charge on your life circumstances, past pay rates you&#8217;ve earned at your day jobs, or the total of your monthly bills.</p>
<p>Instead, think of the value you&#8217;re delivering to the client. Will the sales page or brochure or Web copy you&#8217;re writing enable that client to bring in $100,000 more business? You deserve a cut of that. Considered this way, a $5,000 fee is peanuts compared to all that new revenue for the client &#8212; and that&#8217;s how you pitch it in your proposal.</p>
<p>Selling value instead of hours is the approach that builds great client relationships, and puts freelance writers into the six-figure annual earning category.</p>

<p>It turns out they didn’t like their voice and wanted to go in a different direction. They asked me how I saw myself “fitting in” — a clear sign of doubt. </p>

<p>It turns out, they didn’t like their voice and wanted to go in a different direction. They asked me how I saw myself “fitting in” — a clear sign of doubt.</p>
<p>So I asked for a meeting. Drawing on my background as a slam poet, I paid attention to the way the client spoke and asked questions about their desired voice. The client left the meeting hopeful and satisfied. I won their trust, and I did it using slam poetry.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how &#8212; and why &#8212; I became the one writer this client wanted to work with:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-4091"></span></p>
<h2>What is slam poetry?</h2>
<p>Slam poetry ain’t your mama’s poetry.</p>
<p>Poetry is what makes English students want to light themselves on fire.</p>
<p>Slam poetry is hip-hop music’s eccentric cousin. It’s about wordplay and storytelling, not strict adherence to an arbitrary structure.</p>
<h2>Find the right voice</h2>
<p>My client’s primary concern was voice.</p>
<p>In copywriting, a business’ voice can impact sales. This client thought their voice was too formal, and they wanted more modern content.</p>
<p>Slam poetry has helped me <a title="How Creative Writing Made Me a Better Blogger" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/creative-writing-blogger/" target="_blank">master voice</a>. If you’re struggling with your “writing voice,” listen to different poets. You’ll uncover the devices they use to create a distinct voice, and you can try different tactics to help you do the same.</p>
<h2>Choose words wisely</h2>
<p>The words you choose convey a lot of information about you.</p>
<p>If you want clients to identify with you, you need to talk like them. Spoken word works by using the right word in the right place at the right time. Certain words have persuasive power, and certain other words can have negative connotations.</p>
<p>I noticed that my client used warm and casual words. By choosing more informal language, I was able to connect with her on a personal level.</p>
<h2>Pop-culture shortcuts build rapport</h2>
<p>Who doesn’t love a well-placed pop culture reference? Spoken-word poetry, a performance by nature, is all about speaker-audience interaction and shared stories.</p>
<p><a title="The Carly Simon Guide to Freelance Superstardom" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/carly-simon-guide-overcoming-freelance-fears-achieving-superstardom/" target="_blank">Pop culture references</a> are a great way to quickly create solidarity with your audience.</p>
<p>My client said she’d send me an email, to which I replied, “awesome possum!” Unbeknownst to me, that slang term’s been around for decades. So my client, who is 20 years my senior, laughed and said that she hadn’t heard that expression in years. This one little phrase established an instant rapport!</p>
<p>Slam poetry might seem intimidating at first, but it’s actually quite easy. It doesn’t follow traditional rules, so you don’t need to know anything about sonnets to write it. The tools you learn from slam can even net you new clients.</p>
<p>In just two short weeks I’ve already earned an extra couple hundred dollars — and I owe it to slam.</p>

I get asked that a lot.</p>
<p>Writers get sick of the hustle and grind of trying to scare up more gigs. Or they tire of being broke all the time.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t there an easier way to earn more money as a freelance writer?</p>
<p>As it happens, there is.</p>
<p>There is one great way to earn more money as a freelance writer that doesn&#8217;t rely on marketing. It&#8217;s my favorite way to earn more, too, as it does not involve working any harder.</p>
<p>Bonus: Now is the perfect time of year to lay the groundwork and make this happen.</p>
<h2>What do you charge?</h2>
<p>The simplest way to grow your income as a freelance writer is to get paid more to do what you&#8217;re already doing. In other words, get a raise from your existing clients.</p>
<p>No marketing needed &#8212; no auditioning, writing sample articles, answering ads, going to networking events, sending queries, nothing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so simple! Yet so many writers fail to take advantage of this great opportunity to earn more.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that for this to work, you need to already have clients. And they need to be the right type of client &#8212; the kind where you can get a raise &#8212; <a title="Writing for content mills writers' true stories" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/write-content-mills-writers-true-stories/" target="_blank">not a content mill</a> where they&#8217;ve been paying $15 or $20 for articles for years, and it&#8217;ll never change. Or a revenue-share situation where you earn pennies for ad clicks. Only a miracle will earn you more at these sort of places.</p>
<p>My experience in mentoring hundreds of writers is that new writers often bid too low, and then rarely ask clients for more money. Even though over time, their expertise in that client&#8217;s business and their sector usually grow dramatically.</p>
<p>Often, all you have to do is get more is simply to ask. If you&#8217;ve been writing for a client for 60-90 days, you can often get a raise at that early point. That&#8217;s enough time to make yourself indispensable to the client. You don&#8217;t have to wait a year or more!</p>
<p>Some writers tell me they <a title="5 signs you're ready to raise your freelance rates" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/5-signs-ready-raise-freelance-rates/" target="_blank">don&#8217;t feel ready</a> to ask for a raise yet, or they need to gain <a title="How to feel confident charging more as a freelance writer" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/freelancers-feel-confident-charging/" target="_blank">confidence that they&#8217;re worth more</a>.</p>
<p>Let me help: You&#8217;re worth more. Yes, I can tell from here.</p>
<p>Why is now the best time to get a raise? Well, my <a title="Raise your freelance writing rates" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/raise-freelance-writing-rates/" target="_blank">proven approach to getting raises</a> takes six weeks to execute. Six weeks from now, it&#8217;s a new year. That&#8217;s why this is the perfect moment.</p>
<h2>6 Weeks to more money</h2>
<p>If you give your client a lot of notice near year-end, it&#8217;s fairly easy to get a raise. I&#8217;ll demonstrate why. It takes six weeks for this method to play out &#8212; here are the steps:</p>
<p>1) Notify your client this week that your rates are going up starting in 2015. I suggest a simple script along these lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For some time now, my rates have been rising, but I&#8217;ve kept your rate stable because I love working with you. However, at this point I won&#8217;t be working at this rate in future. I&#8217;m writing to let you know that starting in 2015, my rates are going up from $X to $X (usually 10%-15% more).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>2) Client gets note. Scans it. Sees it says something&#8217;s happening in &#8220;2015.&#8221; Client makes a mental note that this isn&#8217;t something urgent that&#8217;s happening this week. They don&#8217;t have to think about it right now. They can go back to the million emergencies they&#8217;re dealing with because it&#8217;s almost year-end.</p>
<p>3) If you don&#8217;t hear back, you&#8217;ve got two options. Get back in touch and insist they sign a revised contract, or simply start charging more on Jan. 1. You know <a title="Why writers earn more with a simple piece of paper" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/freelance-writers-earn-more-simple-paper/" target="_blank">I recommend having a contract</a>, but your call. I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;ve used the sneaky approach in the past, and it&#8217;s worked out.</p>
<p>4) If you haven&#8217;t gotten confirmation yet, remind them right before Christmas that your rates are going up.</p>
<p>5) Client is headed out the door for the holidays, and realizes time got away from them on this one. Now, they&#8217;ll never find a replacement for you before Jan. 1. They think about it and realize they like your work, and it&#8217;s probably not worth the effort to break in a new writer &#8212; it&#8217;s easier to just pay you a little more.</p>
<p>6) When you bill for January work, you&#8217;re at the higher rate.</p>
<p>One tip: I&#8217;ve found asking for a modest raise pretty foolproof. But I also know writers who were being radically underpaid, who asked for and got 50%-100% raises. So consider your situation and your client, and think carefully about how big a raise you want to shoot for.</p>
<p>Small raises increase your odds that clients will simply agree without giving it a lot of thought, but sometimes the pay is so low you should either quit or get a substantial raise.</p>
<h2>When you can&#8217;t ask for more</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s one big rule of asking for a raise from an existing client: You can&#8217;t do it unless you&#8217;re ready to walk if they don&#8217;t agree.</p>
<p>If they say &#8216;no&#8217; to the raise and you stay, they&#8217;ll never respect you again. This client is now a dead end. You&#8217;ll never earn more here.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re absolutely petrified about asking existing clients for a raise, or simply not in the scenario where you can risk losing the client, you can still help yourself earn more.</p>
<p>How? Raise your rates for new clients.</p>
<p>Grandfather in your old clients at your existing rate, but anybody new pays more. Then, gradually replace those older clients with the higher-paying ones as you go. Once again, this doesn&#8217;t add to your marketing workload &#8212; it&#8217;s just part of what you tell prospects.</p>
<p><em><strong>Will you raise your rates in 2015?</strong> </em>Leave a comment and tell us how you&#8217;ll make it happen.</p>

<p>I’m afraid of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>I don’t mean the financial kind. I mean the kind where you get an exciting writing commission, and then you can't deliver.</p>
<p>Creative bankruptcy happens when you have a pressing writing project — and you know you’ve got nothing.</p>
<p>Don’t put yourself in that position.</p>
<p>Here are three ways you can avoid creative bankruptcy and become a more productive professional writer.</p>

<p>I don’t mean the financial kind. I mean the kind where you get an exciting writing commission, and then you can&#8217;t deliver.</p>
<p>Creative bankruptcy happens when you have a pressing writing project — and you know you’ve got nothing.</p>
<p>Don’t put yourself in that position.</p>
<p>Here are three ways you can avoid creative bankruptcy and become a more productive professional writer.</p>
<p><span id="more-4048"></span></p>
<h2>1. Research your idols and competitors</h2>
<p>Don’t reinvent the wheel with each new writing project. Instead, research what the writers you admire are creating content about.</p>
<p><a title="Buzzsumo" href="http://buzzsumo.com/" target="_blank">BuzzSumo</a> and <a title="Social Crawlytics" href="https://socialcrawlytics.com/" target="_blank">Social Crawlytics</a> are two tools you can use to find that out.</p>
<p>Using BuzzSumo, you can find key influencers and see what type of content they created. You can also search a blog or website for popular posts by topic or author.</p>
<p>With Social Crawlytics, you can analyze a website or blog and find popular articles, according to their social shares.</p>
<h2>2. Invest in your creativity bank</h2>
<p>Professional writers need a creativity bank for depositing ideas.</p>
<p>If you have one, the next time you are creatively bankrupt, you can withdraw from your savings account of ideas and keep earning for your writing.</p>
<p>To build your creativity bank, get into the habit of recording five or ten ideas for topics you want to write about or ideas you have for future assignments.</p>
<p>Don’t judge these ideas. It doesn’t matter how good they are. And you don’t need to act on them. The point is to record them.</p>
<p>Do this for seven days, and you’ll have 35–70 ideas. Do it for a month, and you’ll have 150–300 ideas. Plus, you’ll also have a lot of <a title="2 ways to become that writer with a million story ideas" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/2-ways-writer-million-story-ideas/" target="_blank">practice coming up with ideas</a> — so you can draw on those skills when you need something new.</p>
<h2>3. Take the pressure off</h2>
<p>Writing is demanding — and those of us who put words on the page for money feel an extra pressure to create.</p>
<p>If you’re having an unproductive day (or year), reduce your expectations and lower the bar.</p>
<p>Focus on progressing on your current project in some small way.</p>
<p>If you’re having trouble finishing your article, settle for writing five headlines.</p>
<p>Instead of writing your next chapter, outline it.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about completing five interviews &#8212; just schedule them.</p>
<p>Lowering the bar enables you to end the day without experiencing a sense of failure. Sometimes, just turning up is a win.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not advocating procrastination. Instead, your goal should be to move your project along in small increments and then take a break and <a title="The Impulsive Writer’s Productivity Secret: 3 Reasons to Write What You Want" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/how-i-earned-by-writing-now/" target="_blank">complete it when you&#8217;re rested</a>.</p>
<p>If all else fails, ask your client for an extension &#8212; you&#8217;d be surprised how often that&#8217;s no big deal.</p>
<h2>Your path to creative prosperity</h2>
<p>Being a professional writer is tough. But you have tools you can use to keep yourself working, even when you don’t feel inspired.</p>
<p>Check what your competitors are doing. Make sure you have a bank of ideas you can reuse. And if you’re really stuck, go a little easier on yourself.</p>

<p>Many new writers looking to find that first place they can break in and start earning money from their craft end up signing up for a content mill.</p>
<p>Either that, or they end up discovering a revenue-share site like <a title="How I make a full time living blogging on examiner" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/full-time-living-blogging-examiner/" target="_blank">Examiner</a> or <a title="Writing for Guardian Liberty Voice" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/writing-for-guardian-liberty-voice/" target="_blank">Guardian Liberty Voice</a>, or <a title="Bidding on Elance - how freelancers get screwed" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/bidding-on-elance-how-freelancers-get-screwed/" target="_blank">bidding for gigs on Elance</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-4064 size-medium" src="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/Road-sign-many-arrows-300x200.jpg" alt="Many choices in content mills" width="300" height="200" />Many new writers looking to find that first place they can break in and start earning money from their craft end up signing up for a content mill.</p>

<p>Soon after, many of these writers are sending me emails like this one:</p>
<p><span id="more-4009"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a new writer and I was thinking about signing up for Textbroker. What do you think about them?</p>
<p>&#8220;I also registered for Demand Studios &#8212; waiting for approval &#8212; and created a Fiverr profile. I was wondering what your opinion is of those, or if there is a better site I should join?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>The myth of the better content mill</h2>
<p>Aah, the worry that maybe you&#8217;ve chosen the wrong content mill.</p>
<p>Hope springs eternal within writers&#8217; hearts, that somewhere on our vast interwebs, there could be a content mill that pays great. Or a revenue-share site where your posts would earn you a small fortune in affiliate ad revenue, or a mass bidding platform where prices won&#8217;t be nearly nil.</p>
<p>You think maybe, it&#8217;s just a matter of looking harder. Because there must be some mistake, right? You&#8217;re making a pittance here!</p>
<p>Insecure writers tend to blame themselves when things go wrong. It must be me, we think. If only I were a better writer or researcher, I could discover the Valhalla where you write keyword-stuffed quickie content on any topic you like, that doesn&#8217;t require interviews, expertise, or much research &#8212; but it still pays terrific.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem to matter how much reporting I do on <a title="Content mill founder quits will freelance writers follow" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/content-mill-founder-quits-will-freelance-writers-follow/" target="_blank">why content mills&#8217; business model is failing</a> and won&#8217;t ever offer a living wage to writers. (Have you checked out what&#8217;s happened to the <a title="Seeking Alpha DMD" href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/2676575-update-demand-media-reports-q3-earnings-but-is-still-an-avoid" target="_blank">stock of Demand Studios</a>&#8216; parent Demand Media lately, since they spun off their domain-name business and have only the content mills left? Investors get it.)</p>
<p>Still comes the question: &#8220;Which is the best content mill for me to join?&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like to be the person who bursts writers&#8217; bubbles, but there is no best content mill. Wish there was&#8230;but no.</p>
<h2>Taking bad advice</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to see how writers get sucked into this dream, that a better content mill is out there, somewhere.</p>
<p>After all, there so many posts online about the best content mills to join! I did a Google search recently, and found &#8220;best content mills&#8221; gets 106 million results.</p>
<p>I turned up insightful advice, such as that the secret is to &#8220;<a title="5 best content mills" href="http://onlinemoneymaking4all.com/5-best-content-mills-for-making-money-online/" target="_blank">join as many as you can</a>.&#8221; As if trying to keep up with one mill&#8217;s arcane rules, editor demands, and weird topic requests isn&#8217;t enough.</p>
<p>Scan these &#8220;best content mill&#8221; posts, and you&#8217;ll often learn their recommended, best, top mills pay $3 an article. So much better than the ones that only pay $1!</p>
<p>I always hope that alarm bells will ring for writers as they see these rates&#8230;that there&#8217;ll be a &#8220;wait a minute&#8221; gut-check, and they&#8217;ll move on and look for decent-paying clients. But for many, the lure of easy money is too great.</p>
<h2>Changing your vision</h2>
<p>Soon, these same writers are asking me if I can teach them how to write fast enough to crank out ten articles a day &#8212; because that&#8217;s the only way they&#8217;ll earn enough to survive at a mill. And mills are all many writers know.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a crisis of lack of vision. If you can&#8217;t conceive that there is any better writing gig out there, content mills are where you write.</p>
<p>I heard just this week from one writer who wanted to know if $25 was a good article rate or not. She&#8217;d recently moved up from a $10 article mill, and her editor was telling her she was lucky to repeatedly revise her articles for him at this magnificent rate. That this was pretty much the top rate.</p>
<p>I told her the <a title="How I wrote a $2,000 freelance article in a week flat" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/high-paid-freelance-article-writing/" target="_blank">last article I wrote paid $2,000</a>. When I got paid for my first essay in the late 1980s, I got $200.</p>
<p>If a raise from $10 to $25 is super-exciting to you, and you can feed your family on that, then ignore this whole article and write for mills.</p>
<p>But from where I sit, it&#8217;s not going to make a meaningful difference for anyone writing in any first world country. Writing for content mills will never get you in the ballpark of replacing your day-job income.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a whole alternative universe of great-paying writing markets out there. But <a title="Can you really earn a living as a freelance writer?" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/earn-living-freelance-writer/" target="_blank">you have to believe they exist</a> &#8212; and then you have to be willing to expend some effort to find them.</p>
<h2>5 Basic laws of writing online</h2>
<p>Given how often I&#8217;m getting asked which content mill is best, I thought it might be helpful to put together a concise list of basics to know when looking for writing gigs online. Consider these my five<a title="Natural laws of freelance writing" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/3-natural-laws-freelance-writing-understand-earn/" target="_blank"> business laws for freelance writers</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Content mills, by definition, must underpay writers. Whenever mass content is needed, prices must be low, or the mill won&#8217;t turn a profit for its owners.</li>
<li>Revenue share sites can only pay based on your traffic &#8212; which will mostly be tiny. Don&#8217;t write for them without at least <a title="How I learned to love writing for revenue share" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/revenue-share-websites-learned-love/" target="_blank">some guaranteed revenue</a>.</li>
<li>Mass job bidding sites will always offer mostly rock-bottom prices.</li>
<li>Anywhere thousands of writers are present, market forces will drive prices down, down, down. It will be difficult to earn professional rates.</li>
<li>The only proven approach for building a lucrative freelance income is proactively prospecting to find your own clients.</li>
</ol>
<p>To sum up, it&#8217;s not you &#8212; it&#8217;s the business model of mass writing and bidding platforms. Trying to find a better content mill is like trying to find a spot on the Earth where there isn&#8217;t gravity. It doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t waste your time switching from one content mill or big freelance-gig website to another, or signing up for many sites in hopes that one will be a winner. That&#8217;s time you could spend <a title="Get great freelance clients " href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/get-great-freelance-clients/" target="_blank">finding great clients</a> who respect the value you bring, and pay you appropriately.</p>

<p>With a deep breath, I pressed "send" on an email containing months of research and my first article for a <a title="Caroltice.com - 5 good paying writing niches" href="http://www.caroltice.com/5-good-paying-writing-niches" target="_blank">trade magazine</a>.</p>
<p>It was done!</p>
<p>But my excitement was short-lived when my editor replied. I'd called her the wrong name. I screwed up before she even looked at my story.</p>
<p>I panicked. Would she blacklist me? Would she even read my pitch now? Did I just cut myself out of a potentially great freelance writing gig?</p>
<p>Turns out, it all worked out okay. One year later, I'm her editorial assistant.</p>
<p>How did I get myself out of this jam and land a great freelance gig? I focused on three E's.</p>

<p>It was done!</p>
<p>But my excitement was short-lived when my editor replied. I&#8217;d called her the wrong name. I screwed up before she even looked at my story.</p>
<p>I panicked. Would she blacklist me? Would she even read my pitch now? Did I just cut myself out of a potentially great freelance writing gig?</p>
<p>Turns out, it all worked out okay. One year later, I&#8217;m her editorial assistant.</p>
<p>How did I get myself out of this jam and land a great freelance gig? I focused on three E&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-4020"></span></p>
<h2>Excellence</h2>
<p>I immediately replied to the editor with an apology. Thankfully, <a title="How to Conquer Your Terror of Screwing Up a Freelance Writing Gig" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/conquer-terror-screwing-freelance-writing-gig/" target="_blank">my gaffe would be forgotten,</a> because my story on virtual assistants was the best I&#8217;d written in a while.</p>
<p>She gave me another assignment! In return, every email was professional, my stories were done well and on time. Naturally, I always double-checked to make sure I called her by her correct name. At one point, she said I was a great writer. (I saved that email.)</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>For Your Checklist</strong><br />
Step one in maintaining a great writer-editor relationship: create high-quality work in a timely fashion. Use the best sources you can find, adjust to the publication&#8217;s writing style and complete edits immediately.</p></blockquote>
<p>Always over-deliver.</p>
<h2>Empathy</h2>
<p>I noticed a few things about my editor. She sometimes takes a while to respond. I&#8217;d have to send multiple copies of an invoice.</p>
<p>Turns out, she was overwhelmed with work. She revealed her job encompassed far more than editing the magazine. I became a welcome ear.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>For Your Checklist</strong><br />
It&#8217;s easier to be annoyed with your editor than empathize with her. But try it, even if it&#8217;s tough.</p></blockquote>
<p>If an editor apologizes for a late email, tell her you understand — everyone&#8217;s juggling work. Get to know her as a person and not a faceless entity behind an email address.</p>
<h2>Enthusiasm</h2>
<p>She was opening up to me, and I was grateful. One day, I emailed her jokingly that I wanted to move to where the magazine was published so I could work for her full time.</p>
<p>Apparently this gave her an idea. In a later email, she asked about helping more with the magazine. I&#8217;d get assigned features and assist with other sections.</p>
<p>A few phone calls later, it was done. I was an editorial assistant. The best part? She was so grateful for the help and included me in planning for 2015. My editor valued my input.</p>
<p>I made my excitement known and continue to do so. Generally, I don&#8217;t use emoticons and exclamation points in professional email correspondence. I broke that rule when I got this opportunity. I&#8217;m always grateful to do the work, even when it&#8217;s difficult.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>For Your Checklist</strong><br />
Being enthusiastic implies, &#8220;I love my work, and I want more.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep. <a title="Can This Heartfelt Emotion Guide You to Better Freelance Clients?" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/emotion-guide-freelance-clients/" target="_blank">Excitement equals assignments.</a></p>
<p>Your editors may not react the same way mine did, but trust me, these three E&#8217;s will take you a long way in your writing career.</p>

I have been known to assume the fetal position and moan softy for prolonged periods when I can&#8217;t get some widget to work right.</p>
<p>Or to think seriously about flinging a computer out a window.</p>
<p>So I feel for writers when I get questions like these:</p>
<p><span id="more-4011"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I want to leave a comment on your <a title="Freelance Writers Den" href="http://freelancewritersden.com/" target="_blank">Freelance Writers Den</a> forum, but I can&#8217;t figure out how.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you enliven words with a link?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My client wants me to write and publish posts inside their WordPress system, but I&#8217;ve never used WordPress. Help!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>You can do this</h2>
<p>The first step to becoming more technically adept is to change your attitude. You&#8217;ve got to <a title="Why Hating your day job doesn't mean you'll be a successful freelance writer" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/hating-day-job-not-successful-freelance-writer/" target="_blank">stop acting all helpless</a> about tech, to earn well as a writer today. You can&#8217;t throw your hands in the air and declare the problem unsolvable.</p>
<p>Because I can tell you, it isn&#8217;t. Despite possessing a natural ineptitude that borders on tech phobia, I&#8217;ve gone from complete ignoramus to solidly competent online.</p>
<p>I can code an ad in my blog sidebar. I can move widgets around. I can use membership and mailing list software. I put up blog posts with images, embedded videos, and slideshows in my clients&#8217; WordPress dashboards.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been able to confidently pitch and land gigs that require the mastery of these technologies&#8230;often when I didn&#8217;t yet know how to do them.</p>
<p>How&#8217;d I go from typewriter-bound, old-school journalist to a writer with solid tech skills? Here are my simple tips:</p>
<h2>1. Find a guide</h2>
<p>Before you freak out about how you can&#8217;t figure out how to leave a comment or use a tool on some website, start looking around the site. Often, you can find a guide to how to do it.</p>
<p>For instance, on Freelance Writers Den, we&#8217;ve got an Orientation Guide with screenshots and everything. It walks you step-by-step through how to start a topic, find out if someone replied to your comment, how to upload your profile photo, send a private message, and more. For my <a title="Useful Writing Courses" href="http://usefulwritingcourses.com" target="_blank">Useful Writing Courses</a> that I teach with Linda Formichelli, we&#8217;ve created handouts called &#8220;How to get the most out of this class&#8221; that have our tech basics spelled out.</p>
<p>Most sites with any technical complexity put these together, because they save time answering emailed questions. Look for FAQs &#8212; they may solve your whole problem.</p>
<h2>2. Get free online training</h2>
<p>If the site or platform you&#8217;re using doesn&#8217;t have a guide, you can find tons of free training online for any basic technical issue, simply by typing the question you have into Google. Like this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4045 " src="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-11-07-at-2.07.41-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-11-07 at 2.07.41 PM" width="438" height="533" /></p>
<p>Did you note how many results there were for that question? Really, stop stumbling about in the dark. Help is available.</p>
<p>One of my favorite free-training spots is <a title="W3Schools" href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>, which is packed with great basic trainings on HTML and CSS coding (and more, but the rest of their topics are too technical for me!). For learning WordPress, look no further than <a title="WordPress lessons" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Lessons" target="_blank">WordPress.org</a>, which is stocked with dozens of free lessons.</p>
<h2>3. Take a quick class</h2>
<p>If you want to learn a tech area in more depth, check your local library, parks and recreation agency, or community college. For instance, I&#8217;ve noticed my library is giving classes in how to successfully download and use various types of media files. These are great for low-tech people vs online classes, since you don&#8217;t have to learn anything technical just to take them.</p>
<p>Downloading might seem basic to some of us, but the library is willing to spend two hours going over that with you. Some of these classes are free, and some charge a nominal fee. It&#8217;ll be worth it to stop feeling like you&#8217;re a dinosaur who sinking slowly into a technical tar pit.</p>
<h2>4. Read techie blogs</h2>
<p>Google several of your tech questions, and you&#8217;ll probably find the same sites come up repeatedly in your results. Subscribe to those blogs, and you&#8217;ll see a series of posts that may help you. Set aside even ten minutes a week to scan through those, and you&#8217;ll pick up fine points of how to do things a bit better.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s always shortcuts and new twists you could learn &#8212; for instance, I picked up a couple handy tips from this recent <a title="Wordpress Hacks - Boost blog traffic" href="http://boostblogtraffic.com/wordpress-hacks/" target="_blank">post on WordPress hacks</a>.</p>
<p>You might also Google the general tech topic you most want to learn about, and subscribe to blogs you find that way. Half the stuff might be completely over your head, but don&#8217;t let that bother you. Hang in for the valuable tip or two that fits exactly what you need, and discard the rest for now.</p>
<h2>5. Get a tech friend</h2>
<p>If you learn best having someone explain tech stuff to you one-on-one, try to locate a tech person who&#8217;ll take pity on you. You&#8217;ve got writing skills &#8212; maybe you could do a tradeout and rewrite their website copy?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re willing to spend a little bit, teens are bursting with this knowledge and will work for minimum wage. Take an hour or two of their time, and suddenly, you won&#8217;t feel so stupid.</p>
<h2>6. If they ask if you can&#8230;</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s my biggest secret: You can learn tech on the fly for a client. If they ask if you can use a platform or tool to work with them, just say &#8220;yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did this with my first blogging clients, a client who worked on Basecamp, and more. Just nodded my head, acted confident&#8230;and went off and quickly figured it out.</p>
<p>Most online tools are pretty intuitive, and they resemble each other, too. If you&#8217;ve used WordPress, for example, you can probably also use Blogger, or your client&#8217;s custom-coded blogging tool. If you&#8217;ve used Google Drive, Basecamp won&#8217;t be tough, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Assume you can pick it up. If you get stuck, ask your client if you could chat with their tech trainer for a few minutes, to make sure you&#8217;ve got exactly how they use this tool. Usually, they&#8217;ll be happy to do so.</p>
<h2>7. Partner with a techie</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not necessary to learn every blessed technical wrinkle yourself. And some tech stuff is complex. If a client wants you to write and code their website, just let them know you&#8217;ll be partnering with a site designer to get this project done.</p>
<p>At this point in my business, I pay webmasters a substantial sum monthly to work on projects to improve my blog and the Den. I&#8217;ve chosen to focus on writing, rather than learning these skill sets, which would take a lot longer and slow down my business&#8217;s progress.</p>
<p>Some writers hire a transcriptionist to save time &#8212; and you can hire tech people to save time, too.</p>
<h2>One thing more</h2>
<p>When you&#8217;re using tech for clients, you only have to know one more technical thing than your client does. Show them one new tech twist, and they&#8217;ll think you&#8217;re a genius! This has happened to me more than once (hilarious, no?).</p>
<p>Stop thinking you&#8217;ll need years to master some aspect of technology, and jump right into talking tech with clients.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve figured out how to run promoted post-style ads <a title="Facebook - make a Living Writing" href="https://www.facebook.com/makealivingwriting" target="_blank">on Facebook</a>, for instance, share that info. I stumbled onto a free Webinar about that recently, so I used it in my own business:</p>
<p><a href="http://usefulwritingcourses.com/courses/pitch-clinic/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4047" src="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-11-07-at-3.14.01-PM.png" alt="Freelance writers pitch clinic" width="444" height="285" /></a></p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m set to talk Facebook marketing strategy to clients. Most small business owners are shocked and amazed if you can show them something like this. Many don&#8217;t have time to delve into social media.</p>
<p>This really does work like teaching religious school: You can study a <del>Bible lesson</del> tech maneuver one week, implement it on your own blog the next week, and be impressing a client with it the week after that. See one, do one, get paid to do one.</p>
<p><em><strong>How have you learned the tech you need, writers?</strong></em> Leave a comment and tell us.</p>

<p>We all know what it feels like to read brilliant writing. It draws you in, awakens your emotions and leaves you feeling alive with personal revelations. Most of all, it changes you for the better.</p>
<p>So what happens when you read your own writing, and it doesn’t quite rise to that level?</p>
<p>Some writers will say, “I know I can do better.”</p>
<p>But too many will say, “This isn’t good enough, and never will be. I should just give up.”</p>
<p>This is the moment when self-criticism becomes unhealthy and debilitating to your career. Your writing is going nowhere because it can’t get past your toughest critic — you.</p>
<p>As a writer and new blogger, I’ve been there. I know negative thought patterns will always creep their way into my consciousness and threaten to shut me down.

<p>As a writer and new blogger, I’ve been there. I know negative thought patterns will always creep their way into my consciousness and threaten to shut me down. In order for my career to survive, I&#8217;ve developed a few techniques to help turn my harsh self-criticism into constructive learning and growth.</p>
<p><span id="more-4021"></span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Reflect on past work</h2>
<p>When I was writing my first pieces of content for my creativity blog, I felt I&#8217;d turned out a couple of gems, and quite a few lumps of coal. Nothing I&#8217;d written sounded right. My personal style wasn’t visible, and I couldn’t hear my own voice in my writing.</p>
<p>But one piece I&#8217;d written, a personal essay, made me smile. I could hear myself loud and clear in it — and could feel the passion behind my words.</p>
<p>“What’s different about this piece? What makes it so great?” I asked.</p>
<p>Answering those questions helped me learn which writing style and type of content works best with my personality and skill set.</p>
<h2>Trust in your value</h2>
<p>One affirmation always drives me forward when I’m struggling during the writing process: What I am saying — the message I am delivering — is important.</p>
<p>Some <a title="Your Les Miserables Guide to Freelance Writing Excellence" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/les-miserables-guide-freelance-writing-excellence/" target="_blank">works of art</a> are meant to be created and shared with the world. In his memoir, Stephen King likens the fiction story to a fossil waiting to be unearthed by the writer. If you trust that your story is meant to be heard, it will find its way out.</p>
<h2>Every little bit helps</h2>
<p>Brilliant writing doesn’t happen overnight. It takes years of practice and dedication. Look for the good in your work and realize that not everything you write needs to be published.</p>
<p>These days, when I write something I’m not crazy about, I simply tell myself, “This was great practice. I’m honing my writing chops.”</p>
<p>Just keep moving and <a title="How I Got Over My Author Complex and Became a Real Writer" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/real-nonfiction-writer/" target="_blank">watch your writing evolve</a> into what you always knew you were capable of.</p>
<p>Then one fine day, you can look at your work and say without hesitation, “Now, that’s some damn good writing!”</p>

<p>I hear every week from aspiring freelance writers who despise their cubicle life. You hate your boss. Working for the Man is unfilling. It's boring. Certainly not how you ever planned to spend your precious days.</p>
<p>So you're thinking about quitting to become a freelance writer. Maybe you've been <a title="Write your way out of the rat race" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/writers-bookshelf/#renegade" target="_blank">writing on the side</a> in hopes of building up your freelancing until it's time to quit. Or perhaps you've recently taken the plunge.</p>
<p>If you've been in Corporate America a long time, here's my forecast: You're in for a rocky ride.</p>
<p>There's a popular myth that if you hate being a cog in a big corporate wheel, it's a sign that you should quit your job. Your hatred of the paycheck world indicates you will be a super-successful freelance writer.</p>
<p>But in my experience mentoring thousands of writers, that ain't necessarily so. Here's why:</p>

<p>I hear every week from aspiring freelance writers who despise their cubicle life. You hate your boss. Working for the Man is unfilling. It&#8217;s boring. Certainly not how you ever planned to spend your precious days.</p>
<p>So you&#8217;re thinking about quitting to become a freelance writer. Maybe you&#8217;ve been <a title="Write your way out of the rat race" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/writers-bookshelf/#renegade" target="_blank">writing on the side</a> in hopes of building up your freelancing until it&#8217;s time to quit.

<p>There&#8217;s a popular myth that if you hate being a cog in a big corporate wheel, it&#8217;s a sign that you should quit your job. Your hatred of the paycheck world indicates you will be a super-successful freelance writer.</p>
<p>But in my experience mentoring thousands of writers, that ain&#8217;t necessarily so. Here&#8217;s why:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-3884"></span></p>
<h2>Welcome to a completely different world</h2>
<p>Freelancing is not anything like holding down a day job. You&#8217;ve been working away for years, but what you&#8217;re doing is in no way preparing you to operate a solo freelance business.</p>
<p>A typical day job works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have one small, specialized area of responsibility</li>
<li>A boss tells you what to do and by when</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re tired or sick, you can warm a chair and keep getting paid</li>
<li>Unless you&#8217;re in the marketing department, you do no marketing</li>
<li>If you weren&#8217;t in legal, you don&#8217;t negotiate contracts</li>
<li>All the big decisions are made by professional managers</li>
<li>A million little things are also handled by others</li>
<li>All the equipment and supplies you need are provided for you</li>
<li>If you need information, you ask the research department</li>
<li>Watching expenses is not your problem</li>
<li>The profitability of the business isn&#8217;t within your control, and not a big concern</li>
</ol>
<p>As a freelancer, all these things work in reverse. Because now, you&#8217;re not working for the Man. You ARE the Man:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are responsible for every aspect of the business</li>
<li>There is no boss to tell you how to prioritize your work</li>
<li>Warming a chair earns you zero dollars</li>
<li>All the marketing is your responsibility</li>
<li>Negotiating and getting contracts signed is all on you</li>
<li>You make all the big decisions, without a pro management team</li>
<li>Every little thing must be handled by you, too</li>
<li>You must purchase or obtain all needed equipment and supplies</li>
<li>If you need information, you&#8217;ll have to go find it</li>
<li>Watching expenses is critical to your financial survival</li>
<li>The profitability of the business is paramount &#8212; or you don&#8217;t eat</li>
</ol>
<p>Compare those two lists, and you can see that corporate employment leaves you lacking many vital freelancing skills.</p>
<h2>The worker-drone passivity problem</h2>
<p>What often happens to your brain in Corporate America is that your initiative-taking and leadership centers atropy. They&#8217;re never called on. You don&#8217;t come up with ideas and take action on them. It&#8217;s all spoon-fed to you.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, when the company makes some spectacular misstep, your main role is to accept it. If you aren&#8217;t enthusiastic about the merger or the new product, you&#8217;ll be sacked, right? You learn to be quiet and go with the flow.</p>
<p>This leads to big problems when you suddenly have to run your own show.</p>
<h2>Is your Google broken?</h2>
<p>Over and over, I hear from writers who <a title="How one freelance writer blew it and went broke" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/freelance-writer-who-went-broke/" target="_blank">attempted freelancing</a>&#8230;and hit a wall that stopped them cold. You can see these writers haunting the LinkedIn forums, asking basic questions that two minutes of basic Google searching could solve, or a quick LinkedIn search.</p>
<p>Questions like:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Does anyone know the email of the editor for <em>Costco Connection</em>? I can&#8217;t find it&#8230;&#8221; (It&#8217;s visible in the online edition, on the magazine&#8217;s masthead.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you help me find the marketing manager for the company I want to pitch?&#8221; (LinkedIn usually works, or checking the contact name on the company&#8217;s online press releases.)</p></blockquote>
<p>This is learned helplessness in action. If the answer is not directly in front of your face, you start asking random people to provide the answer, even if you could easily find it yourself &#8211;<em> if</em> you took a little initiative. But that&#8217;s just not in your blood, after your days behind a corporate desk.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fascinating to have writers ask me over and over for factoids they could get in under one minute from a Google search. I sometimes jokingly wonder if maybe their Google is broken, or somehow my Google is better than their Google.</p>
<p>But I know what it really is: an allergy to being a self-contained, functional entrepreneur that was learned in the belly of a corporation.</p>
<h2>What freelancing requires</h2>
<p>There are a few things that working a day job do give you that help in freelancing. The top quality, I&#8217;d say, is the ability to <a title="How I survived my client meeting from hell" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/survived-client-meeting-from-hell/" target="_blank">deal with difficult people</a>. I don&#8217;t know anyone who&#8217;s spent substantial time in Corporate America who didn&#8217;t acquire that skill!</p>
<p>If you want to write copy for big companies, it helps to have lived in that world before. You know the lingo. You don&#8217;t freak out when they bring out their wireframes and task charts and ask you to collaborate in the cloud or take five different meetings about the same project.</p>
<p>But some of the things that made it hard for you to hold a job &#8212; a dislike of following orders, for instance &#8212; will likely also hurt you as a freelancer.</p>
<p>In freelancing, you don&#8217;t just have one boss. You have many. And you have to juggle all of their demands and personalities and foibles.</p>
<p>At the same time, you have to decide your course and steer your business alone, making endless decisions about how to market, where to spend money, which clients to take, and what to charge.</p>
<h2>The winning mindset</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s funny, but many people spend years working in corporations, then start freelancing, flounder around for years&#8230;and then finally, remark to me, &#8220;I just got it &#8212; I need to think of this like a business!&#8221;</p>
<p>All that time spent in business, and yet we imagine freelance writing is a purely creative endeavor that magically exists outside the realm of commerce.</p>
<p>If you want to succeed as a freelance writer, learn to be an entrepreneur. Hang out with small-business people you know. Instead of going to writer conferences, go to conferences about how to grow your business. That&#8217;s what I did, and it made all the difference.</p>
<p>You may know how to write, but freelancing is running a business. Acquire entrepreneurial skills, and you&#8217;ll have a huge advantage over most freelance writers.</p>
