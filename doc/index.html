<p>In Prunella Smith: Worlds Within Worlds, Australian writer Tahlia Newland addresses the timely problem of authors harassing, stalking, and even physically attacking reviewers who have panned their books. But this novel isn&#8217;t a lurid melodrama. It&#8217;s a contemplative story about the creative process that&#8217;s also, amazingly, a page-turner. I put everything else aside and read it in a single afternoon.</p>
<p>Editor and author Ella Smith lives with her cat in an isolated area of the Australian bush. She has one or two close friends and goes on an occasional date, but most of the time she&#8217;s alone. That&#8217;s how she likes it. Then she begins receiving email threats from &#8220;Dita,&#8221; an irate author whose book she reviewed. She has no idea who Dita is. He uses pseudonyms online and writes under a pen name.</p>
<p>Her response is to retreat into the inner worlds that nourish her creativity. A serious Buddhist, she meditates to overcome the fear and anger triggered by Dita&#8217;s threats. She doesn&#8217;t have time for them; a deadline is approaching for a major editorial project. Besides, what can he actually do to hurt her? She soon discovers that even in the abstract world of the Internet, Dita can inflict damage to her reputation and livelihood. He highjacks her Facebook account and bad-mouths her in online forums. Her book receives a spate of one-star reviews. Editorial work dries up. The threats in his emails escalate. It become harder and harder for her to retreat to a place of safety.</p>
<p>The novel contains long passages from the fantasy novel that Ella is editing, and I become caught up in that story, just as she does. When the fantasy&#8217;s plot takes a wrong turn and she tries to persuade the author to rewrite, Newland reveals that characters from the fantasy also appear in her Lethal Inheritance series and their fate depends on Ella&#8217;s being able to change the fictional author&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the metafictional aspect of Worlds Within Worlds. Newland includes a foreword emphasizing that she is NOT Ella. She doesn&#8217;t need to explain, at least not to me.</p>
<p>The novel has some weaknesses. Long passages describe the process of meditation. I found them interesting (although a bit didactic at times), but some readers may feel they slow the story. The plot culminates in a revelation that I figure out very early, but Newland covers her foreshadowing enough to make me wonder if I&#8217;m wrong.</p>
<p>Writers will appreciate Worlds Within Worlds for its exploration of the creative process. Intelligent readers will enjoy the memorable characters, the suspense, and the intricacies of Ella&#8217;s interlocking worlds.</p>

<p><em>Off the Beaten Track</em> is a memoir of long time travel writer Frank Kusy, author of the AIA Seal of Excellence winner <em>Rupee Millionaire</em>. Kusy’s experience as a writer shows in the fluid, vibrant prose he uses to describe his travels in Asia in the seventies. This is an engaging story full of anecdotes that have you smiling and shaking your head at the antics of the young Kusy.</p>
<p>The difficulty in memoir writing is to find a thread that unifies the story in the way that the plot does in fiction. Generally, real life isn’t as dramatic as fiction, and in unskilled hands, it’s easy to lose a reader if the account of a person’s life wanders aimlessly. This would be particularly easy to do in a travel memoir, but Kusy has worked skilfully with his material and used the thread of his efforts to both secure and avoid getting a wife in the same way that a fiction writer would use a plot. Though the various anecdotes are interesting in themselves, without this emphasis, they would not provide such a satisfying whole. We want to read to the end to see how young Frank’s bumbling efforts at romance turn out. Frank is an endearing character and his perspective on the world and efforts to live as a Buddhist add another layer of interest to the memoir.</p>
<p>The other theme, as the title suggests, is his desire to get off the beaten track, and the events that thwart his attempts to really experience Asia without a whiff of tourists provide further interest beyond a mere account of his travels. Though not as dramatic as Rupee Millionaires, it’s still a great read, especially for anyone interested in travel in Asia. Highly recommended.</p>
<p>The editing is excellent. My only misgiving was that I would have liked the author to have gone more deeply into some aspects of his journey; for example, the ceremony when the Joju Gohonzon was enshrined in the main temple in Jakarta. No doubt the author has his reasons for staying clear of it, but I felt it was a missed opportunity to go deeper into the culture.</p>
<p>All up Kusy is a very talented memoir writer and this book should be enjoyed by a wide variety of people.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Sicilian Defence is a collection of short stories based on characters who live in or around Sicily. The stories are varied in topic, but all written in a very literary style.  Each story is independent of the others, making this an easy book to pick up, read for a bit and feel satisfied that you have read a good story.</p>
<p>The voice is decidedly European, but interesting. The observations and characters are so real, so true to life that they’re unsettling. The endings are enigmatic but they stay with the reader in their possibilities. I am enthralled by these stories. They are of a style and quality that should do the same for many readers in many parts of the world. Overall, this is a well written collection with varied stories. However, some may find the pace of the stories a little too slow.</p>

<p>Both emerging and established writers from Europe, the USA, Australia and New Zealand present a peek into the spectacular moments everyday life holds, but with a twist.</p>
<p>The collection opens with a bang with a story by Tahlia Newland. Intriguing to the last paragraph, I was surprised to find it was an excerpt from her newest project. It sits perfectly as a short story and a wonderful teaser into what looks to be an exciting premise.</p>
<p>Each story has an incredible depth and texture to them, that, although is specific to its own style, melds beautifully as a collection. The human condition is explored where the reader is challenged to reassess their perspectives on stereotypes and events. Post apocalyptic tales sit comfortably with personalised stories like fragmented memories; separate, but with a golden thread holding them together. Heart-wrenching, whimsical, tear-jerking and lighthearted there is a story to suit all moods and readers tastes.</p>
<p>It is difficult to chose a favourite story, with a wrestling loving gran meeting her idol, to emotional trials of marriages breaking apart or forming, futuristic zombies and maids from a gentler time.</p>
<p>Authors are recognised in their own right with multiple honours and prizes and although the anthology is an eclectic mixture of genre, reading one after the other only highlights the complexity and intrigue each story brings.</p>
<p>A great book to stash into someones Christmas stocking for some fireside holiday reading, Awesome Allshorts is set to be a winner in your readers life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/delirium-review-an-ambitious-book/"><img width="890" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Delerium-890x400.jpg" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="Delerium" /></a><p><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Delerium.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-10397 aligncenter" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Delerium-200x300.jpg" alt="Delerium" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>There are a lot of voices to listen to in <em>Delirium</em>, and they’re all talking about one thing: a lost manuscript.</p>
<p>The search begins with the source, the poet Arthur Rimbaud, the manuscript’s author. We hear first the voices of Rimbaud, his lover Paul Verlaine, and Verlaine’s wife, Mathilde, giving us a glimpse of the world as it was then, in the late 19th century. Other voices add to the story as we follow the manuscript through the 20th century and into the 21st.</p>
<p>Knitting the story together is the central narrative of Andrea Mann, who, in 2004, goes in search of Rimbaud’s lost poem, <em>La Chasse Spirituelle</em>. Andrea’s meeting with a young man at Rimbaud’s grave starts her on a journey that may or may not connect her with a manuscript that, if genuine, would be worth a great deal of money. It’s not the money, though, that intrigues Andrea. We sense that the lost poem represents something else.</p>
<p>The intertwining threads of the history of the manuscript—caught up with its various custodians in the senseless tragedy of World War I, the cruel barbarity of World War II, and the lives, hopes, and dreams of ordinary people—I found fascinating. Andrea Mann’s story I found less so. Perhaps because part of her search involves knowing, or not knowing, what is real and what is not, I was never sure what was real and what was not. While that may have been a conscious choice by the author, it kept me too cautious, unwilling to enter fully into Andrea’s story. As in real life, if I believe I’m being misled, I will stay a bit removed from a situation. That remove also made me too critical—even judgmental—of Andrea. I never really got a sense of who she was; I only saw her jerked around by the manipulations of others.</p>
<p><em>Delirium</em> is an ambitious book. I believe the author did not quite achieve her ambition in telling Andrea’s story, but it was a worthy attempt. I’m still mulling over many of the issues she raised and questions she never answered fully. And I’ve also started reading fin de siecle French poetry.</p>
<p>I received this free of charge in return for an honest review on behalf of the Awesome Indies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/worlds-within-worlds-review-a-very-topical-book/"><img width="890" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB-890x400.jpg" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="Worlds_Final-WEB" /></a><p><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-10620 aligncenter" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB-198x300.jpg" alt="Worlds_Final-WEB" width="198" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>This is a very topical book, a very well written one too. Thirty something Ella Smith lives in a remote log cabin in the Australian bush, cut off from most of humanity but connected through her mind and imagination (and her internet) to a multitude of worlds: at times she is a writer/editor in the real world, at others she is a wise old Yogi in the prelude to the 1959 Chinese invasion of Tibet, or Kelee, the fictional warrior princess with whom she comes to identify strongly through the book she is editing. Not to mention her alter ego as Electra, an ‘after dark’ dancer in a local strip joint. The topicality of the book comes when Ella responds to a request of an ‘honest’ review from an arrogant (and unbalanced) author on his new novel and gives him just that… a two-star review on a social media website (Amazon) which he deeply resents. At this point, we enter Stephen King territory – the demented author Dita shouting “Take it down!” much as the main protagonist of King’s ‘Thinner’ shouts ‘Take it off!’ to the gypsy who has laid a curse him. When she doesn’t, the author turns cyber troll and begins invading her virtual world with increasingly nasty abuse and threats, along with one-star reviewing her own recently published book. As the bullying author penetrates even her dream world (he’s a dark, human shaped blob in a hoodie!) her other identities as Kelee, Electra and the Yogi also run into crisis, and she struggles, through her Buddhist practice, to elevate her mind above the worldly concern of being unliked by 20 Facebook friends overnight. ‘Sometimes it’s hard being a Buddhist,’ she observes when not just one but two stalkers get on her case – the fight is on, in her own mind, to see all obstacles as opportunities, to see Dita, The Creep and even the evil Beak as fuel to fire her own journey to enlightenment. This is riveting stuff, part magical realism dreamscape, part taut psychological thriller, and I was literally on the edge of my seat when the final twist – and what a twist it is – came around. Phew, what a ride!<br />
I received a copy of this book in exchange for an ‘honest’ review of my own. Well done, Ms Newland, I can honestly say this is the best book have read this year.<br />
Make sure it goes on your list of great new books to read.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/short-story-the-senior-school-days-of-arthur-callum-1915-1917-part-3/"><img width="688" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Arthur-callum-688x400.png" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="Picture of Arthur Callum and his sister, Winnifred, circa 1905" /></a><p>We had grand field days with the O.T.C. Two platoons would be marched some few miles away to protect, say, a farm. The other two platoons would attack in an attempt to “take the objective”. We were provided with a dozen rounds of “blank” ammunition. We smaller boys realised and seized the opportunity this provided. Skilfully, we plugged the top of our barrels with mud. Then at the appropriate moment, when espying a sergeant, we took careful aim and fired! The usual result was “six of the best!” Fair enough.</p>
<p>Of course we worked too. The school curriculum was very comprehensive for those far off days based as it was on “Maths”, Geography, History, Divinity, French and Latin. I was usually “top” in Maths- thanks to my sister who, years before, had managed to explain and get into my rather thick head, the intricacies of simple fractions. She managed this with apples and a knife, cutting them into physical sections. Knowledge, my Prep School masters had tried to instil by screaming at me. (‘Prep’, officially preparatory, schools are the primer institutions for the public schools. Both of these are fee paying schools independent of the State school system). As it happened Maths was the subject taught by my later Housemaster, which many of us were so anxious to please. One is encouraged to work harder for fine and honourable men.</p>
<p>One day he was taking Maths and did a rather complicated sum on the blackboard, explaining a problem previously set for us. “Has anyone got this correct?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir,” answered a boy, “I have”. His paper was examined revealing that he had cheated by altering a figure.</p>
<p>“Cheating?” said my Housemaster.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir.”</p>
<p>Without a word more, the ‘Old Bird’, as we affectionately called our Housemaster, left the classroom and, a few minutes later returned with his ‘bargepole’, his cane, and there and then gave the offender the inevitable ‘six’. Some two weeks later, much the same thing happened. The Old Bird set a problem; we did it as best we could. He in turn did it on the blackboard. His final figure differed from mine. I hastily altered my figure. “Has a boy obtained this result?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir.” I said. Then our teacher noticed he had made an error, then altering his total, which, to my consternation agreed with my original result. He looked at my paper.</p>
<p>“Cheating?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir.” He did not retire to get his bargepole but carried on with the lesson. I thought, being in his house, he would call me to his study at evening prep. The evening came, I was not called. The next day I passed him in the Cloisters, just before breakfast time. He ignored me completely. I was totally ignored for the whole day and so went to his study in the evening and knocked on his door. “Come in”, said his sing-song voice. I entered. “Get out”, he said. I don’t think I have ever felt so low in all of my subsequent life. Suffice it to say that I could stand it no longer, so I went to his study again. I was bid to enter. “What do you want?” he said.</p>
<p>“ Sir, you caught me cheating two days ago and I cannot stand being ignored.” He realised I was very upset.</p>
<p>“You know”, he said, “you’ve no need to cheat, but I think I know why you did. Now you want me to give you six and thus pay your debt don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not going to. Instead I want you to promise never to cheat again- now shake hands.” He gave me a chocolate. I never did cheat from that moment. How he knew our characters. I now began to understand what Public School education was all about.</p>
<p>I didn’t shine at games, although I was in the School Shooting VIII, pretty good at swimming, and quite useful with the ‘gloves’. Now, during our ‘long runs’ I was getting a severe searing pain in my lower abdomen- possibly the start of an appendicitis which blew up years later, bursting and leading to serious complications that were to last me, I can now be certain, for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Now came winter term of 1917. It was three weeks before ‘Break-up’ for Christmas. One Sunday the Head came into Hall and called for me to attend his study immediately. I naturally wondered what I had done. When I arrived the Head said to me, “Sit down, my boy, have a chocolate”. I sensed what was coming then, for my dear father had been ill for some time. “I want you to go to your dorm and pack, you’re father isn’t very well and has asked that I send you home.” He put his hand on my shoulder- that was enough. I burst into tears.</p>
<p>“Is he . . .” I asked.</p>
<p>“No no,” said the Head, “but he is very ill. A car will be ready for you in an hour”. Then, after a pause he added, ”God be with you.” I returned to pack- all my dormitory friends waiting to help me. My dear Housemaster came up and I was escorted to the Cloisters where the school car, an old “T” Ford, was waiting for me. I left my school, looking through the rear window of that car, to see the Old Bird and my friends waving me away. I was very sad at this moment, but deeply grateful for their kindnesses.</p>
<p>My dear father died some four weeks later.</p>
<p>The Head wrote what I can describe as a wonderful letter to my mother, offering a school exhibition in my favour to help with the school fees. But, alas, family circumstances did not permit acceptance.</p>
<p>How grateful I am for my time at the School, to my Head and Housemaster- to all my alma mater. They were happy, happy days. Tough though life in boarding schools was in those days they only reflected tough life in general. Occasional upset aside, I really was extremely happy there and immensely respected most of my then betters. So how should this essay end?</p>
<p>How about, Arthur Callum lived happy school days, whilst those born just before him died on the Somme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>‘The barrier between the worlds shatters like the window. The beast is loose. My nightmare has become real. The guy has totally lost it. If he finds us here, we could die. No, I don’t doubt it; we will die.’</em></p>
<p>Author and editor Prunella Smith inhabits a multilayered reality. Physically, she lives in the Australian bush with her crazy cat Merlin. In her work world, she edits the love story of Kelee, a Magan Lord’s daughter, and in the cyber-world of social media, she’s subjected to slanderous attacks by a disgruntled author. To complicate matters further she sees things through the eyes of a Tibetan Yogi, has strange dreams and relives old memories.</p>
<p>Separate worlds, interconnected and complementary, but can they help when Prunella becomes victim to a real life stalker and her sanity is threatened?</p>
<p><em>Worlds Within Worlds</em> has a unique perspective on the nature of creativity. Its touch is light, its humour distinctive but it reaches deep into the nature of human experience.</p>
<h2>What readers are saying.</h2>
<p>“This is riveting stuff, part magical realism dreamscape, part taut psychological thriller, and I was literally on the edge of my seat when the final twist—and what a twist it is—came around. Phew, what a ride! I can honestly say it is the best book I have read this year.” Frank Kusy, author of Rupee Millionaires.</p>
<p>“Worlds Within Worlds tackles the problem of identity in the age of technological anonymity. Ella Smith is an independent author and editor whose online life crashes into reality with disturbing implications. The book questions how much of one&#8217;s true self can &#8211; and should &#8211; be broadcast to the world.</p>
<p>This book will make you think. Considering the deluge of new works streaming from authors these days, that may be the highest praise a novel can receive.” Amy Spahn, editor.</p>
<p>“An appealing novel about a woman who suffers from online stalking after writing a book review. It’s a well-paced story and is a fascinating insight into the mind of someone using meditative techniques to deal with stress.” Kevin Berry, Awesome Indies reviews.</p>
<p>Make sure it goes on your list of great new books to read.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/short-story-the-senior-school-days-of-arthur-callum-1915-1917-part-2/"><img width="688" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Arthur-callum-688x400.png" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="Picture of Arthur Callum and his sister, Winnifred, circa 1905" /></a><p>War was a constant background then. Senior School, some two hundred boys, dined together in the Hall; if dining it could be called. Some mornings, too many alas, after breakfast, the Head had a dreadful ritual to perform. In cap and gown he would march up to the top table, turn to face us all, and say, “Let us stand in loving memory, of the following old boys who have given their lives for their Country. “ He would read the casualty list and, with tears rolling down his face, retire from the Hall midst silence befitting so sad a moment. Time after time this sad ceremony! We youngsters were left stunned, but with a peculiar feeling of pride and love for those who had fallen, for our School, our Country and, perhaps above all, our Head. He was a wonderful man, a Gentleman.</p>
<p>One’s first term at a Public School was grim to say the least. It did teach us to ‘take it’ like a man. Tough though it was, the rule was generally fair. I cannot remember a single boy ‘running-away’ in his first term. As was normal in most schools there were some tough traditions. For us, there was that awful ‘New Boys Concert’. Each dorm assembled in its own common room and all new boys had to perform; either sing, act, dance, recite or something. Whatever any individual did, however good, he would finish amid shouts of “horrible”, “beastly”, “caddish” etc. etc., augmented with showers of books hurled at him. My turn came. I said I couldn’t do anything but offered to fight anyone present. I think this was a crass reaction to home sickness. “Like that, is it?” said someone. “Well, you’ve asked for it. Go into the next room. You will see a hen in a cage. Let it free into the Quad.”</p>
<p>I could hardly refuse. Little did I know that this bird was a price specimen, brought especially by our house prefect and intended as a present to the School Farmer. I went to the next room, released the hen and returned to our common room. About two minutes later, the door burst open and a senior prefect, very red faced, shouted, “Who let my hen go?” I admitted doing so. “Follow me”, he said and took me to his study. “Bend over”, I got three of the best. “But for the fact that you are a beastly little new boy, I’d give you six.” Three was enough! My shine of newness was being rubbed off.</p>
<p>Food was grim in those days. We had enough bread and a bit of butter, &#8216;grease&#8217;, but only one egg a week. But for our tuckboxes, I cannot think how we would have survived. But there was a war and this we knew only too well. Nobody really grumbled. Long route marches in the O.T.C. and school runs (once a week in the winter and spring terms over a distance of no less than 6 miles), made us very hungry. Bread and the inevitable plum jam, and potatoes soon filled our tummies. Anyway there was nothing else!</p>
<p>We had a lot of Chapel- a bit too much for me. We went twice a day, with two long services on Sundays. The Wednesday Communion was always very well attended, because any boy attending this extra service was excused Wednesday ‘prep’. This abbreviated word, was short for preparation, being the equivalent of homework for day school children.</p>
<p>Parents were permitted to visit us during term. One visit was welcome, but a second was rather frowned upon. We had to get a pass from the Housemaster, if we wished to meet our parents at the Station, which was out of bounds. And of course, except on Sundays, we had to get written permission to be excused class. Having made ourselves presentable we reported to the Housemaster. He having inspected us, produced the necessary pass, and wished us a happy day, or, rather afternoon. Off we went to the Station, as fast as our little legs would carry us. Happy indeed were those brief days; to see our parents again, and to enjoy a few hours of freedom, including a ‘bumper’ tea of ‘x’ buttered buns and cakes. Time flew by. Then back to school- to the Housemaster, “Please, Sir, thank you, Sir.”</p>
<p>Our parents always left us with parcels of food for our tuckboxes, which we would share with our immediate friends.</p>
<p>I remember our O.T.C. – in accordance with War Office instructions, I believe, provided a guard each night for the School Gates. This was, of course, to train us for “things to come” in France! It was very formal. Each night, a corporal and four other ranks formed the Guard, thus providing a total of 35 ‘men’ per week. We were given specific instructions not to admit anyone without the password. One night, or rather one morning, at perhaps 01:30 hours, our French master, who was in fact, French, had been up to London and returned on the last train. He had to walk to the school and, on arriving at the Gates, was duly challenged. “Halt, who goes there?” cried a sentry.</p>
<p>“Friend” was the reply.</p>
<p>“Advance friend and give the password.” The dear old chap couldn’t remember it, so we arrested him and kept him in the Guard Room all night!</p>
<p>The next day the Head called an enquiry. “You boys knew very well that Mr. ‘X’ did not present a security risk, so why did you arrest him?”</p>
<p>“It was our duty, Sir, as he did not give the password.”</p>
<p>The Head turned away; I’m sure he was grinning. The French master, perhaps glad that he hadn’t got treatment that we may well have metered out to the Bosch, gave us a large pot of jam.</p>
<p>On another occasion, in Hall, the Head came in and announced, “I wish to see all members of the School Guard in the Armoury, immediately after breakfast.” We paraded in single file, some 35 ‘men’. The Head came in. “I have reason to believe that certain members of the Guard have been smoking wretched cigarettes whilst on duty- all those who have offended will take one step forward.” All thirty five took that pace forward immediately. The Head’s cheeks reddened. He looked as proud as taken aback. There followed a long pause, and then he said, “Please do not smoke again”, and marched out. We didn’t smoke again, at least not during duty. We were “honour bound”, and in those days that was enough. In fact, of the thirty-five, possibly as few as a dozen had smoked.</p>
