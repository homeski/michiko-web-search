				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently found myself in the &#8220;writing&#8221; subreddit, offering my two cents in the discussion. One of the questions that seemed to ring a bell with a few writers was, “<em>Why can’t I bring myself to edit?”</em> Writing seemed to be the easy part. Editing your book? Not so much.</p>
<p>Here at <a title="CompletelyNovel" href="http://completelynovel.com/" target="_blank">CompletelyNovel</a>, we find that editing makes all the difference when publishing a book. It’s what puts your work in the same league as the books on your bookshelf. If you dread editing, it can help to think of it in the same way as you do your writing. Both writing and editing are as much about creativity as they are about discipline and planning.</p>
<p>Below are some of the top tips I’ve picked up to manage and, dare I say it, even make editing enjoyable!</p>
<h2>1. Set Yourself Targets for Writing and Editing Your Book</h2>
<p>Rather than steaming straight into editing, spend some time planning. <a title="The Ridiculously Surefire Way to Write the Perfect Novel" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2008/07/making-of-perfect-novel.html" target="_blank">Take lessons from your writing routine</a>.</p>
<p>Do you prefer to write in the morning, or in the evening?</p>
<p>Do you need solitude, or can you freely scribble away in a noisy café?</p>
<p>You may set yourself a word limit to reach each day. Setting achievable goals keep you motivated to put pen to paper. A thousand words you’re not proud of is better than no words at all, after all.</p>
<p>You can use the same ideas to plan your editing. Again, consider the way you write.</p>
<p>Do you find that you run out of steam quickly? Then you might find it useful to schedule in an editing day after several days of writing.</p>
<p>Or maybe you prefer to write the whole thing first and edit after? That’s okay, just remember to break your editing into achievable goals like you did your writing. Editing a thousand words a day sounds much more doable than editing the entire novel.</p>
<h2>2. Understand Editing Your Book Comes in Different Forms</h2>
<p>There are three well-known stages of editing:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1.</strong> Structural.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2.</strong> Copyediting.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3.</strong> Proofreading.</p>
<p>Each is equally important, and they work best in that order.</p>
<h3>Structural Editing</h3>
<p>Our <a title="Get Your Book Fit" href="https://www.udemy.com/get-your-book-fit/?couponCode=GYBF15" target="_blank">Get Your Book Fit</a> sums up structural editing really well. Structural editing focuses on the basic elements of storytelling, things such as narrative drive, <a title="5 Ways to Pace Your Story" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2009/07/5-ways-to-pace-your-story.html" target="_blank">pacing</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EJX08QA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00EJX08QA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20" target="_blank">structure</a>, and <a title="3 Ways to Make Your POVs Equally Interesting" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/03/3-ways-to-make-your-povs-equally.html" target="_blank">point of view</a>.</p>
<h3>Copyediting</h3>
<p>Copyediting on the other hand, is about polishing the surface: correcting mistakes in <a title="Most Common Writing Mistakes: 10 Stylistic Mistakes Sabotaging Your Story" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2011/08/most-common-mistakes-series-10.html" target="_blank">usage</a>, continuity, <a title="Are You Guilty of These 8 Common Grammar Mistakes?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2011/02/guilty-8-common-grammar-mistakes.html" target="_blank">grammar</a>, and style.</p>
<h3>Proofreading</h3>
<p>Proofreading is the very last stage of editing&#8211;<a title="Never Miss a Typo Again" href="http://authorculture.blogspot.com/2010/02/never-miss-typo-again.html" target="_blank">identifying and correcting all the remaining errors</a>. There’s no use spending months correcting typos only to realize you need to rewrite half the book for it to make sense structurally, after all!</p>
<h2>3. Edit With Fresh Perspective</h2>
<p>Don’t underestimate the importance of giving your mind a rest between writing and editing. Stephen King famously leaves six weeks between writing and editing his manuscript. Again, how much time you need depends on how you work. Some writers take a few days and some take a few weeks.</p>
<h2>4. Improve Your Line Editing</h2>
<p>This can be a bit time consuming, but rest assured it is time well invested. Separate your sentences and think about whether each of them makes sense both on its own and within a wider context. Look closely at <a title="5 Key Ways to Choose the Right Word (Without a Thesaurus!)" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/11/5-key-ways-to-choose-the-right-word.html" target="_blank">your choice of words</a> and get rid of any phrases or words that are unnecessary or cliché.</p>
<p>I’ve found line editing is easier on a computer. Isolate every sentence on a separate line and use double spacing so you can clearly see the length and pacing of each sentence. Read the sentence out loud to discover how it flows and whether any words are jarring.</p>
<h2>5. Print Your Manuscript</h2>
<p>No, I’m not going to tell you off for preferring screen to paper, but printing a draft of your novel can be a useful process for spotting further mistakes. Words look different on a printed page. Plus, it’s nice to give your eyes a break. Shut down the computer, do some eye yoga (yes, really), and embrace that red pen as your best friend.</p>
<p>Remember, no book was ever published without editing. Sit back, unleash the red pen, cram your mouth full of cake, and enjoy yourself. Your book will be all the better for it!</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: What is your greatest challenge in editing your book?</strong></h3>

<p>I received one of these for my birthday this year, and I <em>love </em>it. It props up your book, magazine, or tablet to allow for a hands-free reading experience. Works on even the largest of books, and page turning is as easy and pushing down the clear plate.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the thing about a powerful theme. It&#8217;s not black and white. It&#8217;s not the moral of the story. It&#8217;s not an answer&#8211;it&#8217;s a question. And here&#8217;s the thing about questions: they very often have more than one answer.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re writing a story that asks a simple little question like, &#8220;Is lying bad?&#8221; That seems pretty black and white, yeah? But what about when the Mafia hitman walks up to your door and asks if your debt-ridden old man is home? He&#8217;s in the living room hiding under the coffee table, hyperventilating. But you look Mr. Hitman in the eye and swear up and down that Dad moved to Cali. Was that down-and-dirty lie a bad thing?</p>
<p>Truth isn&#8217;t subjective, but our individual takes on it are and its applicability in varying situations definitely is. As the Chinese proverb says,</p>
<blockquote><p>There are three truths. My truth, your truth, and the truth.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re ever going to write a compelling theme (and, by extension, a compelling story), this is the <em>one</em> principle of storytelling you have to realize. You can&#8217;t present readers with <em>your</em> truth straight up and <a title="How to Send a Message in Your Story… Without Preaching" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/05/message-in-your-story.html" target="_blank">expect them to not feel preached at</a>&#8211;much less swallow it for themselves.</p>
<h2>The Idea of Theme Makes Some Authors Uncomfortable&#8211;This Is Why</h2>
<p>Within some writing circles, theme has something of a bad name. Writers wrinkle their noses at the word, as if it&#8217;s kind of smelly. Theme is <em>preachy</em>. Theme is what Aesop&#8217;s fables give us. Theme is about evangelizing readers to a specific viewpoint&#8211;and readers <em>hate</em> that.</p>
<p>And yet writers are also told (like I&#8217;ve been telling you these last few weeks) that <a title="Don’t Know Your Story’s Theme? Take a Look at Your Character’s Arc" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/11/storys-theme.html" target="_blank">a powerful theme is crucial to a successful story</a>. So&#8217;s how that work?</p>
<p>The key, of course, is the word &#8220;powerful.&#8221; We only get a powerful theme when we understand that preaching actually weakens theme. Claiming a rock-solid viewpoint and screaming it in the readers&#8217; faces <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> equal a powerful theme. It&#8217;s very unmoveableness is what weakens it. Theme isn&#8217;t the brittle rock in the middle of the river: it&#8217;s the water that keeps on moving, always searching.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/FOLLOW.png"><img class=" wp-image-7771 aligncenter" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/FOLLOW.png" alt="Be water, my friend. Bruce Lee Quote" width="366" height="366" /></a></p>
<p>But then that sounds kinda wishy-washy, doesn&#8217;t it? How do you present a solid theme <em>without</em> standing behind your moral viewpoint 100%?</p>
<h2>Point and Counterpoint: Convince Readers of Your Theme by <em>Not</em> Convincing Them</h2>
<p>If your purpose of writing a novel is to convince readers of <em>your</em> truth, then you&#8217;re probably working in the wrong medium. Better buy a podium or a pulpit (or a blog!). But if you&#8217;re interested in <em>sharing</em> your truth and raising interesting questions about it, then you&#8217;re in the right place.</p>
<p>Theme is about exploration. But you can&#8217;t explore unless you&#8217;re willing to step out of the tour bus and visit some dark places. In other words, you have to be willing to look at the exact opposite of your theme&#8217;s posited truth and explore it just as earnestly and honestly as if you believed it. For every point you raise to support the thematic premise you&#8217;ve chosen, you&#8217;ll have to raise an equally honest and probing counterpoint. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y26XXA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002Y26XXA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=4Y43IRBIMWA3YURZ" target="_blank"><em>Dramatica</em></a>, <span class="a-size-small a-color-secondary">Melanie Anne Phillips and </span><span class="a-size-small a-color-secondary">Chris Huntley explain:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y26XXA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002Y26XXA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=N47R7WSRWHT42FXZ" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-7770 size-medium" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Dramatica-Melanie-Anne-Phillips-Chris-Huntley-210x300.jpg" alt="Dramatica Melanie Anne Phillips Chris Huntley" width="210" height="300" /></a>Both Issue and counterpoint must be played against one another over the course of the story if the author is to make a case that one is better than the other.</p></blockquote>
<p>Favoritism has no place in a powerful theme. Why? Because your readers will sniff it out in a second and instinctively discount your truth a little bit, both because you&#8217;re obviously prejudiced in presenting it and because they don&#8217;t appreciate your attempts to manipulate them. Robert McKee, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042FZVOY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0042FZVOY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=XW4CFZRWD2GIRJGY" target="_blank"><em>Story</em></a>, hammers it home:</p>
<blockquote><p>In creating the dimensions of your story’s [thematic] “argument,” take great care to build the power of both sides. Compose the scenes and sequences that contradict your final statement with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it. If your [story] ends on the Counter-Idea, such as “Crime pays because…,” then amplify the sequences that lead the audience to feel justice will win out. If your [story] ends on the Idea, such as “Justice triumphs because…,” then enhance the sequences expressing “Crime pays and pays big.” In other words, do not slant your “argument.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Your Powerful Theme Will Arise From Your Ability to See Both Sides</h2>
<p>Some stories will come to you complete with a strong thematic idea. The whole story is <em>about</em> why lying is bad. Your passion about this truth is why you&#8217;re writing this story in the first place. As a result, the idea that you have to explore why lying might <em>not</em> be so bad turns your stomach. McKee again:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042FZVOY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0042FZVOY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=XW4CFZRWD2GIRJGY" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-7172 size-medium" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/robert-mckee-story-200x300.jpg" alt="Story by Robert McKee" width="200" height="300" /></a>As a story develops, you must willingly entertain opposite, even repugnant ideas. The finest writers have dialectical, flexible minds that easily shift points of view. They see the positive, the negative, and all shades of irony, seeking the truth of these views honestly and convincingly. This omniscience forces them to become even more creative, more imaginative, and more insightful.</p></blockquote>
<p>I like to say that if you&#8217;re not <a title="Why You Should Be Writing Scared" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2009/10/why-you-should-be-writing-scared-2.html" target="_blank">writing scared</a>, you&#8217;re not realizing your story&#8217;s full potential&#8211;and this is nowhere more true than of theme. Authors can&#8217;t be complacent. If you&#8217;re unwilling to explore the dark sides of the truths you profess to believe, then you may want to question how strongly you actually believe them. If a theme is true, then its truth will be able to stand stalwartly under even the strongest scrutiny. Even better, it will emerge all the stronger in both your own mind and that of your readers.</p>
<p>Consider every possible objection even the most virulent readers might raise to your thematic premise. Every one of these objections needs to be raised by your characters&#8211;and not just the &#8220;bad&#8221; characters, but the protagonist himself. Take your protagonist down the dark side of your theme and see what you find. Be brutal. Be honest. You, your characters, and your readers will all emerge on the other side having gained more than mere entertainment. For the rest of your lives, you&#8217;ll all carry the things you&#8217;ve learned about this powerful theme.</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: How have you presented a powerful theme by also honestly demonstrating its flip side?</strong></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>He saunters through the fog with a black cape flapping about his heels, shoulders back, chin tucked so he can fix you with a sinister glare. When his eyes catch yours, you can’t help but shudder at the complete lack of compassion or humanity in his gaze. His chuckle sets your skin crawling, and your brain sends panicked signals to your limbs: run, run, run.</em></p>
<p>But something holds you back. A tickle at the back of your mind won’t let you quite believe. Haven’t you met this fellow before—at least a dozen times? And aren’t black capes and maniacal laughs a little passé? Does this embodiment of senseless, delighted evil represent dimensional antagonists&#8211;or will it be nothing more than a host of clichéd villains?</p>
<h2>Dimensional Antagonists&#8211;or Melodramatic Clowns?</h2>
<p>Sometimes those villains we grew up with—the ones who twirled their curly mustaches, smiled “evilly” to show off a gold tooth, or wore black cowboy hats—like to worm their way out of our memories and crawl onto the page to take up residence in our stories.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Snidely-Whiplash-Tying-Nell-to-the-Railroad-Tracks-in-Dudley-Do-Right1.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7787" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Snidely-Whiplash-Tying-Nell-to-the-Railroad-Tracks-in-Dudley-Do-Right1.jpg" alt="Snidely Whiplash Tying Nell to the Railroad Tracks in Dudley Do-Right" width="434" height="296" /></a></p>
<p>But when that happens, we run the risk of creating a robotic villain who exists solely to resist the hero&#8211;or, worse, as some sort of twisted villainous clown whose ineptitude provides nearly as much comic relief as opposition.</p>
<h2>3 Tips for Three-Dimensional Antagonists</h2>
<p>I think it’s fair to assume y’all want to create well-rounded three-dimensional antagonists—instead of cartoon cutouts of villains. Here are a few tips:</p>
<h3>1. Stop Using the Word &#8220;Villain&#8221;</h3>
<p>I know it’s hard <em>not </em>to think to think of our antagonists as villains. <a title="The Moral Villain – and a Giveaway!" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/12/moral-villain-giveaway.html" target="_blank">It’s hard <em>not</em> to paint a portrait in black ink without a shred of light to offer contrast</a>. It’s easy to think of excuses for why we <em>should</em> call them villains. After all, don’t they behave like a downright, black-hearted bad guy all the time, and isn’t the author <em>supposed </em>to be on the protagonist’s side?</p>
<p>But then this quote comes to mind:</p>
<blockquote><p>Every villain is a hero in his own mind.&#8211;Tom Hiddleston</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Loki-Riding-Chitauri-Avengers-Climax-Tom-Hiddleston.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7788" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Loki-Riding-Chitauri-Avengers-Climax-Tom-Hiddleston.jpg" alt="Loki Riding Chitauri Avengers Climax Tom Hiddleston" width="463" height="260" /></a></p>
<p>Which brings us to tip number two.</p>
<h3>2. Discover Why Your “Villain” Thinks He Is the Hero</h3>
<p>He does. Honestly. Fervently. Devoutly. Your antagonist believes he is in the right and the hero is in the wrong, and nothing is going to stop him from achieving his goal. (He does have a goal <em>other</em> than stopping the hero, right?)</p>
<p>Once you discover why your antagonist thinks he should be the protagonist, you will <a title="Why Your Character’s Motive Matters" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2010/07/why-your-characters-motive-matters.html" target="_blank">understand his motives</a> for acting the way he does, and perhaps even stumble across some decisions that you never would have expected him to make otherwise.</p>
<h3>3. The Villain Is in the Details</h3>
<p>When I first started writing my fantasy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NG5IEBS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00NG5IEBS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=U22MYPRXP6LYLVPZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Orphan’s Song</em></a>, I plugged in your typical baddie to serve as my main antagonist. Carhartan was harsh, cold, and deadly, and oh didn’t you just love to hate him! But as I dug further into my own revisions, I started playing with his character a little bit more. Added a hint of the tragic, a need for success, a tinge of honor (albeit twisted and misguided).</p>
<p>But he still felt just a tad stiff.</p>
<p>It bothered me to no end.</p>
<p>Until I started revising a scene later in the book where he’s sitting on a hummock of grass in the middle of the wilderness, ragged and travel-stained. An image instantly popped into my head: Aragorn the Ranger as he appears in the movie version of <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Viggo-Mortensen-Aragorn-Pipe.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7793 aligncenter" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Viggo-Mortensen-Aragorn-Pipe.jpg" alt="Viggo Mortensen Aragorn Pipe" width="461" height="262" /></a></p>
<p>No! That wasn’t what I wanted. Carhartan was my <em>villain</em>. Aragorn the Ranger is a very awesome <em>hero</em>. But I followed my gut instinct, bit the bullet, and plopped a pipe into Carhartan’s hand.</p>
<p>Such a tiny, seemingly inconsequential detail, but it instantly humanized Carhartan in my mind. I went back and inserted the pipe into key scenes, and it added the level of reality to Carhartan that had been missing.</p>
<p>As I thought about antagonists and those little details that make them human, another one that sprang to mind was Barbossa from <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl</em> and the apple that he so wanted to eat and enjoy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Barbossa-Apple-Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-Black-Pearl.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7794" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Barbossa-Apple-Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-Black-Pearl.jpg" alt="Barbossa Apple Pirates of the Caribbean Black Pearl" width="383" height="292" /></a></p>
<p>Even in the midst of all his reprehensible actions, you can’t help catching sight of that apple and feeling sorry for him—if only for a moment.</p>
<h2>Humanize Your Antagonist</h2>
<p>When you round it up and add it together, these three tips all aim toward the same thing: humanizing your antagonist. Once you plant these little hints of humanity in your antagonist’s character, you can use them to evoke a twinge of sympathy in the reader, even if your antagonist earns (and deserves) hatred the rest of the time. <a title="Juxtaposition: The Power of the Unexpected in Fiction" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2010/10/juxtaposition-power-of-unexpected-in.html" target="_blank">There is nothing like conflicting emotions</a> to capture readers&#8217; attention and create a memorable antagonist who will stand the test of time. (Though a winning smile and cutting wit can’t hurt either. *Ahem, Loki.*)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week’s video points out one of the most egregious mistakes you can make in your story&#8217;s climax and how to make sure readers never look away from your exciting finale.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OBUW9DAl2Z0" width="640" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>Video Transcript:</h2>
<p>Imagine this: you’ve created an amazing story, full of amazing characters, who are clashing in an epic conflict. Your story&#8217;s climax has arrived, and, baby, it is tense. You’ve got readers on the edge of their seats. They’re turning those pages so fast they’re getting paper cuts. In other words, you’re doing everything right. <strong>But then—you do something wrong. You cut to a commercial break.</strong> “Don’t you dare touch that dial, folks! We’ll be right back with more exciting mayhem!”</p>
<p>Can you hear it?</p>
<p><em>Pssssssssssst</em>.</p>
<p><strong>That’s your story’s tension and your readers’ excitement deflating like a popped balloon. </strong></p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A735U0U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00A735U0U&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=Y2DEZMORFKNS6QQJ" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-7798 size-full" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Hunchback-of-Notre-Dame-Book-Cover-by-Victor-Hugo.jpg" alt="Hunchback of Notre Dame Book Cover by Victor Hugo" width="200" height="318" /></a>There’s an especially egregious example of this in the finale of Victor Hugo’s generally wonderful classic <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A735U0U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00A735U0U&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=Y2DEZMORFKNS6QQJ" target="_blank"><em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em></a>. He’s got his story’s climax cranked into high gear as the gypsies attempt to free La Esmeralda by launching a massive attack on the cathedral, which is then admirably defended by Quasimodo and his molten lead. It’s exciting, it’s tense, it’s right out of a blockbuster movie.</p>
<p>And then—<em>psssssssst</em>—Hugo cuts to the entirely low-key financial discussion and hypochondriacal worryings of the king, who to top things off has been an almost nonexistent player in the story up to this point. Even worse, this turns out to be one of the longest chapters in the book.</p>
<p><strong>Tension and excitement are always high commodities in a story, but <em>especially</em> in your story&#8217;s climax</strong>. This is show-me-the-money time. If you can’t deliver solid tension here, then you gotta wonder where it is working. Once you cruise into the do-or-die mayhem of your climax, don’t cut away from it for <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>If you’ve got unfinished business, you’ve got three choices:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Wait until the resolution to take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Tie off the loose ends before the climax starts.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Rework this unfinished business so that it’s actually exciting enough to belong in the climax without demolishing your story’s tension or your readers’ interest.</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: How are you keeping the tension high in your story&#8217;s climax?</strong></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, I&#8217;m going to be a bad blog writer. I&#8217;m not going to make you think at all to find the answer to the title question: &#8220;What is the role of theme in a story&#8217;s climax?&#8221; I&#8217;m just going to tell you straight up: The role of theme in your story&#8217;s climax is <em>all-important</em>. The theme is what makes the whole thing work with any kind of realism or meaning.</p>
<p>No pressure, right?</p>
<p>Actually, there <em>is</em> a lot of pressure, because if you miss the opportunity to knock your theme out of the park in <a title="Creating Stunning Character Arcs, Pt. 14: The Climax" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/05/character-arcs-14.html" target="_blank">your story&#8217;s climax</a>, then not only are you settling for less than the best for your story, but you may also end up crippling it.</p>
<p>But not to worry. As important a role as theme plays in a story&#8217;s climax, it&#8217;s also a totally fun and rewarding one. Even better, if you can figure out how theme will factor in to your story&#8217;s climax, then you&#8217;ll also have a shortcut to figuring out everything else you need to know about your theme.</p>
<h2>The Most Important Job of Theme in Your Story&#8217;s Climax</h2>
<p>Just what does theme <em>do</em> in the climax?</p>
<p>We sometimes think of theme as window dressing. It just sits there, looks pretty, and dresses up our novels with a little bit of moral magnitude. It makes our simple but entertaining tale of two star-crossed lovers into something that&#8217;s more <em>important</em> than just another happily-ever-after.</p>
<p>But if theme&#8217;s going to do that, it <em>has</em> to be more than just icing on the cake. It has to be the flour and eggs.</p>
<p>Stories themselves are just an expression&#8211;a dramatization&#8211;of their themes. And if your theme is a question, then the climax is the answer. When the story-long conflict comes to a head in the climax, the result of that final confrontation must provide more than just the external evidence of who won&#8211;the protagonist or the antagonistic force. The result of that conflict must also prove your story&#8217;s theme.</p>
<p>Consider Stephen King&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SR2PZG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002SR2PZG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=N4J47C4VFREB23AH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption</a>. </em>Andy Dufresne&#8217;s climactic escape isn&#8217;t just about his physical escape from the prison. It&#8217;s the final proof of the thematic Truth that hope lets us live through horrible circumstances and emerge triumphant on the other side. If he fails in his escape, he will not only remain in prison for the rest of his life, but his thematic premise will be proven false and its opposing assertion (&#8220;Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane.&#8221;) will be proven true.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Shawshank-Redemption-Fear-Can-Hold-You-Prisoners-But-Hope-Can-Set-You-Free1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7711 " src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Shawshank-Redemption-Fear-Can-Hold-You-Prisoners-But-Hope-Can-Set-You-Free1.jpg" alt="Shawshank Redemption Fear Can Hold You Prisoners But Hope Can Set You Free" width="401" height="434" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Your Story&#8217;s Climax Will Help You Find Your Theme</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042FZVOY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0042FZVOY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=NGFMPT3DMQQUF4K7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignright wp-image-7172 " src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/robert-mckee-story-200x300.jpg" alt="Story by Robert McKee" width="167" height="251" /></a>If you&#8217;re ever uncertain of your story&#8217;s theme (or, by extension, your character&#8217;s arc), you need look no farther than your story&#8217;s climax. In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042FZVOY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0042FZVOY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=NGFMPT3DMQQUF4K7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Story</em></a>, Robert McKee reminds us:</p>
<blockquote><p>For no matter your inspiration, ultimately the story embeds its <a title="Don’t Know Your Story’s Theme? Take a Look at Your Character’s Arc" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/11/storys-theme.html" target="_blank">Controlling Idea</a> [theme] within the final climax….</p></blockquote>
<p>What happens in your climax? What battle is your protagonist fighting? He&#8217;s almost certainly going to be in pursuit of <a title="Why Your Character’s Goal Needs to Be 1 of These 5 Things" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/10/characters-goal.html" target="_blank">some physical goal</a>. He needs to kill the bad guy, win back the girl, steal the Maltese Falcon. But beneath the surface of the physical treasure hunt, there will always be a deeper reason. Your <a title="Why Your Character’s Motive Matters" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2010/07/why-your-characters-motive-matters.html" target="_blank">character&#8217;s motivation</a> for gaining this thing <em>must</em> be central to your story&#8217;s theme.</p>
<p>If he fights this final battle for a reason unconnected to your theme, then your story will fall apart. It may still be a slam-bang finale. It may even still be a reasonably entertaining story. But it won&#8217;t be an intellectually and emotionally stimulating tour de force. Worse, it will be fundamentally sloppy and incoherent on <em>at least</em> a subconscious level.</p>
<h2>Create a Story That&#8217;s Built to Reinforce Your Climax&#8217;s Theme</h2>
<p>Creating a thematically sound climax involves much more than than the climax itself. In order to create a climax that resonantly answers your story&#8217;s thematic question, you first have to build an entire story that <em>asks</em> the right question. This involves not just setting up the question in your story&#8217;s opening act, via the <a title="Creating Stunning Character Arcs, Pt. 2: The Lie Your Character Believes" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/02/character-arcs-2.html" target="_blank">Lie Your Character Believes</a>. It also means creating a consistent, <em>story-long</em> battle between the Lie and the Truth. McKee again:</p>
<blockquote><p>The positive and negative assertions of the same idea contest back and forth through the [story], building in intensity, until at the Crisis they collide head-on in a last impasse. Out of this rises the Story Climax, in which one or the other idea succeeds.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s an easy rule of thumb: Ask yourself, &#8220;Is your story going to end with a positive assertion of your theme?&#8221; If it does, then, for all intents and purposes, your ending will be a happy one, no matter the physical circumstances in which your protagonist ends the story. If your story ends with this affirmation of your theme, then it needs to begin with a negative <em>assertion</em> of the theme. In other words, the story&#8217;s beginning must posit that the theme is false. For example, <em>Shawshank Redemption</em> opens with its main character in the most hopeless of all situations: imprisoned for life for a crime he didn&#8217;t commit with no chance for appeal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Shawkshank-Redemption-Tim-Robbins-Andy-Dufresne-first-day-in-prison.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7712 " src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Shawkshank-Redemption-Tim-Robbins-Andy-Dufresne-first-day-in-prison.jpg" alt="Shawshank Redemption Tim Robbins Andy Dufresne first day in prison" width="431" height="292" /></a></p>
<p>This negative assertion will then be countered by a positive assertion, then by a negative one, then by a positive one&#8211;and so on throughout the story until the final confrontation in the story&#8217;s climax when the thematic premise is finally proven once and for all.</p>
<p>(Of course this works in reverse for a story that will end by disproving the story&#8217;s Truth: it will begin with a <em>positive </em>assertion of the theme.)</p>
<p>Consider your story&#8217;s climax. How will it end? Happily or unhappily? How will your character have arced? Will he have <a title="Creating Stunning Character Arcs, Pt. 1: Can You Structure Characters?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/02/character-arcs-1.html" target="_blank">overcome his Lie and discovered the Truth</a>? Will he have <a title="How to Write a Flat Character Arc, Pt. 1: The First Act" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/06/flat-character-arc-1.html" target="_blank">helped others to find a Truth he already knows</a>? Or will he have <a title="How to Write a Negative Character Arc, Pt. 1: The First Act" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/07/negative-character-arc-1.html" target="_blank">fallen away from the Truth and into the Lie</a>?</p>
<p>Within the answers to these questions, you&#8217;ll find your story&#8217;s theme. Funnel your story&#8217;s main conflict into a final confrontation that will drive and by driven by the principle at the heart of your theme. Do that, and you will have strengthened every other aspect of your story.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s face it, writing is hard work. Sometimes, it feels like a battle to pen a single word onto the page. Writers face so many creative monsters in order to produce: self-doubt, criticism, rejection, procrastination, jealousy, and over-preparation. However, there’s one characteristic even more dangerous than all of the above since it’s so widespread and recognized. I’m talking about the #1 habit killing your writing.</p>
<p><em>Perfectionism.</em></p>
<p>Perfectionism is the devil because it’s a socially acceptable form of self-abuse. We applaud those who work 70-hour work weeks and win endless strings of awards and accolades, but who are divas to the extreme.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006H19H3M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006H19H3M&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=BTDSD7L54TTBEMBE" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-7760 " src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/The-Artists-Way-by-Julia-Cameron-249x300.jpg" alt="The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron" width="193" height="233" /></a>Julia Cameron of the famed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006H19H3M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006H19H3M&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=BTDSD7L54TTBEMBE" target="_blank"><em>Artist’s Way</em></a> says,</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of enjoying the process, the perfectionist is constantly grading the results.</p></blockquote>
<h2>What Perfectionism Looks Like in Real Life</h2>
<p>Years ago, I attended the Austin Film Festival and entered a “pitch contest.” <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Crazy people</span> Participants stood alone on a stage in front of hundreds of others and presented a three-minute synopsis of their films to a panel of judges. These industry professionals then critiqued each pitch.</p>
<p>My first time there, I beat all the competition on Day One and made it to the finals. I would be presenting in front of the entire conference.</p>
<p>I was a <em>rock star</em>!</p>
<p>Two days later, I was the first pitch at the finals&#8211;which is the kiss of death, since the judges have no comparisons for your work. I received a decent score, but didn’t win. I wasn’t even runner-up.</p>
<p>I was a <em>loser</em>!</p>
<p>I went from feeling like a million bucks to less than zero. I returned home devastated, <em>hating</em> myself because I’d lost, despite the fact I had made it to the finals on my very first try. You would’ve thought I was an axe murderer, I despised myself so much. The self-loathing lasted for months.</p>
<p><em>Helllllo</em>, perfectionist.</p>
<h2>What Perfectionism Is and Isn&#8217;t</h2>
<p>I want to be clear: there are distinct differences between striving for excellence and perfectionism. Let’s explore these a little closer.</p>
<h3>Striving for Excellence</h3>
<ul>
<li><a title="How to Tell if Your Book Is a Success" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2012/10/how-to-tell-if-your-book-is-success.html" target="_blank">Reasonable expectations</a> (understanding that writing is a process and you’ll grow over time&#8211;if you keep working at your craft).</li>
<li><a title="Are You Over-Thinking Your First Draft?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/06/are-you-over-thinking-your-first-draft.html" target="_blank">Satisfaction with less-than perfect writing in the first several drafts</a> of your work.</li>
<li><a title="Why Every Story You Write Is a Guaranteed Failure" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/06/story-you-write-is-a-guaranteed-failure.html" target="_blank">Ability to bounce back from disappointments or failure.</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Perfectionism</h3>
<ul>
<li>All-or-nothing thinking (either you’re a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, or you <em>suck</em>).</li>
<li>Obsessive behavior (spending two hours reworking one sentence until it’s flawless&#8211;or throwing out your entire manuscript and starting over).</li>
<li>Belief that mistakes or setbacks indicate your unworthiness.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Striving for excellence feels great because you’re trying your very best. Perfectionism feels miserable because you’re never quite good enough.</p>
<h2>Rip Off the Mask of Perfectionism</h2>
<p>When you expose this nasty culprit for what it really is, you’ll find:</p>
<p><em>Fear.</em></p>
<p>Yep, good old-fashioned fear.</p>
<p><em>Fear your writing isn’t good enough.</em></p>
<p><em>Fear that if even one person criticizes your work you’re doomed as writer.</em></p>
<p><em>Fear you’re not smart enough … talented enough … disciplined enough to create whatever story is tugging at your heart.</em></p>
<h2>3 Ways to Overcome Your Perfectionism</h2>
<p>I’ve completed four novels and had literary representation for two of those books. I’ve been paid for more magazine articles than I can count and am an award-winning copywriter/short-story author. I’ve been writing years and learned most lessons the hard way.</p>
<p>I’d like to spare you that pain and help you learn from my mistakes. So here are three tips to overcome perfectionism:</p>
<h3>1. Write Sucky First Drafts</h3>
<p>First drafts are meant to bad. Super bad. Give yourself permission to write the most awful, terrible, horrible junk ever. It takes the pressure off. You&#8217;re going to need to edit the entire manuscript <em>at least</em> three times before expecting anything polished or pretty. After that, find <a title="Writing Buddies: Why You Need Them, How to Find Them, What to Do With Them" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2008/12/writing-buddies.html" target="_blank">beta readers to critique your work</a>&#8211;folks who are strong editors, if not <a title="Is a Professional Editor a Waste of Money?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/03/professional-editor.html" target="_blank">paid professionals</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Write Faster than Your Fear</h3>
<p>Silence your internal critic by working quicker than your perfectionism. Don’t edit or censure as you go along, just get the words onto the page. You can polish it later. Turn your brain off and your hands on.</p>
<h3>3. Let It Go</h3>
<p>Nobody’s writing is ever <em>done</em>, but at some point you have to call it good and stop. I know I’ve reached that point when I’m just moving commas. I’ll read through the entire piece and make grammar changes, then read it again and move everything back. That’s when it’s time to let it go.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Let-It-Go-Enough-Batman-Robin.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7762 aligncenter" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Let-It-Go-Enough-Batman-Robin.jpg" alt="Let It Go Enough Batman Robin" width="318" height="317" /></a></p>
<p>Use these three tips to eliminate this habit killing your writing and learn how to have fun and write better stories&#8211;all at the same time!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re like me, then you&#8217;ve probably read hundreds of books on how to write amazing novels. You&#8217;ve nodded your head whenever a new epiphany lit up the light bulb above your head, and you highlighted every new idea you wanted to put to work in your own books. But chances are good you also forgot half those epiphanies and highlights in between reading those how-to books and sitting down to work on your own creations. <strong>That&#8217;s why workbooks can be such a fabulous tool for actually <em>implementing</em> all those important ideas in your writing.</strong></p>
<p>As most of you know I am the author of the internationally published how-to books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005NAUKAC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005NAUKAC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=XMCE5IKJ6IQLI5ST" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Outlining Your Novel</em></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EJX08QA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00EJX08QA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=ZCQCKRVH4EEF7JUW" target="_blank"><em>Structuring Your Novel</em></a>. Over the years, I&#8217;ve been thrilled to hear from many of you who have used the principles in these books to realize your dreams of writing and publishing great books. I&#8217;ve also been tickled to hear that many of you have highlighted the heck out of the books and read them over and over&#8211;sometimes every time you start a new novel!</p>
<p>But that got me to thinking: <strong><em>Surely there&#8217;s a way to make it easier for us </em>(yeah, I reference my own books too!) <em>to remember all this stuff and put it into action when planning, writing, and revising our stories</em>.</strong></p>
<h2>Introducing the Reader-Requested <em>Outlining Your Novel Workbook </em>and <i>Structuring Your Novel Workbook</i></h2>
<p>And then what should pop into my inbox but an email from reader Jim Berning who wondered if <strong>I had ever considered adapting <em>Outlining Your Novel</em> and <em>Structuring Your Novel</em> into workbooks. </strong></p>
<p>My first thought? <i>Duh! Why didn&#8217;t I think of that?</i></p>
<p>So with much thanks to Jim and many others who have helped see these books to fruition, <strong>I&#8217;m super-excited to be able to offer you the <em>Outlining Your Novel Workbook</em> and the <em>Structuring Your Novel Workbook</em>.</strong></p>
<p><em>Outlining Your Novel </em>showed you how to embrace outlines in a way that makes the writing process fun, inspiring, and easy. <em>Structuring Your Novel</em> showed you how to create stories with strong and compelling plot structure. Now it&#8217;s time to put those lessons to use! <strong>Containing hundreds of incisive questions and imagination-revving exercises, these accessible and streamlined workbooks will empower you to create powerful outlines, effective structures, and outstanding novels.</strong></p>

<h2>Grab Your Copies and Start Outlining and Structuring Your Novel Today!</h2>
<p>The workbooks are available in two formats. If you opt for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=k.%20m.%20weiland%20workbook&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;linkId=5SBD7CYY6HJLKQTW" target="_blank"><strong>paperbacks</strong></a>, you can write your answers to the questions right into the books.</p>
<p>But I was also determined to offer them as<strong> e-books</strong> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=k.%20m.%20weiland%20workbook&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Ak.%20m.%20weiland%20workbook&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=5PLIOOYO36DYPD2C" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kindle</a> and <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/k-m-weiland-workbooks?store=allproducts&amp;keyword=k.m.+weiland+workbooks" target="_blank">Epub</a>), since I knew the digital versions would end up being a more cost-efficient option for many of you. The digital versions include all the same questions and exercises as the paperback format, allowing you to brainstorm and write your answers in a notebook or on the computer (which makes the workbook totally reusable!).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=k.%20m.%20weiland%20workbook&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Ak.%20m.%20weiland%20workbook&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=5PLIOOYO36DYPD2C" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grab your copies right now</a> and start writing your best book today!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What separates a good story from a great one? We might throw out a lot of opinions, but mine is this: Your story&#8217;s <em>theme</em> is what will raise it above the pack, out of mere entertainment into something that sticks with readers, impacts their lives, and maybe even challenges them to grow. <em>Awesomesauce!</em>, you say. <em>Great theme, here I come!</em>, you say. But how do you <em>find</em> your story&#8217;s theme?</p>
<p>Half the problem with theme is that authors tend to look at it as if it exists in a vacuum. You&#8217;ve got a great story, so now you have to come up with an equally great theme to go along with it. But that doesn&#8217;t work any better than making a fab PB&amp;J sandwich and then realizing you left out the veggies: better stick some spinach in there, right?</p>
<p>Theme isn&#8217;t an add-on. It isn&#8217;t a bonus feature. Your story&#8217;s theme is its <em>heart</em>, and, as such, it must be all of a piece with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EJX08QA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00EJX08QA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">your plot</a> and <a title="Creating Stunning Character Arcs, Pt. 1: Can You Structure Characters?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/02/character-arcs-1.html" target="_blank">your characters&#8217; arcs</a>. So how do you find your story&#8217;s theme? Easy-peasy! Look no farther than your character&#8217;s arc.</p>
<h2>Theme Is The Foundation of Your Story</h2>
<p>In the October 2004 issue of <em>Writer&#8217;s Digest</em>, <a title="The Plot Whisperer" href="http://plotwhisperer.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Martha Alderson</a> explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>The theme is the “why”—your reason for writing the story&#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why <em>are</em> you writing this story? Why are you writing about <em>these</em> characters? What is it about their journey that has drawn your heart? What is the core of the tale? Justice, mercy, love, revenge, self-discovery? Whatever it is that&#8217;s moving the characters is what&#8217;s also moving your story. That&#8217;s your theme.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042FZVOY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0042FZVOY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=YIWYL24BQTOZXJVJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignright wp-image-7172 size-medium" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/robert-mckee-story-200x300.jpg" alt="Story by Robert McKee" width="200" height="300" /></a>In his bravura book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042FZVOY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0042FZVOY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=YIWYL24BQTOZXJVJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Story</em></a>, Robert McKee writes that instead of the term &#8220;theme&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>I prefer the phrase Controlling Idea, for like theme, it names a story’s root or central idea, but it also implies function: The Controlling Idea shapes the writer’s strategic choices. It’s yet another Creative Discipline to guide your aesthetic choices toward what is appropriate or inappropriate in your story, toward what is expressive of your Controlling Idea and may be kept versus what is irrelevant to it and must be cut.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, your theme is the lighthouse in your story&#8217;s sea. If you can identify your theme upfront, you&#8217;ll be able to keep your entire story on track. If any aspect of character or plot fails to contribute to this controlling idea of theme, then you know it&#8217;s probably extraneous.</p>
<p>So far, so good. But maybe you&#8217;ve already got a story in mind. Your characters are already involved in their journey. Their story has already started. It&#8217;s not like you can just pick any random theme and shoehorn it in&#8211;like that spinach in our no-longer-so-perfect PB&amp;J.</p>
<p>How can you <i>identify </i>the right theme when all the other story elements arrive first?</p>
<h2>Plot, Character Arc, and Theme: How They&#8217;re Connected and How They&#8217;re Different</h2>
<p>Remember way back when we talked about how character arcs are powered by the conflicting <a title="Creating Stunning Character Arcs, Pt. 3: The Thing Your Character Wants vs. The Thing Your Character Needs" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/02/character-arcs-3.html" target="_blank">Thing Your Character Wants and the Thing Your Character Needs</a>? Nestled right between the two is where you&#8217;ll find your theme. Here&#8217;s a quick refresher of what these two Things are and how they work in a story.</p>
<h3>The Thing Your Character Wants = Plot</h3>
<p>The Thing Your Character Wants is the <a title="Most Common Writing Mistakes: Characters Who Lack Solid Story Goals" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/10/common-mistakes-characters-lack-solid-story-goals.html" target="_blank">main story goal</a>. For whatever reason, your character <em>believes</em> he needs this thing. Maybe he does, maybe he doesn&#8217;t. But whatever it is, it drives his every action in the story. What he doesn&#8217;t realize, however, is that this Want isn&#8217;t what he <em>Needs</em>.</p>
<p>The Thing Your Character Wants&#8211;the main story goal&#8211;is your story&#8217;s plot.</p>
<h3>The Thing Your Character Needs = Theme</h3>
<p>This is the fundamental need at the core of your character. It&#8217;s something he&#8217;s almost certainly unconscious of to some extent. He might even be in denial about it. But he will never be complete until he recognizes and fulfills this need. Thanks to a fundamental <a title="Creating Stunning Character Arcs, Pt. 2: The Lie Your Character Believes" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/02/character-arcs-2.html" target="_blank">Lie He Believes</a>&#8211;about either himself or the world&#8211;he either believes he doesn&#8217;t want the Need or doesn&#8217;t deserve the Need. This is the <em>true</em> goal of your story, but it&#8217;s a goal that&#8217;s going to be working largely under the surface.</p>
<p>The Thing Your Character Needs is your story&#8217;s theme.</p>
<h3>The Thing Your Character Wants vs. the Thing Your Character Needs = Character Arc</h3>
<p>Put these two Things together by forcing your character to grow to the point of being willing to sacrifice his Want in order to gain his Need&#8211;and suddenly you&#8217;ve got a character arc. All three&#8211;plot, theme, and character arc&#8211;are integral to one another. Your character arc will always drive your plot, and your theme will always be found at the heart of the arc. Figure out the fundamental questions your character will be asking in his journey through the plot&#8211;figure out the crux of his change or <a title="How to Write a Flat Character Arc, Pt. 1: The First Act" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/06/flat-character-arc-1.html" target="_blank">lack thereof</a>&#8211;and you will have found the theme your story <em>must</em> tell.</p>
<h2>The Best Way to Double-Check Your Story&#8217;s Theme</h2>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve figured out the theme that is inherent to the heart of your story, take a moment to analyze whether this is really the <em>best</em> theme for this story. Might you get a better, more impactful theme if you were able to tweak your plot and character arc?</p>
<p>Double-check your story&#8217;s theme by summarizing it as briefly as possible. Is it something general like <em>justice vs. mercy</em>? Or is it something super-specific like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084BMUFA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0084BMUFA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=VEWZQVHZMSHYZ4G7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>A Christmas Carol</em></a>&#8216;s <em>better to die a pauper than unloved</em>?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jim-Carrey-A-Christmas-Carol-Ebenezer-Scrooge-Ghost-of-Christmas-Past.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7629 aligncenter" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jim-Carrey-A-Christmas-Carol-Ebenezer-Scrooge-Ghost-of-Christmas-Past-1024x437.jpg" alt="Jim Carrey A Christmas Carol Ebenezer Scrooge Ghost of Christmas Past" width="600" height="256" /></a></p>
<p>The value of summing up your story&#8217;s theme like this is that it gives you a better sense of its relative originality and <em>risk</em>. Don&#8217;t settle for safe themes. Look for dangerous, controversial ones. You want to make readers think. You want to ask hard questions&#8211;not the same old questions that are asked over and over again. True originality is always found in theme. The braver and more honest your theme, the more original and true your story will be.</p>
<p>Take a moment to consider your story&#8217;s theme. Does it leap right out at you? Or do you have to do a little digging? And when you do find it, does it work in harmony with your plot and character arcs? Now think about how you can strengthen and refine it to create something truly special.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dialogue drives both narrative and character development. The key for creative writers is including just enough dialogue to meet those needs and no more. The last thing you want is to have your characters talking too much.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/rossamazon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="wp-image-7676 size-medium alignright" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Committed-front-cover-200x300.jpg" alt="Committed A Memoir of the Artist's Road by Patrick Ross" width="200" height="300" /></a>Many novelists approach a scene by writing until they feel they have included sufficient dialogue to meet their goals. It&#8217;s an additive process, like 3D printing. While writing <a title="Committed: A Memoir of the Artist's Road" href="http://bit.ly/rossmemoir" target="_blank"><em>Committed: A Memoir of the Artist&#8217;s Road </em></a>I took the opposite approach, like a sculptor carving away at stone.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that? Well, my raw material included video of more than forty creatives&#8211;musicians, photographers, actors, and of course novelists&#8211;whom I had interviewed on a 2010 cross-country U.S. road trip. The memoir tells the story of how my encounters with these artists inspired me to return to an art-committed life, despite a family legacy of mental illness connected with creative pursuits. Each scene&#8217;s first draft began with a transcript of the conversation. I then started cutting and polishing, looking to convey just enough to advance the narrative lines of the story and the reader&#8217;s understanding of the narrator.</p>
<h2>How to Judge the Worth of Your Dialogue on a Spectrum</h2>
<p>How did I make those choices?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s think of the use of dialogue in a story&#8211;fiction or creative nonfiction&#8211;as a spectrum:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dialogue-spectrum.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7677 aligncenter" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dialogue-spectrum.jpg" alt="Are Your Characters Talking Too Much? - dialogue spectrum" width="635" height="72" /></a><br />
The two ends of the spectrum are easy to address:</p>
<h3>Cut the Scene Entirely</h3>
<p>Does having characters engage in a particular conversation advance the story? If not, cut.</p>
<h3>Include Every Line of Dialogue</h3>
<p>A creative writer should <em>never </em>do this. Disagree? Record the next conversation at your dinner table and play it back while doing the dishes. You&#8217;ll be startled at <a title="Most Common Writing Mistakes, Pt. 34: Repetitive Dialogue" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/10/repetitive-dialogue.html" target="_blank">how much extraneous material is found in even the most erudite conversation</a>.</p>
<p>Every scene that made it into <em>Committed</em> operates in the middle of the spectrum, as follows:</p>
<h3>Fully Realized Scene</h3>
<p>Only about a half-dozen creatives in <em>Committed </em>advanced the narrative sufficiently to merit a fully robust scene. Where they appeared in the story factored into that decision, but sometimes I needed the reader to not just hear what these artists were saying but to get to know them; that required enough dialogue and action to more fully convey their true natures.</p>
<p>One occurs early on, when seasoned Vermont printmaker Sabra Field warns me that an art-committed life is not an easy one. Another occurs near the end of the book, when Idaho singer/songwriter Rochelle Smith sums up the lesson of many artists interviewed, namely that I need to &#8220;<a title="5 Signs You’re Hiding Behind Your Writing—and 5 Ways to Use It as a Mirror Instead" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/10/hiding-behind-writing-using-mirror.html" target="_blank">tell my story</a>.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Handful of Dialogue</h3>
<p>Readers meet several of the artists in <em>Committed</em> in abbreviated scenes with a handful of quotes framed with summary dialogue. I found Birmingham, Alabama, photographer Marc Bondarenko fascinating, but only two parts of his interview advanced the narrative lines of the book, his love of motorcycles and his insight that spending time with another creative can spark a temporary connection. Much of Providence, Rhode Island, film director Eileen Boarman&#8217;s interview didn&#8217;t make it into the final book because the conversation occurs in a larger scene where the action taking place served the story better.</p>
<h3>Present-Tense Summary</h3>
<p><em>Committed </em>is written in the present tense; the reader experiences the road trip in real time with the narrator. In some cases the reader &#8220;meets&#8221; an artist but never hears the artist speak. This happens because we are in the narrator&#8217;s head, and he tells us what he&#8217;s hearing, as well as the thoughts those words are triggering. I chose to use this technique with Portland, Maine, photographer Brian Fitzgerald for structural reasons. He appears in the third scene in <em>Committed</em>; the first two featured fairly robust scenes of dialogue. Feedback in an MFA workshop made me realize I couldn&#8217;t have each chapter follow a predictable pattern: arrive in town, conduct full-blown interview, leave.</p>
<h3>Past-Tense Summary</h3>
<p>How does past-tense summary work in a present-tense book? It has the narrator telling the reader, &#8220;So we&#8217;re here together on the road again. An hour ago I interviewed this artist, and here&#8217;s what you missed.&#8221; I was forced to take an interesting conversation with Salt Lake City, Utah, jazz singer and children&#8217;s book author Wendy Bradshaw and reduce it to a past-tense paragraph because she appears near the end of the book, and her insights, while welcome, had already been provided by other interview subjects.</p>
<p>You may have seen a 3D printer in action. If so, you know how long it can take to make layer after layer as it builds to a fully realized object. There are also many hours of inputting details into computer software before the manufacturing begins. I found it easier with <em>Committed </em>to go old-school and sculpt. Michelangelo claimed that when he sculpted he was liberating already existing art from within the stone. I took that approach in first writing a fully realized scene and then reducing it down to its core.</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: What challenges do you face when writing dialogue and avoiding characters talking too much?</strong></h3>
