				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From author Alexandra Lanc:</p>
<blockquote><p> Some time ago (in October, which seems like centuries past now) I wrote my annual publishing anniversary post, talking about some things I&#8217;ve learned about publishing, writing, and myself over the last year, and the years before, but today I want to talk a bit about my publishing history too, and&#8230;my future?</p>
<p>I put a question mark there because it&#8217;s difficult to say what will happen in said future. I am confident, certainly, and I know what I think will happen, what I want to happen, but what we want is often not what we get &#8212; because often, what we get is in so many ways much better and stronger than what we want.</p>
<p>Such has been the case with my self-publishing: it has certainly not been anything I thought it would be, but in many ways it has been better, because I&#8217;ve learned so much from it, and have seen a side of myself that I would not have seen otherwise.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>I am twenty-three now, soon to be twenty-four, and I still get strange looks, snide comments, and the like when I tell people that I am an author. They haven&#8217;t gone away, though through the years I have met people who can recognize that it doesn&#8217;t matter how old you are &#8212; all that matters is the words &#8212; and those people constantly lift me up. So what if I&#8217;m not even twenty-five yet? Who said an author had to be older? Authors are as various as the stories that are penned, and that is a good thing. Age difference, background, religion, experience: all of these things give us different perspectives that should be respected, not tossed into the void.</p>
<p>Over four years ago (I started querying at about 17, I think), as the rejection letters poured in, and the market went crazy, and I searched for some way to be a writer despite the scowls I was receiving, I walked into a bookshop. It was a little bookshop, cozy and quaint, with wonderful shelves and a little cafe. On the side there was a large room where they held art classes for kids, and in the back there was a small cinema where they played old-fashioned cartoons, and independent, and black-and-white films. My mother and I happened upon the bookstore simply by chance &#8212; if you believe in that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Inside I searched, wide-eyed, as I do whenever I go into a bookstore. Fingers drift over spines, I inhale the sweet, musty smell of old pages, and the books seem to speak to me. Bookstores are a beautiful thing. But the real magic came when I went to pay for my books, and met the owner of the bookshop. I am ashamed to say that I cannot remember her name &#8212; I&#8217;ve always been terrible with names &#8212; but I can remember her face. She was a middle-aged woman, perhaps nearing her fifties, and she had curling hair, pulled back, brown. The air of an author hung about her, the air of literary dignity, and she thanked us for coming into the store. Then she mentioned her books, and pointed them out to us. They stood directly behind me on a loving little shelf of their own: children&#8217;s books with unique covers, which reminded me of mosaic stones. I flipped through the books and was amazed, and then I told her the terrifying truth: that I was a writer, too.</p>
<p>Only this woman didn&#8217;t scoff, didn&#8217;t judge. She was happy to hear it, and she asked me what I wrote, if I was going to get published, how long I had been writing. Finally, I was a <em>peer</em> instead of a sad little teenage girl with a dream she couldn&#8217;t possibly fulfill until she was at least fifty (because aren&#8217;t writers supposed to be at least fifty, maybe forty, maybe in their late thirties, if they&#8217;re lucky?). We talked for quite a while, and it felt amazing, to finally be considered a writer &#8212; and especially by someone who was published! But then she told me that she had published herself, and that I should look into it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit, I was skeptical. Self-publishing was still considered&#8230;eh&#8230;at that point, despite the fact that some people were doing quite well selling e-books . . . . But with the mass of rejections, and the fact that nobody seemed to want to take me seriously due to my age, I decided to look into it.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Through my four years self-publishing I have released nearly twenty books, though not all of them are still published &#8212; due to the fact that many of them have been experiments, have been ways for me to try different writing techniques, release times, story ideas, both to see what works in the market and what doesn&#8217;t; the information alone is very valuable to me. I have had several bestsellers on Amazon &#8212; not all of them free, though that still technically counts&#8230;in a way.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties, what I was given was, while not what I wanted, <em>exactly</em> what I needed. It has made me stronger, as trials do, and now I&#8217;m ready to take on the next leg of my journey.</p>
<p>What might that be, Alexandra? Well: querying. Things truly do come full circle.</p>
<p>Though I have enjoyed many things about self-publishing, I have come to understand that it simply isn&#8217;t the best route for me. I have never given up my hope and dream of one day being part of a large team, part of a publishing house, of seeing my book on the bookstore shelves (say what you like about print, but it still means the world to me), seeing my name and my book listed on a publisher&#8217;s site &#8212; and I&#8217;ll admit, a film would be great, too&#8230;or maybe a musical, a la Wicked; I aim high, always. This is my dream, and I&#8217;m prepared to fight to the death for it. It may take years, much sweat and tears, but nothing worth having comes easy.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Amazon launched the Kindle Unlimited service last July, the idea was that popular indie authors could use the service as a way to gather royalties and raise their author profiles in tandem. The all-you-can-eat reading service was supposed to help, not harm, authors.</p>
<p>The opposite has been the case. After the launch of KU a number of prolific writers have seen sales drop precipitously. The Digital Reader found a number of examples including writer H.M. Ward whose sales fell by 70 percent. She wrote:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">￼Ok, some of you already know, but I had my serials in it for 60 days and lost approx 75% of my income.Thats counting borrows and bonuses. My sales dropped like a stone. The number of borrows was higher than sales. They didn’t compliment each other, as expected.Taking a huge ass pay cut while I’m still working my butt off, well that’s not ok. And KU effected my whole list, not just KU titles. At the time of enrollment I had about 60 titles total.I planned on giving it 90 days, but I have a kid in the hospital for long term care and I noticed my spending was going to exceed my income-by a lot. I couldn’t wait and watch thing plummet further. I pulled my books. That was on Nov 1, &amp; since then my net revenue has gone up. I’m now at 50% of where I was pre-KU. During the time I was in KU, I had 2 new releases. Neither preformed vastly different than before. They actually earned far less (including borrows).</div>
<p>But Ward added an interesting aside near the end of her post: she would love to offer her readers a paid subscription to her work.</p>
<p>Ward, with 60 pieces in the Kindle store, is a rare case of a writer who is making a living from her writing through sheer volume. Most writers have one book in them at best but, as most Kindle experts note, the best way to make money is to write, publish, and repeat – ad infinitum.</p>
<div> By allowing users to subscribe to writers like Ward they will be doing everyone a solid. Ward and other writers will get a steady stream of income, readers will get the work of their favorite authors automatically, and Amazon has a captive source of revenue. Patreon, created by Jack Conte, is a perfect example of this dynamic. That service allows fans to pay a small amount every time an author creates a piece of content, be it a song, a blog post, or a podcast. By ensuring that the creator is paid the consumer ensures the content keeps coming.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From The Digital Reader:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the year draws to a close many are looking back at 2014 and reflecting on the year’s events. Today I would like to take a look at an event which would have been a huge news story if it had ever happened.</p>
<p>As you may recall, for much of 2014 Hachette and Amazon were in a nasty contract negotiation here in the US. As we all know from following the news, Hachette fought a vicious media campaign against Amazon as a way of pressuring Amazon to give in, but what no one else knew was that Hachette had a second string to their bow.</p>
<p>Just so you know: I have very little evidence to back up the following post. I trust my sources, and I do have a little evidence, but you should take this report with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Earlier this year Hachette secretly started developing an ebookstore calledwww.eBooksForAll.com. That store never launched, but my sources tell me that it would have sold Hachette titles in both Epub and Kindle formats.</p>
<p>Yes, Kindle. Hachette’s new ebookstore was going to use digital watermark DRM on the ebooks it sold.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>In short, Hachette nearly launched a site which could have directly competed with the Kindle Store. I can’t tell you why it was not launched, but I do have some more background details.</p>
<p>The site was developed by an Australia-based ebook company called eBooks.com, which would operate the site on behalf of Hachette. The  watermark DRM would have been supplied by Booxtream, which also provides a similar service to Pottermore and other ebook retailers.</p>
<p>eBooks For All was supposed to go live in the summer, and then in the early fall, but now that December has rolled around I figure the idea is probably dead, and thus it is safe to tell everyone about what would have been the biggest digital publishing story of the year.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Hachette apparently acquired the domain in April 2014, not too long after their previous contract with Amazon lapsed. Is it just me, or does that raise some new questions as to why the contract was allowed to expire?</p></blockquote>

<p>PG would have liked to see what Hachette&#8217;s idea of an ebook store looked like.</p>
<p>As PG has said, based on some personal ecommerce responsibilities in a past life, Amazon&#8217;s web site  is a work of sublime genius, the Mona Lisa of ecommerce sites.</p>
<p>(PG understands that appreciation for the art of ecommerce is a taste that most people never acquire. The Mona Lisa is easier to enjoy. He will note that Mona Lisa and Amazon share an enigmatic smile, however.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Dean Wesley Smith:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve mentioned this concept a number of times on my nightly blog and in the Topic of the Night little sections. But since Pulp Speed was almost impossible in the new traditional world, it belongs as a post in this series.</p>
<p>Not at all sure why this idea sort of hits me right. I think because it flies in the face of all the myths. A writer has to have all myths under control to even attempt this. So this post might just make you angry because it hits at belief systems I’m afraid.</p>
<p>The second reason I can’t shake this idea is because for all of my life I have idolized pulp writers.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Many, many of the great writers of the past that we still read and enjoy were pulp writers. And there are many pulp writers working today. More than you might imagine, even through the rough times of the last twenty years in traditional publishing.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Dickens was one of the early great Pulp Writers. And there were many along the way before the turn of 1900. It was then that the “literary” group split from the “writing for the masses” group of writers.</p>
<p>To the literary group, their writing had to be important, something to struggle to read, and only be published in leather hardbound books.</p>
<p>The masses group of writers just wanted to tell stories that would entertain readers.</p>
<p>Around this split period of 1900, the pulp magazines were coming in, and with the pulp magazine expansion, stories were needed to fill the pages of the exploding pulp magazine field. And the writers who could write sellable stories quickly discovered they could become very rich writing for one cent per word.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Doc Savage was a pulp character created mostly by Lester Dent and his publisher under a magazine house name. He wrote 159 of the Doc Savage novels for the Doc Savage pulp magazine, among many other books under other names, including his own name. There was a novel from Dent in most issues of Doc Savage Magazine for a decade or more. You can still buy Doc Savage novels by Dent today.</p>
<p>Some pulp writers got so famous, they were some of the richest people in the country. One year in the 1940s, the pen name Max Brand had thirteen movies in production from his books. Some of you may even remember Max Brand’s Dr. Kildare from television. Either the first television series or the second.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>By the way, the author behind Max Brand was Frederick Faust. Faust had a bunch of other prolific pen names besides Brand. For just one magazine group in the 1920s he wrote over a million words per year for the entire decade. Plus other stories and novels for other magazines.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>When the pulps finally died in the late 1950s, Pulp Speed writers turned to paperbacks through the 1960s and 1970s and wrote everything a publisher wanted. There were lots and lots of Pulp Speed writers producing upwards of 30 novels a year if not more. And most books were under many pen names and across many genres. Novels in this time period were still in the 40,000 word range.</p>
<p>In the 1980s publishers started to artificially inflate the size of novels because of the publisher’s need to charge more for a paperback. Pulp Speed writers kept on.  Numbers worked the category romance field, many worked westerns which had kept their smaller size.</p>
<p>And as normal, Pulp Speed writers worked across all genres. Fewer titles produced, but more words per book, so same production. Many Pulp Speed writers worked series novels for publishers during this period. And a lot of media novels.</p>
<p>But by the 1990s and early this century, most of the Pulp Speed writers had retired and very few new writers understood that Pulp Speed world was out there. It was almost impossible to understand when publishers limited a writer to one book per year. But some Pulp Speed writers still existed and worked through the period.</p>
<p>But now, with the advent of the indie world, Pulp Speed writers are coming back. It is possible again. And fun.</p>
<p>The golden age of fiction for readers has returned.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From The Chicago Tribune:</p>
<blockquote><p>Public libraries in Illinois once again are seeking to bring an author laboring in relative obscurity into the limelight.</p>
<p>For the second year in a row, the libraries are hosting The Soon to be Famous Illinois Author project that will choose a self-published Illinois author&#8217;s work for a year of book talks, author events and other promotions in Illinois public libraries.</p>
<p>Illinois authors who have self-published an adult fiction book are encouraged to enter the second year of the Soon to be Famous Illinois Author project until Dec. 15. The winner of the Soon to be Famous Illinois Author Project will spend a year being promoted in libraries throughout the state, participating in book signings, special presentations, media interviews, and conference appearances.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>&#8220;Librarians are all about connecting readers with books (or viewers with films, etc.),&#8221; said Dee Brennan, executive director of RAILS, a regional library system, in an email. &#8220;It&#8217;s our job to seek out the best books we can and deliver them to readers. We need to look beyond the traditional publishing world to include and support the aspiring authors who haven&#8217;t been able to break through the publishing &#8216;wall.&#8217; Who knows when we will find the next Gillian Flynn?&#8221;</p>
<p>The project was the brainchild of a group of library marketing professionals who were inspired by remarks made by New York University professor David Vinjamuri about the importance of libraries in an era of E-books, said Christine Cigler, marketing manager of the Fox River Valley Public Library District.</p>
<p>She said Vinjamuri challenged libraries to bring attention to a self-published Illinois author and demonstrate the influence libraries and librarians have over the public&#8217;s reading selections.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The discovery of talent via YouTube, a resurgence at Waterstones, the long-running Amazon/Hachette terms dispute and the thinning out of independent publisher numbers were among the significant developments in 2014, according to prominent figures in the industry.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>It was a &#8220;tough&#8221; year, according to Pan Macmilllan m.d. Anthony Forbes Watson, given the year-on-year drop in Nielsen BookScan TCM figures matched with a flattening of e-book growth, but one which brought focus back to &#8220;the fundamentals of publishing&#8221;. PRH UK&#8217;s Weldon said publishing had demonstrated &#8220;its resilience, its diversity and its deep-rooted cultural relevance&#8221;, despite a &#8220;tough&#8221; UK market, which meant growth came mainly in children&#8217;s and export.</p>
<p>There was widespread consensus that big names and brands became even more important: S&amp;S UK&#8217;s Ian Chapman reflected on their &#8220;ever-increasing dominance&#8221; and the impact of the big YA and adult films on book sales. HarperCollins Childrens Books publisher Ann-Janine Murtagh agreed, saying: &#8220;In 2014 the big brands have just got even bigger, and brands are now focused on quality storytelling.&#8221; It was also the year the market learned what a vlogger was, noted Bell Lomax Moreton&#8217;s Paul Moreton. Yet the lack of any single publishing &#8220;phenomenon&#8221; &#8211; Minecraft books aside – had left &#8220;oxygen for other books&#8221;, according to Orion General m.d. Lisa Milton.</p>
<p>Fears for the future of independent publishing were raised, with Alma Books&#8217; Alessandro Gallenzi referring to &#8220;an eerie atmosphere of impending doom&#8221; among his indie peers.</p></blockquote>

<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Xavier Garambois, who is vice-president of EU retail at Amazon, said: &#8220;Ever since we introduced Black Friday to the UK in 2010, sales have increased year-on-year but this year really has surpassed all of our expectations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The public&#8217;s appetite for Black Friday has been bigger than ever, kicking off the Christmas shopping period in earnest and establishing Black Friday as a fixture on the UK Christmas shopping calendar.&#8221;</p>
<p>While last year&#8217;s Black Friday was also a record for Amazon UK, that was surpassed on Cyber Monday 2013, when more than 4.1 million items were ordered at a rate of some 47 purchases per second.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Since his promotion to CEO of Barnes &amp; Noble  in January 2014, Michael Huseby has been preparing the struggling Nook digital media division for sale, but so far no suitors have shown themselves. Huseby should look no further than the world&#8217;s largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores .</p>
<p>Wal-Mart has been steadily investing in and growing its digital businesses and needs to find more ways to compete with Amazon. While Nook has been failing since 2012, it still has underlying assets &#8212; a catalog of millions of e-books, thousands of relationships with publishers and suppliers, and a robust self-publishing services business &#8212; that would be valuable for a company interested in investing in e-books and would be hard to build from scratch.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>&#8220;It is definitely a good idea if Wal-Mart cares about being in the book business or the digital media business long term,&#8221; said book publishing consultant Mike Shatzkin. &#8220;If that&#8217;s a priority for them, acquiring Nook would probably be the cheapest way to ensconce themselves in the game.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Nook, Barnes &amp; Noble was once solidly the No. 2 e-book retailer in the U.S., behind Amazon, with a reported 25% market share to Amazon&#8217;s 65%. That was in 2012, when Nook revenues eclipsed $900 million and then-CEO William Lynch charted a course to reach $1 billion in annual revenue.</p>
<p>The plan involved Nook continuing to sell more Nook devices in the growing tablet business, as well as selling more e-books on those devices and increasing digital content sales across the board.</p>
<p>Neither of those things happened.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>What&#8217;s next for Nook?</p>
<p>Barnes &amp; Noble has said that spinning off Nook as a separate public company is also an option to exit the business. With a consistent track record of losses and declining revenues, it&#8217;s not a very good one.</p>
<p>Instead, Barnes &amp; Noble should sell Nook to Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>According to one source who did not want to be named, the big retailer is exploring entering the e-book business. Buying Nook would be an easy and inexpensive way for the company to do so. Wal-Mart declined to comment.</p>
<p>Like many Amazon competitors, Wal-Mart has been trying to expand in digital. It expects its e-commerce sales in 2015 to increase to $12.5 billion after accelerating its digital investments to between $1.2 and $1.5 billion, up from $1 billion in 2014.</p>
<p>While $12.5 billion is nothing to sneeze at, it&#8217;s a fraction of Amazon&#8217;s projected 2015 revenue, which will eclipse $100 billion. And it&#8217;s less than 3% of Wal-Mart&#8217;s $473 billion in sales in 2014, which are expected to grow 2% to 4% in 2015.</p>
<p>A Wal-Mart spokesperson said that funds for digital acquisitions would not come from its capital expenditures on digital expansion and pointed out that the company has made 14 e-commerce acquisitions in the past several years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are open to acquisitions if they fit into our enterprise strategy,&#8221; the spokesperson said, via email.</p>
<p>Nook &#8220;is a nice fit with Wal-Mart&#8217;s print book business,&#8221; said James McQuivey, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester focused on the book publishing industry. &#8220;They could probably also get it for a decent price.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be sure, there are significant risks. In the U.K., retailers Tesco and Sainsbury both launched e-book businesses, but Amazon still has about 90% of the market.</p></blockquote>

<p>PG says if Big Publishing thinks Amazon is tough when negotiating contracts with suppliers, they&#8217;ll gain some perspective on that subject should Wal-Mart enter the ebook business.</p>
