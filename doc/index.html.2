Those feelings aren’t reserved for the movies.</p> <p>But how much study have you put into <i>how</i> your favorite horror authors have gone about scaring you with the written word?</p> <p>Movies rely on editing, music cues, performance, special visual and makeup effects . . . a whole parade of <a title="Writing a Novel? 6 Visual Storytelling Techniques to Borrow From Film and TV" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/writing-novel-6-visual-storytelling-techniques-borrow-film-tv/" target="_blank">cinematic tools</a>. But in prose all we have to work with are words, and our readers’ imaginations. The good news is that those are powerful tools.</p> <p>Though you may not have much control over any individual reader’s imagination, or his interpretation of your work, the ways you arrange words into sentences and sentences into paragraphs can activate your readers’ psyches in ways you may not have thought possible.</p> <h2><b>It all comes down to breathing</b></h2> <p>Even when reading silently, we tend to breathe along with what we’re reading as if we were reading it aloud. It’s impossible for us to turn certain parts of our brain off and when something causes us to start <a title="FREAKY: Your Breathing Patterns Change When You Read Email" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.businessinsider.com/email-apnea-how-email-change-breathing-2012-12" target="_blank">breathing differently</a>, that forces us into different states. When you’re in a blind panic you tend to hyperventilate, breathing in quick, shallow gasps. When you’re nervous or anxious about something (the feeling of suspense), you tend to hold your breath, and breathe more slowly.</p> <p>The good news for horror and thriller authors is that these processes also work <i>in reverse</i>. <b>If you can force that breathing state</b> (or, more accurately, some smaller, less physically traumatic version of that state) <b>in your readers, you’ll bring on the requisite psychological response.</b></p> <h2><b>Evoking suspense and anxiety</b></h2> <p>When you’re building suspense, evoking a feeling of impending doom or the terrifying fear of the unknown, get your reader to hold her breath. Stop her from taking her next breath for longer than normal. And though it may seem impossible to do this with words on a page, remember what I said about how we unconsciously breathe as though we’re reading aloud even when we aren’t.</p> <p>One of the reasons that sentences are finite is that the period at the end allows us a breath. Paragraphs give us a chance to take a deeper breath. So if you want your reader to slow her breathing and start feeling nervous, anxious or fearful, keep your sentences long, and your paragraphs even longer.</p> <p>Very near the beginning of Shirley Jackson’s classic <a title="The Haunting of Hill House" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143039989/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0143039989&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=ABIDEC3TV3SFGLPV" target="_blank"><i>The Haunting of Hill House</i></a>, the protagonist, Eleanor, is on her way to meet her fellow paranormal investigators at a house that’s known to be haunted. Though excited about being a part of something potentially important, and getting away from her dreary life in the city, Eleanor is terrified of what she’ll find there, not just from ghosts but as a result of what we’d now refer to as social anxiety. The closer she gets to the house, the more anxious she is.</p> <p>Jackson conveys this anxiety with a single paragraph wherein Eleanor makes a stop in a small town along the way and has a cup of coffee. It’s an innocuous scene, but told in a tight <a title="Point of View: How Writers Can Master This Crucial Story Element" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/point-of-view/" target="_blank">POV</a>, it’s incredibly nerve-wracking. This single paragraph consists of ten sentences. The first of those sentences is the shortest at 28 words. The last is the longest at 52 words.</p> <p>Think about the last time you read, much less wrote, a sentence that’s 52 words long.</p> <p><b>By the end of that monster paragraph, Shirley Jackson left her readers gasping for air</b>, and helped solidify <i>The Haunting of Hill House </i>as one of the undisputed classics of the genre.</p> <h2><b>Eliciting horror and panic</b></h2> <p>On the flip side, eventually the monster, serial killer or villain finally reveals himself and the terror (a generalized, creepy dread) turns to horror (the visceral reaction to a traumatic event in progress).</p> <p>Now you want to do just the opposite: <b>Force your readers to breathe </b><b><i>too often</i></b><b>.</b> Get them hyperventilating. Do this with short sentences. Even shorter paragraphs.</p> <p>One-sentence paragraphs.</p> <p>In another classic haunted house tale, <a title="Hell House" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312868855/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0312868855&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=P2KIFBWUFOBAS4KH" target="_blank"><i>Hell House</i></a>, author Richard Matheson evokes this feeling of panic in one scene of nine paragraphs, each with no more than two short sentences. Readers have been trained to take a full breath after each paragraph, so breaths are coming fast and furious through:</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>She stopped with a gasp and looked at the Spanish table.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>The telephone was ringing.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>It can’t, she thought. It hasn’t worked in more than thirty years.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>She wouldn’t answer it. She knew who it was.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>It kept on ringing, the shrill sounds stabbing at her eardrums, at her brain.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>She mustn’t answer it. She wouldn’t.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>The telephone kept ringing.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>“No,” she said.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>Ringing. Ringing. Ringing. Ringing.</i></p> <p>I know &#8212; technically, that last paragraph has four sentences, but let’s consider that staccato stacking of “Ringing”s as one sentence with partial breaths between each word.</p> <p>Instead of a single ten-sentence-long paragraph, we have paragraphs of one or two sentences, with the longest sentence/paragraph clocking in at 14 words, or precisely half the length of Shirley Jackson’s <i>shortest</i> sentence.</p> <p>Following this scene, there are a couple of slightly longer paragraphs as the protagonist tries to take charge of the situation, but this is quickly dismissed by more staccato attacks on the senses. And, like <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i>, the ongoing success of <i>Hell House</i> is proof of its effectiveness.</p> <h2><b>Putting this technique into practice</b></h2> <p>This idea of controlling your readers’ breathing is not the be-all-end-all of “<a title="Writing Scary: How to Use Pacing, Sentence Structure, and Word Choice to Scare the Pants Off Your Readers" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~tutorials.writersdigest.com/p-507-writing-scary-how-to-use-pacing-sentence-structure-and-word-choice-to-scare-the-pants-off-your-readers.aspx" target="_blank">writing scary</a>,” but with some practice it will work for you.</p> <p>And being aware of when to best use this strategy will also prevent you from overusing it, and move the majority of your prose somewhere into the readable, accessible, and comfortable center &#8212; until you want things to start getting scary again.</p> <p><strong><b>Do you “write scary”?

How are you supposed to erase or replace the precious words and sentences you’ve slaved over?</p> <p>Though it’s only been a few months since I’ve gone <a title="How to Handle Being a Full-Time Freelancer (Without Going Nuts)" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/how-to-handle-being-a-full-time-freelancer-without-going-nuts/" target="_blank">full-time freelance</a> as an editor and writer, I’ve already witnessed dozens of simple mistakes all writers (including this one) can fix on their own.</p> <p>While self-editing is often creativity-destroying when writing your first draft, wise writers would do well to work through the following suggestions before sending their manuscript to a professional editor or to their <a title="Writing Feedback: The Ultimate Guide to Working with Beta Readers" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/ultimate-guide-to-beta-readers/" target="_blank">beta readers</a>.</p> <p>In addition to making you more aware of your grammatical blind spots, <b>self-editing may save you money if your editor works on a per-hour basis</b>. And though editors love to display their knowledge, they also like reading grammatically correct manuscripts.</p> <p>When you show that you’re a capable and confident writer who makes few mistakes, you may just endear yourself to an editor, and having one already lined up means one less task on your publishing to-do list the next time around. Furthermore, your beta readers and advanced review copy (ARC) reviewers will be grateful for the care you took in creating a readable early draft.</p> <p>Ready to give your book a solid self-edit? Here’s what to do.</p> <h2><b>1. Rest your manuscript</b></h2> <p>When you’ve finished typing the last word of your masterpiece, set it aside for a few days. If you can stand it, set it aside for a week or more.</p> <p>Why? You want to try to <b>forget everything you’ve written so that when you do come back to self-edit, the book almost seems as if someone else wrote it.</b> You want fresh eyes, and the best way to do that is to rid your mind of what’s been filling it for so long.</p> <h2><b>2. Print your manuscript or read it out loud</b></h2> <p>For some writers, seeing words on paper helps them catch errors they otherwise wouldn’t have seen. For others, hearing the text spoken aloud makes mistakes obvious.</p> <p>You can enlist a (very patient) friend to read it to you, or you can go the friendship-saving route and use one of a number of apps to have your book read to you in a semi-robotic voice.</p> <p>I’ve heard<a title="Voice Dream Reader" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.voicedream.com/" target="_blank"> Voice Dream Reader</a> touted as a great option for iOS users. iOS users can also turn on<a title="VoiceOver" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https//www.apple.com/accessibility/ios/voiceover/" target="_blank"> VoiceOver</a> (go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; VoiceOver), though this affects all actions on the device (like email and web browsing) until you disable it. Amazon offers a feature for Kindle devices called<a title="Read Aloud with Voice Over" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201244940" target="_blank"> Read Aloud with Voice Over</a>. For other alternatives, search for “text to speech” or “read to me” on any of the app stores or check out the options in this post.</p> <h2><b>3. Search for troubling words</b></h2> <p>All writers have specific words and phrases that (which?) always cause them to (too?) second-guess whether (weather?) they’re (their?) using them correctly. If you know what your (you’re?) troubling words are, use your word processor’s search function to locate every possible variant of that word or phrase.</p> <p>To help you consider what your troubling words might be, here’s a good starting list, excerpted from the first chapter of <a title="Grammar Girl's Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805088318/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0805088318&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=O3ZOHEL7MZH33D7W" target="_blank"><i>Grammar Girl’s Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing</i></a>:</p> <ul> <li>a lot/alot</li> <li>affect/effect</li> <li>can/may</li> <li>further/farther</li> <li>good/well</li> <li>i.e./e.g.</li> <li>into/in to</li> <li>it’s/its</li> <li>lay/lie</li> <li>less/fewer</li> <li>that/who</li> <li>their/they’re/there</li> <li>then/than</li> <li>who/whom</li> <li>your/you’re</li> </ul> <p>If you’re unsure of how to properly use these words, there’s no shame in looking them up.<a title="Grammar Girl" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~grammargirl.com" target="_blank"> Grammar Girl</a> likely has the answer, or check The Write Life’s post on <a title="25 Editing Tips for Tightening Your Copy" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/edit-your-copy/" target="_blank">25 Editing Tips for Tightening Your Copy</a> for invaluable tips.</p> <h2><b>4. Remove or replace your crutch words</b></h2> <p>Do you know the Top 10 words you use most frequently in your manuscript? Outside of necessary articles and prepositions, <b>you may be surprised at what words you tend to use over and over.</b> One client of mine used “suddenly” too often, making every action seem unnecessarily rushed. Personally, my crutch words tend to fly in the face of the age-old encouragement for all writers to “eschew obfuscation.” In other words, I tend to cash in ten-dollar words when five-cent words suffice.</p> <p>Scrivener makes it simple to discover your crutch words, and is available for both <a title="Scrivener for Mac" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~store.esellerate.net/a.asp?c=1_SKU81634174866_AFL9074343438&amp;at=post" target="_blank">Mac</a> and <a title="Scrivener for Windows" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~store.esellerate.net/a.asp?c=1_SKU82916413320_AFL9074343438&amp;at=post" target="_blank">Windows</a> users. In Scrivener’s top menu, go to “Project &gt; Text Statistics,” then click on the arrow next to “Word frequency.” If necessary, click the “Frequency” header twice to sort your words by frequency. You’ll then be presented with what could be a jarring list of the words you might be overusing. (To include your entire manuscript in the frequency count, be sure to have your entire manuscript selected in Scrivener’s Binder.)</p> <p>For Microsoft Word users, there’s a free<a title="Word Usage and Frequency add-in" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/word_usage_and_frequency_report.html" target="_blank"> Word Usage and Frequency add-in</a>, but other, less technical online solutions may also help, like<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~textfixer.com"> TextFixer.com</a><a title="TextFixer.com’s Online Word Counter" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.textfixer.com/tools/online-word-counter.php" target="_blank">’s Online Word Counter</a> or<a title="WriteWords’ Word Frequency Counter" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.writewords.org.uk/word_count.asp" target="_blank"> WriteWords’ Word Frequency Counter</a>.</p> <p>No matter how you determine your crutch words, go back through your manuscript and see where you can remove or replace them.</p> <h2><b>5. Remove all double spaces at the end of sentences</b></h2> <p>If tapping two spaces following your sentences is an age-old habit ingrained into you since before the dawn of modern digital typography, may I suggest ingraining another practice?</p> <p><b>Conduct a find-and-replace search after you’re done writing.</b> In Word, type two spaces in “find” and one space in “replace” and hit enter. Voila! You just time-traveled your manuscript into the 21st Century. (If you’re interested in why you should only use one space, read Slate’s <a title="Space Invaders: Why you should never, ever use two spaces after a period" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/01/space_invaders.html" target="_blank">Space Invaders: Why you should never, ever use two spaces after a period</a>.)</p> <h2><b>6. Search for problematic punctuation</b></h2> <p>Are you a comma chameleon, adapting that otherwise innocent punctuation mark to do work it was never meant to do? Or does your manuscript need a semicolonoscopy &#8212; a thorough checkup on proper semicolon and colon placement?</p> <p>If you know you have trouble with certain punctuation marks, conduct a search for that mark and figure out whether you’re using it correctly. If you’re still unsure, let your editor fix it, but make a note to ask him why.</p> <h2><b>7. Run spell check</b></h2> <p>I think writers become too accustomed to the colorful squiggles under words and sentences on their digital pages; I know I do. In an effort to get ideas on the page, we might run rampant over grammar and usage.</p> <p>Yet those squiggles mean something. At the very, <i>very</i> least, run spell check before sending your manuscript to an editor or beta reader. It’s a built-in editor that I’m not sure every writer uses to their advantage. You may not accept every recommendation, but at least you’ll save your editor some time correcting basic errors.</p> <h2><b>8. Subscribe to </b><b><i>The Chicago Manual of Style</i></b></h2> <p>When an editor returns your manuscript, they may cite particular sections of <em><a title="The Chicago Manual of Style" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html" target="_blank">The Chicago Manual of Style</a></em>. If you’re unfamiliar with this Bible of the publishing industry, you may not be aware of precisely why the editor made a certain change.</p> <p>By subscribing to CMOS (it’s only $35 a year), you’ll be able to look up issues on your own <i>before</i> sending your manuscript off to an editor or beta reader. Sure, you shouldn’t get too hung up on some of the issues (editors have their jobs for a reason), but learning more about the mechanics of writing can only help you become a better writer.</p> <p>You can also buy the hardcopy version of <a title="The Chicago Manual of Style" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226104206/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0226104206&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=V3Y5PWQ7XJO6EBQV" target="_blank"><i>The Chicago Manual of Style</i></a>, but I recommend the online version for its ease of use.</p> <h2><b>9. Format accordingly</b></h2> <p>While preferred styles may differ from one editor to the next, you can <b>show your professionalism by formatting your manuscript to conform to industry standards.</b></p> <p>Such formatting makes it easier for beta readers to consume, and editors prefer industry-standard formatting, which allows them more time to edit your actual words instead of tweaking your formatting. Here are some basic formatting tips:</p> <ul> <li>Send your manuscript as a Word document (.doc or .docx).</li> <li>Use double-spaced line spacing. If you’ve already written your book with different line spacing, select all of your text in Word, click Format &gt; Paragraph, then select “Double” in the drop down box under “Line spacing.”</li> <li>Use a single space following periods.</li> <li>Use black, 12-point, Times New Roman as the font.</li> <li>Don’t hit tab to indent paragraphs. In Word, select all of your text, then set indentation using Format &gt; Paragraph. Under “Indentation” and by “Left,” type .5. Under “Special,” choose “First line” from the drop down menu.</li> <li>The first paragraph of any chapter, after a subheader, or following a bulleted or numbered list <i>shouldn’t</i> be indented.</li> <li>Use page breaks between chapters. In Word, place the cursor at the end of a chapter, then click “Insert &gt; Break &gt; Page Break” in Word’s menu.</li> </ul> <h2><b>10. Don’t over-edit</b></h2> <p>Set aside an hour or two to go through this list with your manuscript, but be careful about over-editing. You may start seeing unnecessary trees within your forest of words, but you don’t want to raze to the ground what you’ve toiled so hard to grow.</p> <p>There’s a middle path between exhausting yourself in a vain attempt for perfection and being too lazy to run spell check. <b>Do yourself and your book a favor and self-edit, but be careful to not go overboard.</b></p> <p>If you’re creating a professional product, your self-edits shouldn’t be your last line of defense against grammatical errors. In other words, I don’t offer this post to write myself out of a job. Even in going through the self-editing steps above, you’ll still need an editor to ensure that your manuscript is as polished as possible. You will still miss errors. Plus, going through the editing process with a professional editor will help you become a better self-editor the next time you write a book.</p> <p><strong><b>Do you self-edit? Why or why not? What else do you look for when going through your manuscript before sharing it with others?</b></strong></p> <p><em>Photo by <a class="owner-name truncate" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://www.flickr.com/photos/rowdykittens/8333813651" target="_blank" data-track="attributionNameClick" data-rapid_p="33">Tammy Strobel</a> under Creative Commons</em></p> <span id="pty_trigger"></span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/self-editing-basics/">Self-Editing Basics: 10 Simple Ways to Edit Your Own Book</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com">The Write Life</a>.</p> <Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0" hspace="0" src="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/80114941/0/thewritelife">]]><![CDATA[<div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a title="Like on Facebook" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/80114941/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Share on Google+" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/80114941/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Pin it!" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/80114941/thewritelife,"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Tweet This" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/80114941/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Subscribe by RSS" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/80114941/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;</div>]]></content:encoded> 			<wfw:commentRss>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/80114941/0/thewritelife~SelfEditing-Basics-Simple-Ways-to-Edit-Your-Own-Book/feed/</wfw:commentRss> 		<slash:comments>13</slash:comments></item><item><feedburner:origLink>http://thewritelife.com/23-gifts-for-writers/</feedburner:origLink> 		<title>23 Gifts for Writers: Fun Ideas for Christmas and Chanukah</title> 		<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/80036664/0/thewritelife~Gifts-for-Writers-Fun-Ideas-for-Christmas-and-Chanukah/</link> 		<comments>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/80036664/0/thewritelife~Gifts-for-Writers-Fun-Ideas-for-Christmas-and-Chanukah/#comments</comments> 		<pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2014 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate> 		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Nicole Dieker]]></dc:creator> 				<category><![CDATA[Craft]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[gifts for writers]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[writing life]]></category> 		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://thewritelife.com/?p=4172</guid> 		<description><![CDATA[<p>Here’s our list of great gift ideas for the writer in your life.</p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/80036664/0/thewritelife~Gifts-for-Writers-Fun-Ideas-for-Christmas-and-Chanukah/">23 Gifts for Writers: Fun Ideas for Christmas and Chanukah</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://thewritelife.com">The Write Life</a>.</p> ]]><![CDATA[<div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a title="Like on Facebook" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/80036664/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Share on Google+" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/80036664/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Pin it!" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/80036664/thewritelife,http%3a%2f%2ftwlcdn.socialexis.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f11%2fScreen-Shot-2014-11-25-at-4.15.45-PM-300x196.png"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Tweet This" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/80036664/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Subscribe by RSS" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/80036664/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;</div>]]></description> 				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<input class="jpibfi" type="hidden" ><p>Don’t know what to buy for the writer in your life?

I’d love to see any of these wrapped up with my name on it this holiday season!

Laptop sticker</b></h2> <p>A writer’s laptop is often the equivalent of his or her corner office. Open that laptop up at home, at a coffee shop or on a plane, and it’s like you’ve created a pop-up workspace.</p> <p>So why not decorate that office with a fun great laptop sticker? You can get the classic <a title="Snow White Holds Apple" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HQTKFD0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00HQTKFD0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=ITR4GGILEWWJFJT4" target="_blank">Snow White Holds Apple</a> sticker for a MacBook, or find out your writer’s favorite artist and get a themed sticker, like this Scott Lava <a title="Return of the Great Showdowns" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~nuvango.com/scottcampbell/great-showdowns/11-inch-apple-macbook-air" target="_blank">Return of the Great Showdowns</a> sticker (hint hint)!</p> <h2><b>3.

Accoutrements makes a variety of writer action figures, including <a title="Jane Austen Action Figure" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H5E345C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00H5E345C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=2NDROI7R7CQL6YSM" target="_blank">Jane Austen</a>, <a title="Shakespeare Action Figure" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H5E36DW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00H5E36DW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=TPXBT7B64WDUOC3G" target="_blank">Shakespeare</a> and <a title="Edgar Allen Poe Action Figure" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GWLPXI0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00GWLPXI0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=XLQVBPI7EALCGXS4" target="_blank">Edgar Allen Poe</a>.</p> <p>Your writer will enjoy posing the figure on his or her writing desk, or, you know, making Jane Austen fight a toy dinosaur. (I’d totally do that.)</p> <h2><b>4. Fancy notebook</b></h2> <p>Chances are, your writer has a notebook that he or she carries at all times. I never let my notebook out of sight; I even put it next to me when I sleep!</p> <p>Most writers love the <a title="Moleskine" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/8883701003/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=8883701003&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=4DMQR3HAATBGDC4Y" target="_blank">classic Moleskine notebook</a>, and since it’s nicer than the run-of-the-mill legal pad, it makes a great gift.

Fancy pen</b></h2> <p>What better to go with a fancy notebook than a fancy pen? A quick trip to your local pen shop or stationery store will give you a plethora of pen options.</p> <p>Or, go the extra mile and find out which pen your writer prefers. We all have a favorite, after all. I only purchase <a title="Pilot G2 Rollerball Pens" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GAOTSW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001GAOTSW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=CVXWHNOVCSDDBRKN" target="_blank">Pilot G2 Rollerball Pens</a> for myself, so I would very much appreciate a box of those under the tree this holiday season.</p> <h2><b><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007136E0O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B007136E0O&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=4NBVQBDVDQJE353G" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4183" src="http://twlcdn.socialexis.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/skullcandy-259x300.png" alt="Best gifts for writers: Skullcandy earbuds" width="200" height="232" /></a>6. Earbuds</b></h2> <p>We all know writers who can’t work without tunes. Plugging in to Pandora, Spotify or iTunes is a great way to get things done, but it also means writers sometimes go through a pair or two of earbuds a year.</p> <p>So stuff your favorite writer’s stocking with a pair of high-quality earbuds. I swear by Skullcandy, so I’d love a pair of <a title="Skullcandy’s Ink’d 2.0 Earbud Headphones" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007136E0O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B007136E0O&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=4NBVQBDVDQJE353G" target="_blank">Skullcandy’s Ink’d 2.0 Earbud Headphones</a>.

Coffee gift card</b></h2> <p>Yes, writers love their coffee &#8212; and their coffee shops, which are often one of the best places to <a title="Is a Coworking Space Better for Freelancers Than Working from Home?" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/coworking-space-better-than-working-from-home/" target="_blank">get work done</a>. (I don’t know why. Maybe it’s the comfortable chairs, or the comfort of being surrounded by other people tapping on laptops.)</p> <p>So give your writer a <a title="Starbucks card" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AR51Y5I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00AR51Y5I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=6ETGOBETP6XCDONZ" target="_blank">Starbucks card</a> or a gift card to their favorite local coffee shop.

Right now, it’s just a dollar an issue.</p> <h2><b> 13. </b><b><i>Scratch</i></b></h2> <p><i>The New Yorker</i> is a great publication to read if you want to learn more about good writing, but <a title="Scratch" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~scratchmag.net/" target="_blank"><i>Scratch</i></a> is the publication you need to read if you want to learn more about the business of good writing.</p> <p><em>Scratch</em>, founded by Jane Friedman and Manjula Martin, releases four issues a year that deal with topics like negotiating client contracts and dealing with late payments. The magazine also includes first-person stories and interviews with writers who talk freely about the business of the writing life, including a brilliant interview with Austin Kleon that <a title="The Scratch Interview With Austin Kleon" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~scratchmag.net/article/54386065c873d9175d14a2fd/the_scratch_interview_with_austin_kleon" target="_blank">you can read right now for free</a> (by signing up for a free account).</p> <p>So give the gift of a <a title="Scratch" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://tugboatyards.com/page/scratch#givethegiftofscratch1" target="_blank"><i>Scratch</i> subscription</a> this year. It’s just $20.</p> <h2><b>14. The Unconventional Guide to Freelance Writing</b></h2> <p>I am a huge fan of Chris Guillebeau’s work, and I bought <a title="The Unconventional Guide to Freelance Writing" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~unconventionalguides.com/cmd.php?Clk=5185994" target="_blank">The Unconventional Guide to Freelance Writing</a> for myself last year. This guide is an amazing resource, and it will help your writer learn more about pitching clients, promoting work, and building a career.</p> <p>As The Write Life Assistant Editor Heather van der Hoop wrote in her <a title="Unconventional Guide to Freelance Writing: Review" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/unconventional-guide-to-freelance-writing-review/" target="_blank">review</a>, this ebook and supplementary materials will help you “stop making excuses and start building your writing business.

Give the gift of a standing desk. These desks help writers alternate between sitting and standing throughout the workday, and they promote health, burn calories, increase energy levels and prevent the development of Writer’s Butt.</p> <p>There are many different types of standing desks on the market, but it’s probably best to buy one of the simple types designed to stand on top of your writer’s existing desk. The <a title="Varidesk Pro Plus" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JI6NCCK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00JI6NCCK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=F3ETYIQQ4JRXHVWQ" target="_blank">Varidesk Pro Plus</a> is a bestseller, and is built to accommodate both laptops and traditional computers.</p> <h2><b>16. Damn Fine Words</b></h2> <p>What’s the phrase &#8212; if you give a writer a book, she reads for a day; if you give her a course, she learns for a lifetime?</p> <p>Why not give your writer the opportunity to participate in James Chartrand’s <a title="Damn Fine Words" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.menwithpens.ca/affiliates/idevaffiliate.php?id=188&amp;tid4=post" target="_blank">Damn Fine Words</a>? This course, which will open registration in February 2015 for new members, teaches students how to write compelling website copy, clickable headlines and other expert skills that will give writers a boost in the digital content world.</p> <p>Yes, it’s not something you can put in a box and wrap with a bow. But it is likely to be very much appreciated.</p> <h2><b>17. Literary T-shirts</b></h2> <p>What’s your writer’s favorite book? Chances are, there’s a shirt with that design.

Sharing your thoughts on a blog with a lot of clout in your niche will make a much bigger difference to your reputation and traffic than guest-posting on your brother’s blog that only your parents read.</p> <p>For many writers, the ultimate guest-posting goal is a mainstream authority publication such as <a title="The Huffington Post" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.huffingtonpost.com/" target="_blank">The Huffington Post</a>.

It asks for your &#8220;final or near-final draft,” which must be less than 1,000 words.</p> <h2><b>My experience blogging on The Huffington Post</b></h2> <p>My story is a little bit different; I was lucky enough to have some help. I had just published my book, <a title="101 Weird Ways to Make Money" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118014189/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1118014189&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=REMSQS5RY7CGRRKS" target="_blank"><i>101 Weird Ways to Make Money</i></a>, and my publisher’s publicist arranged for me to create an article and slideshow for The Huffington Post on<a title="10 Weird Jobs You Can Turn Into Businesses" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-gillman/10-weird-jobs-you-can-tur_b_926954.html" target="_blank"> weird jobs that can become businesses</a>.</p> <p>In that article, I linked to <a title="Every Way to Make Money" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.everywaytomakemoney.com" target="_blank">my website</a>, which had been seeing between 700 and 1,000 page views and earning between $12 and $30 daily through Google AdSense, with an average of $20 per day.</p> <p>Here’s the traffic and revenue I earned the day the article ran (Monday, August 15, 2011) and the following days:</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4196" src="http://twlcdn.socialexis.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-25-at-5.29.05-PM.png" alt="Huffington Post blog traffic" width="293" height="178" /></p> <p>After Thursday, the numbers resumed their normal range, though my traffic stayed slightly higher, with 1,200 to 1,500 daily page views. But revenue of $531, instead of the $80 I would normally have earned in four days, suggests <b>the traffic from The Huffington Post link was worth at least $450</b>. Not bad for one post!</p> <p>In addition, my website includes links to several of my other sites, so I&#8217;m sure I picked up another $50 worth of indirect traffic for those sites. And I linked to my book in the article and author bio, so I sold quite a few copies that week.</p> <p><b>All together, that article and slideshow on The Huffington Post was probably worth $800 in additional income within a few days</b>. In addition, it helped me attract visitors to my sites and promote sales of my book for several months.</p> <p>It was a (very busy) year before I realized I had not just a post, but my own blog set up on The Huffington Post. I requested my password and started posting occasionally. The results were never as dramatic as that first post, but I did see increased traffic and book sales. And best of all, the editors never objected to my posts containing relevant links to my own websites.</p> <h2><b>How to Earn Money by Writing for Free</b></h2> <p>While The Huffington Post does not generally pay its bloggers, as my experience demonstrates, it’s still possible to earn cash by writing for free. Here are the strategies I used:</p> <h3>Include specific, valuable links</h3> <p>To start, <b>be strategic when choosing links to include in your author bio.</b> For example, if you’ve written a book or created a course, link to that. If you’re a freelance writer, you&#8217;ll want to link to your <a title="An Online Portfolio Can Change Your Career: 10 Writer Websites We Love" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/writer-websites/" target="_blank">writer website</a> or <a title="7 Great Portfolio Sites for Freelance Writers (And Most are Free)" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/freelance-portfolio-sites/" target="_blank">online portfolio</a>. If you’ve monetized a website with affiliate products or pay-per-click advertising, link to it.</p> <p>In addition, if any of these links are relevant to your post’s content, include them on related anchor text in the body of your post. I’ll reiterate: the links must be <i>relevant</i>. If they’re not, the editors will likely remove them.</p> <h3>Aim for the front page</h3> <p>For these links to be valuable, a lot of people need to see and click them, which means you&#8217;ll need a lot of readers. I was a extremely lucky with my first post; it was featured on the front page of the <a title="HuffPost Small Business" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.huffingtonpost.com/small-business/" target="_blank">HuffPost Small Business</a> section, which brought in a ton of readers. Later posts never approached that level of traffic.</p> <p>With these results in mind, it can’t hurt to aim for this special treatment. Look at what&#8217;s being shared on your targeted section&#8217;s front page. Are the featured articles controversial or fun? Are they short or long? Do they have shocking titles?</p> <p>Many big names blog on The Huffington Post, so competition for better placement is tough. When former Secretary of Labor<a title="Robert Reich" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-reich/" target="_blank"> Robert Reich&#8217;s post</a> is on the front page of the Politics section, yours isn&#8217;t likely to push his aside. On the other hand, he doesn&#8217;t write every day. If you’re working in a section with fewer big names, you might have an even better chance to get a good post featured. Study your targeted section to learn the famous bloggers in your niche and how often they post.</p> <h3>Share your post as much as possible</h3> <p>Promote your post to your own networks to direct as much traffic to it as possible, as you would with any guest post. Share it with your Facebook and Twitter followers, write a short blurb about it on your blog or email it to your newsletter subscribers.</p> <p>With a bit of luck, your HuffPo post might even go viral. Blogger <a title="How to Get a Blog Post Published on The Huffington Post" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.carefulcents.com/get-published-on-the-huffington-post/" target="_blank">Catherine Alford</a> was lucky enough to see her recent post blow up:</p> <blockquote><p><i>[It] went hugely viral with more than 220,000 likes and 43,000+ shares. That viral post also led to me getting interviewed on Huffington Post Live, which led to tons of emails and new readers. There’s no doubt that it’s beneficial to any writing career to be an author there.</i></p></blockquote> <p>Whether or not your post goes viral, you’ll at least point a few new readers toward your site and offerings and add &#8220;Huffington Post Blogger&#8221; to your resume.</p> <p><strong><b>If you’ve been published on The Huffington Post, how did you do it and what results did you see?

I’ve detailed the importance of an <a title="Author Platform: Here’s What All the Fuss Is About" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/author-platform/" target="_blank">author platform</a> before on The Write Life, and highlighted the fact that it’s not all about social media.</p> <p>In reading through the comments, and in my everyday work with authors, I’ve noticed that many writers aren’t sure how exactly to get started. <b>What should you focus on when you’re being pointed in 20 different directions</b>, and all roads are potentially huge time sucks?</p> <p>In that post, I broke down author platform into the following components: expertise, contacts, social media, previous media, previous books, personality, existing readership and ability to execute. That breakdown also functions as a roadmap for anyone who’s trying to figure out how to get started, especially if you feel like you’re starting at zero.</p> <p>Ready to build your author platform? Here’s how to start from scratch.</p> <h2><b>1. Expertise: Write an “I am fabulous” statement</b></h2> <p>The goal with this step is to pump yourself up. In what specific and particular ways are you awesome? Why are you the person to write your book? Why is it the case that <a title="Why the Book Chooses the Writer — Not the Other Way Around" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/why-the-book-chooses-the-writer/" target="_blank">no one but you</a> could write your book? <b>What unique experience do you bring to the table?</b></p> <p>Even if your answer is simply that you lived the life you lived &#8212; and maybe it was a hard one &#8212; you’re awesome for having survived it. If you write fiction, your book likely involves themes or situations you know a lot about, which makes you an expert.</p> <p>Let your statement be free-flowing, but work hard to pat yourself on the back. <b>While many of us tend to undervalue our abilities,</b> <b>the first step toward being an expert is believing that you can be an expert.</b> You may have to fake it till you make it, and your “I am fabulous” statement can give you the motivation and validation you need to get there.</p> <h2><b>2. Contacts: Put together a “big mouth list”</b></h2> <p>Everyone you know is a contact. The more people you know, the more influence you have, especially if you know people in high places.</p> <p>So what if those influencers are a couple degrees of separation from you? People are surprising in how they choose to support fledgling authors. I’ve witnessed seriously established authors supporting new writers just because it feels good, and they remember what it’s like to be in your position.</p> <p>In addition to the list of people you’re connected to, create a list of people who might blurb you, from realistic to pie in the sky. Who would be your ideal reader? Who do you dream might one day recommend your book?</p> <h2><b>3. Social media: Pick two social channels</b></h2> <p>That’s right: only two. Set up a profile on each and post once a day.</p> <p>For most writers, I recommend choosing Facebook and Twitter, but if you’re into other channels or options, give them a shot. If you’re writing something that lends itself to images, join Pinterest. If your work lends itself to video, do YouTube. Experiment to find a <a title="Yes, Fiction Writers Can Develop Awesome Online Platforms, Too" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/yes-fiction-writers-can-develop-awesome-online-platforms-too/" target="_blank">social media channel</a> that works for you and your writing.</p> <p><b>The key to <a title="How Successful Authors Use Social Media to Sell More Books" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/how-successful-authors-use-social-media-to-sell-more-books/" target="_blank">social media</a> is posting regularly and engaging people.</b> You want shares, because shares lead to more follows. Rather than spreading yourself thin across multiple platforms, focus consistently on the two platforms that <a title="Get the Biggest Bang for Your Social Media Buck" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/get-the-biggest-bang-for-your-social-media-buck/" target="_blank">provide the most value</a> to you and your work.</p> <p>It takes forever (seriously) to build up a following on social media, so don’t be discouraged. Celebrate a few likes a week. Manage your expectations. Keep going. <b>Building an author platform is a marathon, not a sprint. </b></p> <div class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%E2%80%9CBuilding+an+author+platform+is+a+marathon%2C+not+a+sprint%2C%E2%80%9D+says+%40brooke_warner&via=thewritelife&related=thewritelife&url=http://thewritelife.com/build-author-platform-7-manageable-ways-start-scratch/&naytev_force=true' target='_blank'>“Building an author platform is a marathon, not a sprint,” says @brooke_warner</a></span><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%E2%80%9CBuilding+an+author+platform+is+a+marathon%2C+not+a+sprint%2C%E2%80%9D+says+%40brooke_warner&via=thewritelife&related=thewritelife&url=http://thewritelife.com/build-author-platform-7-manageable-ways-start-scratch/&naytev_force=true' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'>Click To Tweet</a></div> <h2><b>4. Previous media and books: Publish an ebook</b></h2> <p>If you’re starting at zero, you may not have any previously published books or media, like guest posts or podcast interviews. That’s okay.</p> <p>If you’re working on a book project that you know is going to take some time to complete &#8212; a novel or a memoir that’s already been in progress for a few years, for instance &#8212; then write a shorter ebook!</p> <p>It’s surprisingly easy to <a title="What You Should Know Before Publishing Your First Ebook" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/what-you-should-know-before-publishing-your-first-ebook/" target="_blank">self-publish an ebook</a>. You want it to be high quality, with great content, a compelling cover and a well-designed interior. Using Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, Kobo, iBooks, or e-junkie you can promote and sell your ebook from your website. While marketing your ebook is a topic for another post, shepherding a short ebook to publication is a fairly simple process. And voila, you have a book to propel future books.</p> <p>Media opportunities will come, but any interview you do, blog post you write or opportunity to speak in front of people you come across qualifies as media. <b>Don’t be afraid to showcase these successes on your website and social media channels.</b></p> <p>It takes a major shift in consciousness to start <a title="5 Marketing Strategies for Writers Who Hate Promoting Their Own Work" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/marketing-strategies-for-writers/" target="_blank">self-promoting</a>, but I’ve found the key is in the balance. It’s cool to self-promote if you’re giving your readership fantastic, smart and interesting content &#8212; <a title="The One Big Reason Some Blogs Succeed, While Others Crash and Burn" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/one-big-reason-blogs-succeed/" target="_blank">providing value</a>. And it will get more comfortable with practice, I promise.</p> <h2><b>5. Personality: Figure out your persona</b></h2> <p>Jeff VanderMeer’s <a title="Booklife: Strategies and Survivial Tips for the 21st-Century Writer: Jeff VanderMeer" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/1892391902/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1892391902&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=LP3L4BKJDBC6FXUU" target="_blank"><i>Booklife</i></a> helped me understand the value of figuring out who you are online.</p> <p>Some people put it all out there and are wholly themselves online, while others choose to <a title="How One Author Learned to Love Social Media (After Really, Truly Hating It)" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/how-one-author-learned-to-love-social-media/" target="_blank">create a persona</a> different from who they are in real life or only show a certain side of themselves. You get to decide, and you’re not wrong or weird or bad if you want to retain a little privacy.</p> <p>However, <b>being private or an introvert does </b><b><i>not</i></b><b> mean you should not have a website, or that you can get away with pooh-poohing the importance of an author platform.</b> It just means you get to set boundaries. Instead of holding technology in contempt, learn to work with what you might not like, and to figure out how to make it work for you.</p> <h2><b>6. Existing readership: Create a sign-up form on your website</b></h2> <p>What? You don’t have a <a title="Without This, You’ll Never Succeed as a Writer" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/without-this-youll-never-succeed-as-a-writer/" target="_blank">website</a> yet? OK, the first step is to set up your new site.</p> <p>While you’re at it, create a sign-up form that connects to an email management system like <a title="Send Better Email | MailChimp" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~eepurl.com/Pvrg1" target="_blank">MailChimp</a> or <a title="Email Marketing Services - iContact" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.icontact.com/" target="_blank">iContact</a>. Put it on your homepage (or if you’re feeling fancy, a <a title="What is a Landing Page? A Fast Way to Grow Your Blog and Business" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/landing-page/" target="_blank">landing page</a>) to capture email addresses &#8212; and take a deep breath.</p> <p>Authors often tell me that people they know already have too much email. Get over it. Seriously. Your job is to collect emails, and to send out worthwhile content. It may take a long time to build up your email list, and to figure out exactly what your message is, but you need to practice having a following.</p> <p><b>It doesn’t matter if you launch your email list with 20 people on it. That’s exactly what I did, and four years later I’m publishing for 5,000 subscribers</b> who want to hear from me. After all, if they don’t, they can opt out.</p> <p>But don’t worry about the numbers for now. Just take the first step and set up the form.</p> <h2><b>7. Ability to execute: Stick to a schedule </b></h2> <p>The ability to execute, like personality, is sort of a “soft” aspect of author platform, but it matters. It’s about follow-through and the ability to stick to a commitment to create content. It’s about consistency, and showing up even if it seems like no one is listening.</p> <p>Building an author platform is grueling work, but it’s truly rewarding when you see the occasional spikes in engagement or new followers, or the payoff in the form of positive feedback or sales.</p> <p>This payoff can only happen if you execute a plan and stick to it.</p> <p>I <i>know</i> it’s a long haul. I’m out there myself, working on my platform every day, sometimes wondering why I am putting so much effort toward all this personal branding. But if you want to publish, and if you want readers, you have to find a voice, write content, connect with your readers and put yourself out there.</p> <p>Your hard work will pay off; it just takes some time. <b>Give it time and figure out a schedule that works for you.</b> I recommend blogging once a month and posting on social media once a day, to start. You might increase from there, but again, you can take it little by little and adjust your plan as you figure it out.</p> <h2><b>What I know about author platform</b></h2> <p>Just like you don’t run a marathon without training for weeks or months, you don’t start your author platform full force. Building your platform takes discipline and hard work, but if it weren’t worth it, no one would be doing it.</p> <p>The key is to find genuine value in your endeavors. Keep going, even when it feels like no one is listening. Eventually people will start to listen, and eventually you will get a comment to a post that makes you realize you’re making a difference, reach a milestone with your contacts that surprises you, or connect with a high-profile writer who supports you just because.</p> <p>Have faith. Work hard. Don’t dismiss these ideas just because they feel like too much effort, or because starting from zero seems daunting. <b>Everyone started from zero, even your literary heroes.</b> And it’s only with hindsight and effort that anyone has the wisdom to promise that it’s worth it.</p> <p>I promise, it is. Come on in and test the waters. Wade in slowly. You’ll find your way.</p> <p><b>What was the first thing you did to build your author platform?

When I started my career as a freelance writer and journalist over a decade ago from India, I followed the advice of the U.S.-based writers that had come before me and tried to emulate their strategies.</p> <p>I learned how to write <a title="Pitching a Guest Post? 7 Ways to Stand Out in an Editor's Inbox" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/pitching-guest-posts/" target="_blank">great queries and pitches</a>, I practiced brainstorming specific and targeted story ideas, and I found myself a few informal mentors who would answer questions and offer support. I downplayed the fact that I was in India.</p> <p>Despite all this, my career stagnated, and I didn’t know why.</p> <p>To shake things up, I started experimenting with my approach. <b>Instead of hiding that I was based in New Delhi, India, I started positioning it as a unique advantage.</b> Within a year, I had landed assignments from <i>The New York Times, TIME, Global Post, Marie Claire, </i>and<i> Ms. Magazine</i>.</p> <p>As <a title="Live Anywhere as a Freelance Writer: How to Create a Location-Independent Career" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/freelance-writer-location-independent-career/" target="_blank">a writer based outside of the U.S.</a>, I needed to use slightly different strategies than my peers in those countries. Here’s how to use what I learned to advance your own career as an international freelancer.</p> <h2><b>1. Highlight who you are and what you’ve done</b></h2> <p>Let me be clear: It’s <i>essential</i> that you focus on your prospect’s needs, be that a corporate client or an editor at a regional magazine. Figure out exactly <a title="A Step-by-Step Guide for Going After Clients You Really Want" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/going-after-clients-you-really-want/" target="_blank">what your client needs</a> so you can create the perfect pitch.</p> <p>However, the problem with pitching from India, China, Costa Rica, Nigeria and other countries is that many editors won’t even look at your story ideas until you’ve convinced them of your professionalism. Perhaps they’ve been burned before, or they simply don’t trust someone they can’t easily reach should something go wrong.</p> <p>As an international writer, often you’re going to need to prove your capability more than an American writer would. <b>Your credits, <a title="7 Great Portfolio Sites for Freelance Writers (And Most are Free)" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/freelance-portfolio-sites/" target="_blank">portfolio</a> and experience can go a long way in opening these doors.</b> When you’re writing a query or a Letter of Introduction, make sure to focus on who you are and why you’re the right person for the job.</p> <p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/jobs" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4072 size-full" src="http://twlcdn.socialexis.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/The-Write-Life-Job-Board.png" alt="Writing jobs on The Write Life" width="415" height="140" /></a></p> <h2><b>2. Ask if they’d like to chat over Skype or the phone</b></h2> <p>One of the best things I ever did for my career as an international freelancer was getting on the phone.</p> <p>Living so far away from many of them, it was almost a given that I’d never meet my editors. However, being able to see someone, connect with them and have a laugh or two can help cement a relationship &#8212; and potentially lead to more work (or at least more email responses).</p> <p><b>So I did the next best thing: I asked if we could Skype </b>or chat over the phone. Even if an editor doesn’t take you up on your offer, asking the question can make you seem accessible and not quite as remote as travel-wary editors might think.</p> <h2><b>3. Don’t put your phone number or address on your website</b></h2> <p>This is a bit of a controversial point, but in my experience, funny or unpronounceable regional names and unfamiliar area codes can scare off people who aren’t used to working internationally.</p> <p>If your clients are international editors at major magazines and newspapers and like the idea of finding people in remote places, you might not need to worry about this advice. However, if you write about health or are looking exclusively for small business clients, your specific location can be a deterrent.</p> <p><b>If your location has no relevance to your work, leave out the specifics.</b> This advice might even hold true for writers living in remote parts of the U.S. or U.K.; you can be just as professional a writer living on a farm in Wisconsin as you would be in New York City.</p> <h2><b>4. Have an awesome website and online presence</b></h2> <p>Until a prospective client or editor hires you or agrees to talk to you over the phone, the only thing they have to judge you by is your website.</p> <p><a title="An Online Portfolio Can Change Your Career: 10 Writer Websites We Love" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/writer-websites" target="_blank">Your website</a> must shine. It needs to say, “Hey you, undecided over there in the corner, here are the 10 different ways in which I’m the perfect writer for you. Click that button and hire me right now.”</p> <p>Whether you have a static site or a blog, an active <a title="Get the Biggest Bang for Your Social Media Buck" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/get-the-biggest-bang-for-your-social-media-buck/" target="_blank">social media presence</a> or a small one, make sure it reflects your professionalism and skill as a writer.</p> <h2><b>5. Make sure you show up in Google searches</b></h2> <p>In 2006, quite by accident, my website started showing up as the number one search result on Google for “freelance journalist India.” At the time, I didn’t realize the significance of this accomplishment, especially since I hadn’t been trying to optimize for keywords. What happened next forever changed the way I look at my website.</p> <p>Editors from high-profile media outlets, such as <i>US Weekly, ABC News, Marie Claire, NPR, Cosmopolitan</i> and more, found my website while searching for freelance journalists to cover stories in my region. I’ve been contacted by NYC literary agents, by government departments, even by a political campaign (I politely declined).</p> <p>The lesson? SEO is crucial. Make sure you show up in Google searches related to your city, country or region (and of course, that the search history is mostly positive). You never know when an overworked editor will need a writer familiar with your area.</p> <h2><b>6. Focus on building a portfolio of online work</b></h2> <p>At least initially, write for publications with online archives or clickable links.</p> <p>Early in my career, I neglected to focus enough on online publications. Even though I’d been published in some impressive publications and had over 100 bylines after my first year in the business, I had no proof: Much of my work was in local publications and wasn’t available online. I’d been published in 20+ countries, but editors had no way of verifying that.</p> <p>Make sure your work will be shared online, or find another way to share high-quality images of your work in your portfolio.</p> <h2><b>7.   Add humor and personality to your communications</b></h2> <p>Your emails, your website, your About page: all are opportunities to showcase that despite the differences in nationalities and location, you’re pretty much a person with the same needs, wants and desires as your editor.</p> <p>Your U.S.-based clients might often feel that they have nothing in common with you because you live in a place they’ve only ever seen on the news. Make yourself vulnerable, share a glimpse into your life and show them what you’re really like. Find something that helps you create a connection and a bond, like a shared hobby or interest.</p> <p><b>What do you do differently as a freelancer based outside the U.S.?</b></p> <span id="pty_trigger"></span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/7-ways-freelancers-outside-u-s-can-stand-land-writing-job/">7 Ways Freelancers Outside the U.S. Can Stand Out and Land More Writing Jobs</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com">The Write Life</a>.</p> <Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0" hspace="0" src="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/79495814/0/thewritelife">]]><![CDATA[<div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a title="Like on Facebook" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/79495814/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Share on Google+" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/79495814/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Pin it!" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/79495814/thewritelife,http%3a%2f%2ftwlcdn.socialexis.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f09%2fThe-Write-Life-Job-Board.png"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Tweet This" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/79495814/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Subscribe by RSS" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/79495814/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;</div>]]></content:encoded> 			<wfw:commentRss>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/79495814/0/thewritelife~Ways-Freelancers-Outside-the-US-Can-Stand-Out-and-Land-More-Writing-Jobs/feed/</wfw:commentRss> 		<slash:comments>16</slash:comments></item><item><feedburner:origLink>http://thewritelife.com/5-lessons-j-school-will-make-better-writer/</feedburner:origLink> 		<title>5 Lessons From J-School That Will Make You a Better Writer</title> 		<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/79204944/0/thewritelife~Lessons-From-JSchool-That-Will-Make-You-a-Better-Writer/</link> 		<comments>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/79204944/0/thewritelife~Lessons-From-JSchool-That-Will-Make-You-a-Better-Writer/#comments</comments> 		<pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2014 10:00:28 +0000</pubDate> 		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Tanner Nemkov]]></dc:creator> 				<category><![CDATA[Craft]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[education]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[getting started]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[j-school]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[journalism]]></category> 		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://thewritelife.com/?p=4004</guid> 		<description><![CDATA[<p>Considering journalism school?

While I considered switching to a new major, journalism taught me many lessons about both writing and life, and I’m glad I stuck with it. While I now focus more on marketing and PR and won’t be breaking the next presidential scandal, my experience in journalism school was invaluable in shaping me as a writer.</p> <p>Considering attending a journalism program? Here are the top things I learned in J-school.</p> <h2><b>1.</b><b>  </b><b>The worst possible mistake is a factual error</b></h2> <p>At Northwestern’s Medill School, the “Medill F” is infamous &#8212; it even has its own <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://twitter.com/TheMedillF">Twitter account</a>. Anytime a journalism student makes a factual error, he or she automatically fails the assignment.</p> <p>Getting the facts straight is crucial. <b>As a journalist </b>(or marketer, communicator or advertiser), <b>you’re only as good as your last story</b> (or Tweet, blog post or press release). If you make mistakes when it comes to the facts, you’ll be sacrificing your reputation.</p> <p>The Medill F taught me to review and fact-check my work a extra time <a title="Feel Nervous About Submitting Your Writing? Why That’s a Good Thing" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/feel-nervous-submitting-writing-thats-good-thing/" target="_blank">before submitting it</a>. It might take a little longer, but consistently providing high-quality, accurate work makes clients happy &#8212; and more likely to refer me to their contacts.</p> <h2><b>2.</b> <b>A strong knowledge of AP Style and grammar is invaluable</b></h2> <p>In the journalism industry, adherence to Associated Press (AP) Style reaches religious levels, and the <a title="AP Stylebook" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://www.apstylebook.com/" target="_blank">AP Stylebook</a> is basically a journalist’s holy book. Because of this fervor, journalism school subjected me to class after class of grueling style and grammar training, but I wouldn’t take back one second.</p> <p>Think writing AM instead of a.m. won’t make a difference? Think again &#8212; unless you’re referencing the radio frequency. <b>A firm knowledge of the <a title="25 Editing Tips for Tightening Your Copy" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/edit-your-copy/" target="_blank">rules of writing</a> helps professional writers differentiate themselves from the amateurs and impress clients.</b> Study, practice and hone your skills.</p> <p>While different clients will require you to follow different style guides (such as MLA, Chicago, APA or an in-house guide), understanding and sticking to their preferred guide demonstrates your attention to detail &#8212; and that helps you stand out as a writer to re-hire.</p> <h2><b>3.</b><b>  </b><b>Journalists are people too, and people make mistakes</b></h2> <p>Factual errors are considered unforgivable sins by some (see “Medill F”), but other journalistic errors are excusable at times. Once, I recorded a great interview on my camera &#8212; only to discover that its memory card was full. Another time, my dog <i>actually</i> ate my interview notes.</p> <p>While it may be horribly embarrassing to have to ask a source to repeat an interview, more often than not, people are understanding and accommodating. <b>Messing up once in a while is not the end of the world</b> and it doesn’t mean you’re a <a title="How Fear of Failure Keeps Writers From Producing Their Best Work" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/fear-of-failure/" target="_blank">failure</a>. (Just make sure you learn from your mistakes so you don’t repeat them!)</p> <h2><b>4.</b><b>  </b><b>Journalism is not for the timid, awkward or fearful</b></h2> <p>Journalists are notorious for being nosy, pushy and relentless, but this is how some of the best stories are told. As a measly freshman who’d get nervous interviewing his own mom, I learned quickly that the best stories take some nudging (and sometimes, a little bravado).</p> <p>For one project, I chronicled the start of the season for Northwestern’s successful women’s lacrosse team. I wanted footage of a certain early morning boxing workout, but video equipment was not <i>officially</i> allowed into the gym. Regardless, I went to the practice and confidently set up my equipment, though I was nervous. While the gym owner was displeased and clearly wished I wasn’t there, I explained I was capturing footage for a school project and would be out of the way within a few hours. He let me stay. At times, <a title="How I Broke Out of a Freelancing Slump by Breaking All the Rules" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.therenegadewriter.com/2014/09/30/freelancing-breaking-all-the-rules/" target="_blank">breaking the rules</a> pays off.</p> <p>When a source is slow to respond or flat-out rude, persistence is the key to getting that dream interview. Be friendly and gracious, but follow up consistently to pursue the conversation or information you need.</p> <h2><b>5.</b><b>  </b><b>The human connection is paramount</b></h2> <p>Sometimes journalists (and freelance writers) spend hours crafting the perfect set of interview questions only to have them dashed minutes into the interview. Though it may feel like you just wasted your time, you’ve actually stumbled onto something more valuable.</p> <p>When you truly connect with someone you’re talking to and the conversation takes on a life of its own, that person becomes more than an interview source. After all, <b>the point of journalism is to tell a story, and the best way to do so is to get lost in a conversation.</b></p> <p>During my junior year, I planned to do a story about senior citizens and the holiday season. I talked to my first sources during Thanksgiving break, and while we started talking about the holidays, the attack on Pearl Harbor came up because that too was toward the end of the year &#8212; and I quickly realized that year would be the 70th anniversary.</p> <p>Our conversation turned from the holidays to memories of Pearl Harbor and what life was like at the time, as well as what my sources learned from the event and how they thought times had changed. Had I stuck to my original plan, I would have missed an incredible opportunity to tell a great story.</p> <p><strong><b>Have you attended or considered attending journalism school?

Create a do-it-yourself writing retreat.</p> <h2><b>Why should you take a DIY writing retreat?</b></h2> <p>Making your own time and <a title="Writing Spaces: Where 9 Famous Creatives Do Their Best Work" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/writing-spaces-9-famous-creatives-best-work/" target="_blank">space to write</a> is a shortcut to many of the benefits of attending a writing residency or retreat. Although a DIY writing retreat doesn’t have the prestige factor of places like <a title="Jentel" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.jentelarts.org/" target="_blank">Jentel</a> and <a title="Hedgebrook" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://www.hedgebrook.org/" target="_blank">Hedgebrook</a>, you’ll still find immense value in setting aside a few whole days to write.</p> <p>Here are five reasons you should take yourself on a writing retreat:</p> <h3><b>1. You want time to write</b></h3> <p>Maybe the day-to-day hustle is getting in the way: you just can’t drop everything and write.</p> <p>It’s hard to separate out time for your writing! A writing retreat gives you at least a few hours of quiet, peaceful writing time. It can help you build your <a title="Hit the Wall? 8 Marathon Training Tips for Writing Stamina" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.makealivingwriting.com/marathon-training-tips-build-writing-stamina/" target="_blank">writing stamina</a> and even jump-start a <a title="Write Every Day: How to Meet Your Daily Writing Goals" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/daily-writing-goals/" target="_blank">daily writing plan</a>, which you can take back to your regular life.</p> <h3><b>2. You need structure</b></h3> <p>If you schedule your writing retreat ahead of time, down to the hour, you won’t have time to think about what you “should” be doing. <b>You’ll be doing it.</b></p> <h3><b>3. You don’t know what to write</b></h3> <p>Just finished a project and not sure what to try next? A writing retreat will force you to pick a direction &#8212; any direction &#8212; and just write.</p> <p><b>Try using prompts or test out a totally new genre or style.</b> If you’ve just finished the first draft of a mystery novel, try writing a <a title="So You Want to Write a Picture Book for Children?" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/write-picture-book/" target="_blank">children’s picture book</a>. Focused on blogging? Write the first few chapters of that <a title="The Beginner’s Guide to Planning and Writing a Memoir" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/the-beginners-guide-to-planning-and-writing-a-memoir/" target="_blank">memoir</a> you’ve been thinking about.</p> <h3><b>4.You’ve had a project sitting on the back burner for far too long</b></h3> <p>Going on a writing retreat will force you to set goals and work towards them. It gives you the headspace to take a good hard look at your project and finally get down to brass tacks. You <i>have</i> to make progress, because that project is all you’re going to focus on for the length of your retreat.</p> <h3><b>5. You’ve always wanted to feel like a <a title="When Can You Call Yourself A Writer?" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/call-yourself-a-writer/" target="_blank">real writer</a></b></h3> <p>Want to know who goes on writing retreats? Writers!</p> <h2><b>How to create a DIY writing retreat</b></h2> <p>Taking yourself on a writing retreat doesn’t have to be complicated. It can be as simple as kicking your family out of the house for an afternoon and writing at the kitchen table. But to truly get into the retreat mindset, you’re going to need a few things:</p> <ul> <li><b>A change of scenery:</b> Try to go somewhere new, even if it’s just your garage. Giving yourself a break from your usual routine will put you in the right frame of mind to explore.</li> <li><b>A goal:</b> Don’t just say “I’m going to write” &#8212; you need a <a title="3 Steps for Creating Meaningful Goals That Will Help You Make Progress as a Writer" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/3-steps-for-creating-meaningful-goals/" target="_blank">specific, measurable goal</a>. Do you want to just get words on the page? Give yourself a page or word count to hit. Do you want to finish a project? Break it down and aim to finish next step &#8212; a chapter, scene or article.</li> <li><b>A plan:</b> Don’t pretend you will write for four hours straight &#8212; everyone needs a snack! Write out a schedule for yourself, including coffee breaks and time to relax.</li> </ul> <div class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=DIY+writing+retreat%3A+you+need+a+goal%2C+a+plan+%26amp%3B+a+chance+of+scenery%2C+says+%40likesoatmeal&via=thewritelife&related=thewritelife&url=http://thewritelife.com/want-reach-writing-goals-try-diy-writing-retreat/&naytev_force=true' target='_blank'>DIY writing retreat: you need a goal, a plan &amp; a chance of scenery, says @likesoatmeal</a></span><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=DIY+writing+retreat%3A+you+need+a+goal%2C+a+plan+%26amp%3B+a+chance+of+scenery%2C+says+%40likesoatmeal&via=thewritelife&related=thewritelife&url=http://thewritelife.com/want-reach-writing-goals-try-diy-writing-retreat/&naytev_force=true' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'>Click To Tweet</a></div> <h3><b>Plan ahead to avoid distractions</b></h3> <p>The hardest thing for many people is disconnecting. If you know you’ll be distracted by email, leave your phone in the car and turn off your computer’s Wi-fi.</p> <p>If you’re worried you’ll want to run errands, head to a new town. Don’t go somewhere where you’ll run into neighbors; instead of the local coffee shop, try a coffee shop in a different neighborhood or the library at your local community college.</p> <p>Once you’ve found a writing hideout, write your goal on a piece of paper and tape it above your writing space or in your notebook. If you’re in a coffee shop or another noisy place, put on headphones or retreat to a quieter corner.</p> <h3><b>Remember to take breaks</b></h3> <p>After you’ve spent about an hour writing, give yourself a short break outside your writing space. <b>Don’t think about how much you’ve done or how far you are toward your goal</b>; instead, enjoy the chance to dedicate time to writing. After your break, head back to your writing space for another hour or so. If you’re feeling good, feel free to write more! If not, try <a title="Unleash Your Creativity Now: How to Freewrite" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.thebookdesigner.com/2010/04/unleash-your-creativity-now-how-to-freewrite/" target="_blank">freewriting</a> for a few minutes to loosen up.</p> <p>If you have more time &#8212; a whole day or weekend &#8212; take time off in the afternoon to go on an adventure. Take a run or a hike, or visit a museum. <b>Taking a break can inspire new ideas, not to mention renewed enthusiasm for writing.</b></p> <h3><b>Celebrate your retreat, however long it is</b></h3> <p>If two or three hours is all that you can take, great! Open a fresh page in your notebook or computer and spend a few minutes reflecting on what you accomplished.</p> <p>Did you like your retreat? Did you feel stumped? What could you do next time to make it easier for you to write: go some place quieter (or noisier), bring a pen and notebook instead of a computer, write with a buddy? Jot down a few notes on your experience and make a quick plan for your next retreat.</p> <p>Remember, you don’t need a lot of time or money to write. You just need a few hours and a plan.</p> <p><b>Have you taken yourself on a DIY writing retreat &#8212; or are you inspired to create one? </b></p> <span id="pty_trigger"></span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/want-reach-writing-goals-try-diy-writing-retreat/">Want to Reach Your Writing Goals?
