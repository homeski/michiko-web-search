However, if you´ve been freelance blogging for a while, you might find the course is overall too focused on the beginner level for you.</p> <p><b>What It Will Help You Do:</b> The course will teach you how to write for the web. You’ll learn how to structure a post, how to write compelling articles, how to optimize your writing for SEO and for a specific audience, and how to combat writer’s block and find new ideas for blogging.</p> <p>You’ll also learn how find potential clients, how to pitch your services, and what to do once they’re interested.</p> <p><b>What’s Included</b>: Two sections of the course, Paid to Blog and Successful Blogging, which touch on different aspects of the freelance blogging business.</p> <ul> <li><b>Part 1: Paid to Blog: </b>This section focuses on the “hard” skills and tools you need to succeed as a freelance blogger. Learn how to create your blog from scratch, find clients, pitch your writing, negotiate rates, create a contract, track your time and bill your clients. This section also helps you learn how to use social media to promote your blog and how to build your writing business.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><b>Part 2: Successful Blogging: </b>In this guide, Tom focuses on the “soft” skills, since landing gigs is only half the battle. As a freelance blogger, you also need to be able to write compelling posts, understand your audience, format and structure your blog posts well, and use SEO to your advantage.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><b>Bonuses: </b>If you choose the full package (which I did and heartily recommend), you also get exclusive interviews with writers like Carol Tice from<a title="Make a Living Writing" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.makealivingwriting.com/" target="_blank"> Make a Living Writing</a>, Sophie Lizard from<a title="Be a Freelance Blogger" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~beafreelanceblogger.com/" target="_blank"> Be a Freelance Blogger</a>, and Ali Luke from <a title="Aliventures" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.aliventures.com/" target="_blank">Aliventures</a>.</li> </ul> <p><b>The Best Part</b>: The best part of Tom´s course is that after finishing it, you are ready to get to work. There’s no excuse not to start, since actionable steps are laid out in every lesson.</p> <p>Along with explaining the concepts, Tom also gives you homework and examples of how he accomplished each task. He’s also available to answer questions, so you can email him anytime if you’re not sure how to do something. You can come back to the course at any time to review key concepts.</p> <p><b>What Would Make It Even Better</b>: I can’t think of anything that could be improved. The course addresses every part of the freelance blogging business, and its tips are well explained.</p> <p><b>How It Changed My Life</b>: I started blogging two years ago, not necessarily knowing what I was doing. For a year and a half, I wrote about things I was interested in. I was lucky enough to land a few freelance writing jobs, but I still wasn’t sure where I was headed.</p> <p>Finding Tom’s blog and course was key to my writing career. While going through the course, I learned all the things I was doing wrong and how to improve them.</p> <p>Paid to Blog gave me the confidence to launch my freelance blogging business. I just relaunched my blog on WordPress, and I learned how to write better blog posts for my audience. I’m also more confident in pitching clients and just landed my first paid blogging client.</p> <p><b>Our Recommendation</b>: If you’re new to the world of freelance blogging, this course will help you start your business. Its actionable steps will help you improve as a blogger and find paying clients.</p> <p><i>This post contains affiliate links.

No frustration. Minimal time investment. An amazing manuscript or blog post.</p> <p>Alas, no such magic wand exists. But we do have automatic editing tools, which are the next-best things. Just remember that <b>automatic editing tools are designed to make editing easier, not to eliminate the work completely.</b></p> <h2><b>Putting automatic editing tools to the test</b></h2> <p>During <a title="Self-Editing Basics: 10 Simple Ways to Edit Your Own Book" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/self-editing-basics/" target="_blank">self-edits</a> on my latest manuscript, I experimented with six editing tools, both free and paid, to determine which could be most beneficial to The Write Life’s audience. Besides being an author, I’m an editor, so I also weighed each tool against what I’d look for when editing.</p> <p>Since editing, which is anything that improves your writing, has a broad definition, it’s not surprising that the tools I tried had different functions, from checking grammar and style, to eliminating unnecessary words, to identifying areas for improvement.</p> <p>What you want your editing tool to do will influence which one (or ones) you choose. No one tool can do it all &#8212; nor can one of these tools wave away the work and critical thinking necessary for a well-edited book. <b>An automatic editing tool doesn’t replace a human editor.</b> Because language rules and elements of a good story can be so flexible, human eyes will always be superior to the rigidity of automatic tools.</p> <p>Here are those six tools broken into three categories, based on function.</p> <p><i>[Editor’s note: Some companies offered free access to the paid versions of their tools for the purposes of this test, but all opinions are the writer’s.]</i></p> <h2><b>Check your grammar and style</b></h2> <p>Sometimes, you just want to make sure you&#8217;re not making any silly spelling or grammar mistakes.</p> <h3><b>1. </b><b><a title="Grammarly" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7319408-11578192" target="_blank">Grammarly</a></b></h3> <p><b>What It Does: </b>Grammarly is a grammar checker and proofreader.</p> <p><b>Price:</b> $29.95 per month, $59.95 per quarter or $139.95 per year</p> <p><b>Who It’s For:</b> Anyone, though most useful for corporate business people and academics.</p> <p><b>How It Works:</b> Copy and paste the text into the online dashboard and let Grammarly work its magic. It flags potential errors, gives suggestions and provides an explanation if you need it.</p> <p><b>The Best Part:</b> Grammarly is easy to use and pointed out a vocabulary issue or two that none of the other tools did. It’s superior to Microsoft Word’s grammar checker.</p> <p><b>What Would Make It Better:</b> As an editor, I’ve found that many people don’t understand or care to learn the technical explanation for why something’s wrong. Plain language (or as plain as you can get) explanations for mistakes would make it accessible to more writers.</p> <p><b>Our Recommendation:</b> Grammarly is best for the final <a title="Self-Publishing? These Editing Tips Will Ensure You Release a Quality Book" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/self-publishing-editing-tips/" target="_blank">proofreading</a> stage, or for people who want to learn more about the technical aspects grammar. If you’re an editor or strong writer, you might find yourself ignoring more flagged items than you fix.</p> <h3><b>2. </b><b><a title="After the Deadline" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.afterthedeadline.com/" target="_blank">After the Deadline</a></b></h3> <p><b>What It Does: </b>Like Grammarly, After the Deadline is a grammar checker.</p> <p><b>Price:</b> Free for personal use</p> <p><b>Who It’s For:</b> Anyone</p> <p><b>How It Works:</b> Click “Demonstration,” paste the text you want to check, and click “Check Writing.” After the Deadline underlines any potential issues and explains its reasoning.</p> <p><b>The Best Part:</b> It’s free! You can also use it on your self-hosted WordPress site, as an extension or add-on for Chrome or Firefox, or with OpenOffice.org.</p> <p><b>What Would Make It Better:</b> A definition of passive voice that explains how you construct it grammatically. After the Deadline rightly explains what passive voice does, but it seems to focus only on the “be” verb, which occasionally leads to falsely labeling non-passive constructions as passive.</p> <p><b>Our Recommendation:</b> You get what you pay for with After the Deadline. Use it for a final proofread, but exercise good judgment and don’t make every change it suggests &#8212; it’s not as sophisticated as Grammarly.</p> <h2><b>Improve your writing</b></h2> <p>If you&#8217;re looking for a critique that goes a bit deeper, try one of these options.</p> <h3><b>3. </b><b><a title="AutoCrit" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://oa127.infusionsoft.com/go/autocrit/thewritelife" target="_blank">AutoCrit</a></b></h3> <p><b>What It Does: </b>AutoCrit analyzes your manuscript to identify areas for improvement, including pacing and momentum, dialogue, strong writing, word choice and repetition.</p> <p><b>Price:</b> $5 per month, $8 per month or $12 per month. Your membership level determines how many words you can analyze at once, from 1,000 words to unlimited.</p> <p><b>Who It’s For</b>: Fiction writers</p> <p><b>How It Works: </b>Paste your text into the online dashboard or upload a document and click on AutoCrit’s tabs to see their analysis.</p> <p><b>The Best Part:</b> I spent the most time in “Compare to Fiction” tab, which is a comprehensive look at common issues. It highlighted my tendency to start sentences with “and” and “but,” and identified my most repeated words. I felt like I learned something about my writing, and that’s something I don’t think I could say about the other tools.</p> <p><b>What Would Make It Better:</b> A more accurate definition of passive voice. It highlights any use of the “be” and “had” verbs, neither of which fully capture <a title="Passive Voice" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/passive-voice" target="_blank">passive voice</a> (you need a past participle in addition to a “be” verb), and many active voice constructions were falsely labeled as passive.</p> <p><b>Our Recommendation:</b> AutoCrit is great to guide your edits in the <a title="Use Hemingway’s Advice to Rewrite Like a Pro" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/use-hemingways-advice-to-rewrite-like-a-pro/" target="_blank">self-editing</a> stage. It’s best used for developmental edits, rewrites and avoiding common writing no-nos.</p> <h3><b>4. </b><b><a title="ProWritingAid" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~prowritingaid.com?afid=1714" target="_blank">ProWritingAid</a></b></h3> <p><b>What It Does: </b>ProWritingAid analyzes your writing and produces reports on areas such as overused words, writing style, sentence length, grammar and repeat words and phrases.</p> <p><b>Price:</b> Free, with a premium membership that gives you access to more options such as using ProWritingAid in Microsoft Word and Google Docs, the ability to edit text within the text editor, and access to more reports.</p> <p><b>Who It’s For:</b> Anyone</p> <p><b>How It Works:</b> Click on “Editing Tool,” paste your text, then click “Analyze.” Only members can paste over 1,000 words at a time, but membership is free with an email address or social media account. Use the sidebar on the left to view potential edits to make.</p> <p><b>The Best Part:</b> ProWritingAid delivers similar results to AutoCrit, and though ProWritingAid has a premium option, most of the areas you’ll want checked are available for free.</p> <p><b>What Would Make It Better:</b> Though ProWritingAid checks grammar, I slipped in a your/you’re mistake without getting flagged. I wasn’t overly fond of the website design, especially with its big ads, but it’s functional and ads are the price you pay for a free tool.</p> <p><b>Our Recommendation:</b> Use ProWritingAid in the self-editing stage to guide your edits. It may not be as comprehensive as AutoCrit, but for a free tool, it’s a decent contender.</p> <h3><b>5. </b><b><a title="Hemingway App" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.hemingwayapp.com/" target="_blank">Hemingway App</a></b></h3> <p><b>What It Does:</b> Hemingway App provides a readability score &#8212; the lowest grade level someone would need to understand the text &#8212; and analyzes your writing to identify areas for improvement.</p> <p><b>Price:</b> Free online, $6.99 for desktop version</p> <p><b>Who It’s For:</b> Anyone</p> <p><b>How It Works:</b> Paste your text into the dashboard and scan for highlighted sections of text. The highlighted text is color coded depending on your area of improvement: hard to read sentences, presence of adverbs, simpler phrases or passive voice use.</p> <p><b>The Best Part:</b> In addition to providing examples on how to fix passive voice or complex phrases, Hemingway App also identifies how many -ly adverbs and passive voice constructions you have and suggests a maximum number to use based on your word count.</p> <p>In my prologue, for example, I had one use of passive voice, and Hemingway App suggested aiming for six uses or fewer &#8212; which I nailed. These recommendations reinforce the idea that not all adverbs or passive voice constructions are bad, and that’s something other tools miss.</p> <p><b>What Would Make It Better:</b> Hemingway App was the cleanest and easiest to use of the free editing tools, but it’s not a grammar checker or proofreader. Even though it’s not meant to catch grammar and spelling mistakes, any editing application that catches those mistakes is instantly more attractive.</p> <p><b>Our Recommendation:</b> Use Hemingway App to increase the readability of your writing and identify problem sentences during the <a title="25 Editing Tips for Tightening Your Copy: Now a Printable Checklist" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/25-editing-tips-checklist-form/" target="_blank">copyediting</a> stage, but supplement your efforts with a grammar and spell checker.</p> <h2><b>Eliminate word fluff</b></h2> <p>Those unnecessary words and phrases are getting in your story&#8217;s way.</p> <h3><b>6. </b><b><a title="WordRake" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.wordrake.com/" target="_blank">WordRake</a></b></h3> <p><b>What It Does: </b>WordRake cuts out the unnecessary words or phrases that creep into your writing. It works with Microsoft Word and Outlook, depending on which license you purchase. I tested the Microsoft Word version.</p> <p><b>Price:</b> $129 for one year, $229 for two or $259 for three years (Microsoft Word-only version)</p> <p><b>Who It’s For:</b> Bloggers, authors and editors using Microsoft Word</p> <p><b>How It Works:</b> WordRake is an add-in for Microsoft Word and requires you to install the program before using it, though it’s as easy as following the instructions. In Word, select the text you want to edit, then use the WordRake add-in. It uses track changes to suggest edits, which you can accept or reject.</p> <p><b>The Best Part:</b> WordRake is as close as you can get to an automatic editor. It appealed to me more as an editor than writer, but it’s great at eliminating unnecessary phrases and words &#8212; and it’s those words that bog down your writing.</p> <p><b>What Would Make It Better:</b> I threw a your/you’re mistake in to see if WordRake would catch it. It didn’t, even though Microsoft Word flagged it. If WordRake could catch common writing mistakes like your/you’re, their/they’re/there in addition to unnecessary words, it’d be a hard tool to beat.</p> <p><b>Our Recommendation: </b>WordRake is a great tool for the copyediting stage.

You want to call your own shots, set your own hours and work from your own space.</p> <p>You have weighed the pros and cons, <a title="4 Steps to Prepare for the Instability of the Freelance Life" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/prepare-for-the-instability-of-freelance-life/" target="_blank">made a plan</a> and are ready to turn your side hustle into your full-time job. You have a couple of regular clients on board, with a few more waiting in the wings. You’ve cleaned out that weird little nook in the corner of your house and put in a nice desk and some office trappings so you don’t have to write with your laptop on your knees.</p> <p>You’ve given notice to your employer, EasyPub, updated your website and given yourself a pump-up talk. You’re ready to dive into life as a <a title="How to Handle Being a Full-Time Freelancer (Without Going Nuts)" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/how-to-handle-being-a-full-time-freelancer-without-going-nuts/" target="_blank">full-time freelancer</a>!</p> <p>Before you do, make sure you’ve planned ahead to get your legal ducks in a row &#8212; you don’t want the contract you signed with your employer to come back to bite you.</p> <p><b>If you know your obligations, you’ll be able to prepare to launch your freelance business while staying on the right side of the law.</b> Here are the things you need to consider before you leave your day job.</p> <h2><b>1. Your contractual obligations to your existing employer</b></h2> <p>If you signed a contract at any time while you were working for the company, you need to check to see if you agreed to these specific provisions. Some companies put these provisions in their employees handbooks, so you’ll need to look at that, too.</p> <h3>Non-compete clause</h3> <p>A non-compete agreement prevents you from working in competition with your employer and must be limited in time (generally not more than two years) and geographic scope. Non-competes are enforceable in <a title="Employee Noncompetes A State by State Survey" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.beckreedriden.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Noncompetes-50-State-Survey-Chart-20130814.pdf" target="_blank">most, but not all states</a>.</p> <p><strong>If you have signed a non-compete, you must read it carefully to determine what you can and cannot do to make a living after you leave the company.</strong> For example, a non-compete might say that if you’re a copywriter for a marketing company in Chicago, you can’t work for any competitive company within a 25-mile radius for two years.</p> <h3>Non-solicitation of customers agreement</h3> <p>A <a title="Understanding Nonsolicitation Agreements" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/understanding-nonsolicitation-agreements.html" target="_blank">non-solicitation of customers agreement</a> is designed to prevent former employees from poaching the company’s customers for a limited period of time, usually a year. This is different from a non-compete and is becoming more common.</p> <p>If your job involved close interaction with customers, they have a relationship with you. The company doesn’t want to lose the customers when they lose you as an employee.</p> <p>As with the non-compete provision, non-solicitation provisions are enforceable in most states, but not all. You will not be able to work with the company’s customers after you leave your job if you signed an agreement with a non-solicitation provision in it. This provision could impact your projected income, if you were planning on continuing to write copy for Acme Corp. as a freelancer.</p> <h3><b>Non-solicitation of employees clause</b></h3> <p>If you’re leaving your job to start your own company and are planning to hire your own employees, you need to be aware of this provision. Many companies want to protect their workers from being taken by departing employees for a certain period of time, usually a year.</p> <p>Again, the company is trying to protect its relationships with contract language and the contract, if reasonable, is enforceable in most states.</p> <h2><b>2. Your fiduciary obligations to your existing employer</b></h2> <p>A fiduciary obligation is the duty to act in another person’s best interest and not in your own. It means you have to put that other person first &#8212; and in this case it’s your employer. When you’re making plans to leave your job, keep these two points in mind.</p> <h3><b>Best efforts</b></h3> <p>While you are still with EasyPub, you have the obligation to use your best efforts at your job &#8212; even while you’re planning to leave it. Don’t get distracted by the excitement of going out on your own and forget to give your all to your current employer before you leave.</p> <h3><b>Duty of loyalty</b></h3> <p>If you’re a high-level or skilled employee with the company, you owe a duty of loyalty while still employed. <b>When you’re planning to leave your job, you may not take any action that competes with the company</b> (like convincing a prospective customer to hold an assignment until you’re on your own), <b>even if you haven’t signed a non-compete agreement.</b></p> <p>You always want to leave a job on good terms. Building and keeping good relationships with former employers will be useful as you develop your career and perhaps build your own company.</p> <div class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Leaving+your+job%3F+Don%27t+take+any+action+that+competes+with+the+company%2C+says+%40KathrynGoldman&via=thewritelife&related=thewritelife&url=http://thewritelife.com/quit-job-to-freelance-legal/&naytev_force=true' target='_blank'>Leaving your job?

Ownership of intellectual property and confidential information</b></h2> <p>While working for EasyPub, you had access to the company’s information. Some of the information had to do with customers, some of it related to EasyPub’s business and some of it you created yourself.</p> <p>You have obligations to protect EasyPub’s confidential information and to respect its intellectual property even after you leave the company.</p> <h3><b>Intellectual property</b></h3> <p>Work you created while you were employed by EasyPub belongs to the company unless you have a written agreement that says otherwise.</p> <p>When you are <a title="How Your Miserable Day Job Can Help Launch Your Freelance Career" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/launch-your-freelance-career/" target="_blank">making your plans</a> to leave EasyPub, you should not create any work on the company’s time, or using the company’s equipment, materials or other resources.</p> <p>To be sure that what you create during this planning stage is yours and not the company’s, you should not use your company-issued laptop or other tools for your side hustle. Don’t use your company email address to do business for your new gig. Keep everything completely separate to protect yourself and your new business.</p> <h3><b>Confidential information</b></h3> <p>Most companies have provisions in their handbooks that require employees to return all company property, including all information in the employee’s possession, to prevent any disclosure of that information.</p> <p>To comply, search your computer, email (including sent and deleted email), any cloud storage services, phone, iPad, and anywhere and everywhere else you might have stored files or data owned by the company.</p> <p>Leaving a day job to go out on your own is an exciting time. Reduce the risk and calm your nerves by being thoughtful about how you do it.</p> <p><i>Kathryn is a lawyer, but she’s not </i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>your</i></span><i> lawyer, so this article isn’t technically legal advice.

Leave a comment by December 15, 2014, to enter!</i></p> <p>If you’re like me, you spent most of your childhood in school. That’s where you learned how to learn, and you’ve probably come to associate improvement with school. So, when it comes to improving your writing, it’s natural that you would consider a Master of Arts (MA) or a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree. After all, what better better way to give yourself time to write and a structured place to do it?</p> <p>But MFAs are time consuming and expensive, and it’s certainly possible to significantly improve as a writer without them. <b>How do you know if an MFA is right for you?</b> And can you reproduce the benefits of an MFA without enrolling in a program?</p> <h2><b>My take on the MFA debate</b></h2> <p>Full disclosure: I have both a BA and an MA in writing. It’s hard for me to regret those years; they were a lot of fun and I gained an enormous amount of experience. I also met my husband, so I can’t say my MA was useless. However, I think I could have taken another path, perhaps one that didn’t require so much of my time, money and inner calm.</p> <p>Based on my experience, I don’t think having an MA or MFA is necessary to become a great writer. This should be obvious to anyone who knows anything about literary history: Many famous and influential writers did not begin in academia.</p> <p><b>Instead, to become a better writer without a set path, replicate important aspects of the MFA.</b> Basically, the money you spend for your MFA (and it’s a lot of money) insists upon discipline and buys a few elements crucial to the writing process. Recreate these elements on your own to strengthen your writing skills without enrolling in an MFA.</p> <h2><b>1. Read across genres</b></h2> <p>Great writers need to read; there’s no way around this one. Language has to start in your brain to end up on the page, and the best way to get it there is to read. (Or listen to audiobooks on tape, whatever works for you).</p> <p>Expose yourself to past developments in your genre, as well as what’s happening now. This is where you acquire the tools you’ll use, as well as improve on, later.</p> <p>While reading may seem like a simple task, it’s not. With hundreds of millions of <a title="Google: There Are 129,864,880 Books in the Entire World" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~mashable.com/2010/08/05/number-of-books-in-the-world/" target="_blank">books in the world</a>, it can be impossible to know where to start. <b>An MFA program will not only give you an organized, vetted list of these books, but it will also force you to read them and analyze them thoughtfully.</b> The program will expose you to new styles and authors you may never have come across otherwise, expanding your toolset and allowing you to contextualize your own work.</p> <p>You can discover new works and authors without an MFA, of course, and you should continue to do it after one. <b>Read everything &#8212; not only in your genre, but in completely new ones.</b> Step outside your comfort zone. Read extensively and often. Listen to books on your way to work, and always have something new to read.</p> <div class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Read+everything+--+not+only+in+your+genre%2C+but+in+completely+new+ones%2C+says+%40inkhat&via=thewritelife&related=thewritelife&url=http://thewritelife.com/do-you-need-an-mfa/&naytev_force=true' target='_blank'>Read everything -- not only in your genre, but in completely new ones, says @inkhat</a></span><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Read+everything+--+not+only+in+your+genre%2C+but+in+completely+new+ones%2C+says+%40inkhat&via=thewritelife&related=thewritelife&url=http://thewritelife.com/do-you-need-an-mfa/&naytev_force=true' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'>Click To Tweet</a></div> <p>Don’t know where to start? Published authors often give examples of their favorite works in interviews. Look up one or two of your favorite writers, and try a few of their recommendations.</p> <h2><b>2. Meet word count requirements</b></h2> <p>Writing is craft, and craft requires time and effort. Carving out this time can be difficult. Unless you’re the incarnation of discipline, you’re going to have trouble hitting your <a title="Write Every Day: How to Meet Your Daily Writing Goals" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/daily-writing-goals/" target="_blank">word count goal</a> every day.</p> <p>An MFA program will insist on that word count. It requires you to produce, and to produce at a fast pace, something that is necessary to learn your craft.</p> <p>This pace also helps you develop the ability to stop thinking of every sentence as precious, let go of your inner editor and move on &#8212; which can be harder than it seems. The less you’ve written, the more valuable each word becomes, and the more difficult it is to edit them. As you keep writing, you’ll realize that your ideas, no matter how poetic, aren’t perfect. Editing and writing become easier the more you do the work of hitting that word count goal.</p> <p>Of course, you can achieve daily writing goals without an MFA, but the process involves a great deal of discipline and focus. You have to push yourself to meet daily, weekly or monthly word counts. It’s hard to do this alone, which is where the final element comes into play.</p> <h2><b>3. Find a group of supportive, committed people</b></h2> <p>You need to foster a group of peers with whom you can discuss and trade writing. These should be people whose writing and opinions you respect, and who aren’t afraid to offer constructive criticism. If you find yourself in a group that only praises your writing, leave. It’s not going to help you at all.</p> <p>An MFA will give you this group gift-wrapped and ready to go. You start with a <a title="9 Keys to Creating an Effective Writing Accountability Group" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/writing-accountability-group/" target="_blank">critique group</a> on day one, writers vetted and approved by the same people who selected you. It’s likely that these relationships, both as friends and colleagues, will continue long after you’ve left the program.</p> <p>Again, a writing critique group is something you can create on your own, but it can be challenging. Writing is a solitary art, and many writers tend to be independent by nature. <a title="Want to Join a Writing Group? 8 Places to Look" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/join-writing-group/" target="_blank">Finding a group</a> means fostering professional relationships, and that can take time and effort.</p> <p>Look online for local groups, or attend local <a title="29 Fantastic Writing Conferences for Authors, Bloggers and Freelancers" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/28-fantastic-writers-conferences-authors-bloggers-freelancers/" target="_blank">conventions and conferences</a> in your genre. Go to signings and readings. Chances are you’ll find intelligent, like-minded people who can help you learn to write, and vice versa.</p> <h2><b>Do you need an MFA?</b></h2> <p>If you’re having trouble with these elements, or the discipline of writing itself, an MFA might be the right choice for you.</p> <p>Enrolling in a program also buys you dedicated time to write, which is often difficult to find when you’re working a <a title="How to Stay Sane While Building Your Writing Career Part Time" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/stay-sane-building-writing-career-part-time/" target="_blank">full-time job</a>. It’s also a socially acceptable time to write, which translates fairly seamlessly into a resume when you leave. It may not land you a job, but it’s an easy story to explain. A program also exposes you to research tools and professional pathways you might not otherwise be able to access.</p> <p>On the other hand, pursuing an MFA is a serious undertaking that requires a great deal of time and money.

Those feelings aren’t reserved for the movies.</p> <p>But how much study have you put into <i>how</i> your favorite horror authors have gone about scaring you with the written word?</p> <p>Movies rely on editing, music cues, performance, special visual and makeup effects . . . a whole parade of <a title="Writing a Novel? 6 Visual Storytelling Techniques to Borrow From Film and TV" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/writing-novel-6-visual-storytelling-techniques-borrow-film-tv/" target="_blank">cinematic tools</a>. But in prose all we have to work with are words, and our readers’ imaginations. The good news is that those are powerful tools.</p> <p>Though you may not have much control over any individual reader’s imagination, or his interpretation of your work, the ways you arrange words into sentences and sentences into paragraphs can activate your readers’ psyches in ways you may not have thought possible.</p> <h2><b>It all comes down to breathing</b></h2> <p>Even when reading silently, we tend to breathe along with what we’re reading as if we were reading it aloud. It’s impossible for us to turn certain parts of our brain off and when something causes us to start <a title="FREAKY: Your Breathing Patterns Change When You Read Email" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.businessinsider.com/email-apnea-how-email-change-breathing-2012-12" target="_blank">breathing differently</a>, that forces us into different states. When you’re in a blind panic you tend to hyperventilate, breathing in quick, shallow gasps. When you’re nervous or anxious about something (the feeling of suspense), you tend to hold your breath, and breathe more slowly.</p> <p>The good news for horror and thriller authors is that these processes also work <i>in reverse</i>. <b>If you can force that breathing state</b> (or, more accurately, some smaller, less physically traumatic version of that state) <b>in your readers, you’ll bring on the requisite psychological response.</b></p> <h2><b>Evoking suspense and anxiety</b></h2> <p>When you’re building suspense, evoking a feeling of impending doom or the terrifying fear of the unknown, get your reader to hold her breath. Stop her from taking her next breath for longer than normal. And though it may seem impossible to do this with words on a page, remember what I said about how we unconsciously breathe as though we’re reading aloud even when we aren’t.</p> <p>One of the reasons that sentences are finite is that the period at the end allows us a breath. Paragraphs give us a chance to take a deeper breath. So if you want your reader to slow her breathing and start feeling nervous, anxious or fearful, keep your sentences long, and your paragraphs even longer.</p> <p>Very near the beginning of Shirley Jackson’s classic <a title="The Haunting of Hill House" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143039989/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0143039989&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=ABIDEC3TV3SFGLPV" target="_blank"><i>The Haunting of Hill House</i></a>, the protagonist, Eleanor, is on her way to meet her fellow paranormal investigators at a house that’s known to be haunted. Though excited about being a part of something potentially important, and getting away from her dreary life in the city, Eleanor is terrified of what she’ll find there, not just from ghosts but as a result of what we’d now refer to as social anxiety. The closer she gets to the house, the more anxious she is.</p> <p>Jackson conveys this anxiety with a single paragraph wherein Eleanor makes a stop in a small town along the way and has a cup of coffee. It’s an innocuous scene, but told in a tight <a title="Point of View: How Writers Can Master This Crucial Story Element" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/point-of-view/" target="_blank">POV</a>, it’s incredibly nerve-wracking. This single paragraph consists of ten sentences. The first of those sentences is the shortest at 28 words. The last is the longest at 52 words.</p> <p>Think about the last time you read, much less wrote, a sentence that’s 52 words long.</p> <p><b>By the end of that monster paragraph, Shirley Jackson left her readers gasping for air</b>, and helped solidify <i>The Haunting of Hill House </i>as one of the undisputed classics of the genre.</p> <h2><b>Eliciting horror and panic</b></h2> <p>On the flip side, eventually the monster, serial killer or villain finally reveals himself and the terror (a generalized, creepy dread) turns to horror (the visceral reaction to a traumatic event in progress).</p> <p>Now you want to do just the opposite: <b>Force your readers to breathe </b><b><i>too often</i></b><b>.</b> Get them hyperventilating. Do this with short sentences. Even shorter paragraphs.</p> <p>One-sentence paragraphs.</p> <p>In another classic haunted house tale, <a title="Hell House" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312868855/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0312868855&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=P2KIFBWUFOBAS4KH" target="_blank"><i>Hell House</i></a>, author Richard Matheson evokes this feeling of panic in one scene of nine paragraphs, each with no more than two short sentences. Readers have been trained to take a full breath after each paragraph, so breaths are coming fast and furious through:</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>She stopped with a gasp and looked at the Spanish table.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>The telephone was ringing.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>It can’t, she thought. It hasn’t worked in more than thirty years.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>She wouldn’t answer it. She knew who it was.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>It kept on ringing, the shrill sounds stabbing at her eardrums, at her brain.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>She mustn’t answer it. She wouldn’t.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>The telephone kept ringing.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>“No,” she said.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>Ringing. Ringing. Ringing. Ringing.</i></p> <p>I know &#8212; technically, that last paragraph has four sentences, but let’s consider that staccato stacking of “Ringing”s as one sentence with partial breaths between each word.</p> <p>Instead of a single ten-sentence-long paragraph, we have paragraphs of one or two sentences, with the longest sentence/paragraph clocking in at 14 words, or precisely half the length of Shirley Jackson’s <i>shortest</i> sentence.</p> <p>Following this scene, there are a couple of slightly longer paragraphs as the protagonist tries to take charge of the situation, but this is quickly dismissed by more staccato attacks on the senses. And, like <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i>, the ongoing success of <i>Hell House</i> is proof of its effectiveness.</p> <h2><b>Putting this technique into practice</b></h2> <p>This idea of controlling your readers’ breathing is not the be-all-end-all of “<a title="Writing Scary: How to Use Pacing, Sentence Structure, and Word Choice to Scare the Pants Off Your Readers" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~tutorials.writersdigest.com/p-507-writing-scary-how-to-use-pacing-sentence-structure-and-word-choice-to-scare-the-pants-off-your-readers.aspx" target="_blank">writing scary</a>,” but with some practice it will work for you.</p> <p>And being aware of when to best use this strategy will also prevent you from overusing it, and move the majority of your prose somewhere into the readable, accessible, and comfortable center &#8212; until you want things to start getting scary again.</p> <p><strong><b>Do you “write scary”?

How are you supposed to erase or replace the precious words and sentences you’ve slaved over?</p> <p>Though it’s only been a few months since I’ve gone <a title="How to Handle Being a Full-Time Freelancer (Without Going Nuts)" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/how-to-handle-being-a-full-time-freelancer-without-going-nuts/" target="_blank">full-time freelance</a> as an editor and writer, I’ve already witnessed dozens of simple mistakes all writers (including this one) can fix on their own.</p> <p>While self-editing is often creativity-destroying when writing your first draft, wise writers would do well to work through the following suggestions before sending their manuscript to a professional editor or to their <a title="Writing Feedback: The Ultimate Guide to Working with Beta Readers" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/ultimate-guide-to-beta-readers/" target="_blank">beta readers</a>.</p> <p>In addition to making you more aware of your grammatical blind spots, <b>self-editing may save you money if your editor works on a per-hour basis</b>. And though editors love to display their knowledge, they also like reading grammatically correct manuscripts.</p> <p>When you show that you’re a capable and confident writer who makes few mistakes, you may just endear yourself to an editor, and having one already lined up means one less task on your publishing to-do list the next time around. Furthermore, your beta readers and advanced review copy (ARC) reviewers will be grateful for the care you took in creating a readable early draft.</p> <p>Ready to give your book a solid self-edit? Here’s what to do.</p> <h2><b>1. Rest your manuscript</b></h2> <p>When you’ve finished typing the last word of your masterpiece, set it aside for a few days. If you can stand it, set it aside for a week or more.</p> <p>Why? You want to try to <b>forget everything you’ve written so that when you do come back to self-edit, the book almost seems as if someone else wrote it.</b> You want fresh eyes, and the best way to do that is to rid your mind of what’s been filling it for so long.</p> <h2><b>2. Print your manuscript or read it out loud</b></h2> <p>For some writers, seeing words on paper helps them catch errors they otherwise wouldn’t have seen. For others, hearing the text spoken aloud makes mistakes obvious.</p> <p>You can enlist a (very patient) friend to read it to you, or you can go the friendship-saving route and use one of a number of apps to have your book read to you in a semi-robotic voice.</p> <p>I’ve heard<a title="Voice Dream Reader" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.voicedream.com/" target="_blank"> Voice Dream Reader</a> touted as a great option for iOS users. iOS users can also turn on<a title="VoiceOver" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https//www.apple.com/accessibility/ios/voiceover/" target="_blank"> VoiceOver</a> (go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; VoiceOver), though this affects all actions on the device (like email and web browsing) until you disable it. Amazon offers a feature for Kindle devices called<a title="Read Aloud with Voice Over" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201244940" target="_blank"> Read Aloud with Voice Over</a>. For other alternatives, search for “text to speech” or “read to me” on any of the app stores or check out the options in this post.</p> <h2><b>3. Search for troubling words</b></h2> <p>All writers have specific words and phrases that (which?) always cause them to (too?) second-guess whether (weather?) they’re (their?) using them correctly. If you know what your (you’re?) troubling words are, use your word processor’s search function to locate every possible variant of that word or phrase.</p> <p>To help you consider what your troubling words might be, here’s a good starting list, excerpted from the first chapter of <a title="Grammar Girl's Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805088318/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0805088318&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=O3ZOHEL7MZH33D7W" target="_blank"><i>Grammar Girl’s Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing</i></a>:</p> <ul> <li>a lot/alot</li> <li>affect/effect</li> <li>can/may</li> <li>further/farther</li> <li>good/well</li> <li>i.e./e.g.</li> <li>into/in to</li> <li>it’s/its</li> <li>lay/lie</li> <li>less/fewer</li> <li>that/who</li> <li>their/they’re/there</li> <li>then/than</li> <li>who/whom</li> <li>your/you’re</li> </ul> <p>If you’re unsure of how to properly use these words, there’s no shame in looking them up.<a title="Grammar Girl" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~grammargirl.com" target="_blank"> Grammar Girl</a> likely has the answer, or check The Write Life’s post on <a title="25 Editing Tips for Tightening Your Copy" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/edit-your-copy/" target="_blank">25 Editing Tips for Tightening Your Copy</a> for invaluable tips.</p> <h2><b>4. Remove or replace your crutch words</b></h2> <p>Do you know the Top 10 words you use most frequently in your manuscript? Outside of necessary articles and prepositions, <b>you may be surprised at what words you tend to use over and over.</b> One client of mine used “suddenly” too often, making every action seem unnecessarily rushed. Personally, my crutch words tend to fly in the face of the age-old encouragement for all writers to “eschew obfuscation.” In other words, I tend to cash in ten-dollar words when five-cent words suffice.</p> <p>Scrivener makes it simple to discover your crutch words, and is available for both <a title="Scrivener for Mac" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~store.esellerate.net/a.asp?c=1_SKU81634174866_AFL9074343438&amp;at=post" target="_blank">Mac</a> and <a title="Scrivener for Windows" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~store.esellerate.net/a.asp?c=1_SKU82916413320_AFL9074343438&amp;at=post" target="_blank">Windows</a> users. In Scrivener’s top menu, go to “Project &gt; Text Statistics,” then click on the arrow next to “Word frequency.” If necessary, click the “Frequency” header twice to sort your words by frequency. You’ll then be presented with what could be a jarring list of the words you might be overusing. (To include your entire manuscript in the frequency count, be sure to have your entire manuscript selected in Scrivener’s Binder.)</p> <p>For Microsoft Word users, there’s a free<a title="Word Usage and Frequency add-in" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/word_usage_and_frequency_report.html" target="_blank"> Word Usage and Frequency add-in</a>, but other, less technical online solutions may also help, like<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~textfixer.com"> TextFixer.com</a><a title="TextFixer.com’s Online Word Counter" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.textfixer.com/tools/online-word-counter.php" target="_blank">’s Online Word Counter</a> or<a title="WriteWords’ Word Frequency Counter" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.writewords.org.uk/word_count.asp" target="_blank"> WriteWords’ Word Frequency Counter</a>.</p> <p>No matter how you determine your crutch words, go back through your manuscript and see where you can remove or replace them.</p> <h2><b>5. Remove all double spaces at the end of sentences</b></h2> <p>If tapping two spaces following your sentences is an age-old habit ingrained into you since before the dawn of modern digital typography, may I suggest ingraining another practice?</p> <p><b>Conduct a find-and-replace search after you’re done writing.</b> In Word, type two spaces in “find” and one space in “replace” and hit enter. Voila! You just time-traveled your manuscript into the 21st Century. (If you’re interested in why you should only use one space, read Slate’s <a title="Space Invaders: Why you should never, ever use two spaces after a period" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/01/space_invaders.html" target="_blank">Space Invaders: Why you should never, ever use two spaces after a period</a>.)</p> <h2><b>6. Search for problematic punctuation</b></h2> <p>Are you a comma chameleon, adapting that otherwise innocent punctuation mark to do work it was never meant to do? Or does your manuscript need a semicolonoscopy &#8212; a thorough checkup on proper semicolon and colon placement?</p> <p>If you know you have trouble with certain punctuation marks, conduct a search for that mark and figure out whether you’re using it correctly. If you’re still unsure, let your editor fix it, but make a note to ask him why.</p> <h2><b>7. Run spell check</b></h2> <p>I think writers become too accustomed to the colorful squiggles under words and sentences on their digital pages; I know I do. In an effort to get ideas on the page, we might run rampant over grammar and usage.</p> <p>Yet those squiggles mean something. At the very, <i>very</i> least, run spell check before sending your manuscript to an editor or beta reader. It’s a built-in editor that I’m not sure every writer uses to their advantage. You may not accept every recommendation, but at least you’ll save your editor some time correcting basic errors.</p> <h2><b>8. Subscribe to </b><b><i>The Chicago Manual of Style</i></b></h2> <p>When an editor returns your manuscript, they may cite particular sections of <em><a title="The Chicago Manual of Style" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html" target="_blank">The Chicago Manual of Style</a></em>. If you’re unfamiliar with this Bible of the publishing industry, you may not be aware of precisely why the editor made a certain change.</p> <p>By subscribing to CMOS (it’s only $35 a year), you’ll be able to look up issues on your own <i>before</i> sending your manuscript off to an editor or beta reader. Sure, you shouldn’t get too hung up on some of the issues (editors have their jobs for a reason), but learning more about the mechanics of writing can only help you become a better writer.</p> <p>You can also buy the hardcopy version of <a title="The Chicago Manual of Style" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226104206/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0226104206&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=V3Y5PWQ7XJO6EBQV" target="_blank"><i>The Chicago Manual of Style</i></a>, but I recommend the online version for its ease of use.</p> <h2><b>9. Format accordingly</b></h2> <p>While preferred styles may differ from one editor to the next, you can <b>show your professionalism by formatting your manuscript to conform to industry standards.</b></p> <p>Such formatting makes it easier for beta readers to consume, and editors prefer industry-standard formatting, which allows them more time to edit your actual words instead of tweaking your formatting. Here are some basic formatting tips:</p> <ul> <li>Send your manuscript as a Word document (.doc or .docx).</li> <li>Use double-spaced line spacing. If you’ve already written your book with different line spacing, select all of your text in Word, click Format &gt; Paragraph, then select “Double” in the drop down box under “Line spacing.”</li> <li>Use a single space following periods.</li> <li>Use black, 12-point, Times New Roman as the font.</li> <li>Don’t hit tab to indent paragraphs. In Word, select all of your text, then set indentation using Format &gt; Paragraph. Under “Indentation” and by “Left,” type .5. Under “Special,” choose “First line” from the drop down menu.</li> <li>The first paragraph of any chapter, after a subheader, or following a bulleted or numbered list <i>shouldn’t</i> be indented.</li> <li>Use page breaks between chapters. In Word, place the cursor at the end of a chapter, then click “Insert &gt; Break &gt; Page Break” in Word’s menu.</li> </ul> <h2><b>10. Don’t over-edit</b></h2> <p>Set aside an hour or two to go through this list with your manuscript, but be careful about over-editing. You may start seeing unnecessary trees within your forest of words, but you don’t want to raze to the ground what you’ve toiled so hard to grow.</p> <p>There’s a middle path between exhausting yourself in a vain attempt for perfection and being too lazy to run spell check. <b>Do yourself and your book a favor and self-edit, but be careful to not go overboard.</b></p> <p>If you’re creating a professional product, your self-edits shouldn’t be your last line of defense against grammatical errors. In other words, I don’t offer this post to write myself out of a job. Even in going through the self-editing steps above, you’ll still need an editor to ensure that your manuscript is as polished as possible. You will still miss errors. Plus, going through the editing process with a professional editor will help you become a better self-editor the next time you write a book.</p> <p><strong><b>Do you self-edit? Why or why not? What else do you look for when going through your manuscript before sharing it with others?</b></strong></p> <p><em>Photo by <a class="owner-name truncate" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://www.flickr.com/photos/rowdykittens/8333813651" target="_blank" data-track="attributionNameClick" data-rapid_p="33">Tammy Strobel</a> under Creative Commons</em></p> <span id="pty_trigger"></span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/self-editing-basics/">Self-Editing Basics: 10 Simple Ways to Edit Your Own Book</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com">The Write Life</a>.</p> <Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" alt="" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0" hspace="0" src="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/80114941/0/thewritelife">]]><![CDATA[<div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a title="Like on Facebook" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/80114941/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Share on Google+" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/80114941/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Pin it!" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/80114941/thewritelife,"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Tweet This" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/80114941/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Subscribe by RSS" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/80114941/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;</div>]]></content:encoded> 			<wfw:commentRss>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/80114941/0/thewritelife~SelfEditing-Basics-Simple-Ways-to-Edit-Your-Own-Book/feed/</wfw:commentRss> 		<slash:comments>18</slash:comments></item><item><feedburner:origLink>http://thewritelife.com/23-gifts-for-writers/</feedburner:origLink> 		<title>23 Gifts for Writers: Fun Ideas for Christmas and Chanukah</title> 		<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/80036664/0/thewritelife~Gifts-for-Writers-Fun-Ideas-for-Christmas-and-Chanukah/</link> 		<comments>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/80036664/0/thewritelife~Gifts-for-Writers-Fun-Ideas-for-Christmas-and-Chanukah/#comments</comments> 		<pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2014 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate> 		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Nicole Dieker]]></dc:creator> 				<category><![CDATA[Craft]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[gifts for writers]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[writing life]]></category> 		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://thewritelife.com/?p=4172</guid> 		<description><![CDATA[<p>Here’s our list of great gift ideas for the writer in your life.</p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/80036664/0/thewritelife~Gifts-for-Writers-Fun-Ideas-for-Christmas-and-Chanukah/">23 Gifts for Writers: Fun Ideas for Christmas and Chanukah</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://thewritelife.com">The Write Life</a>.</p> ]]><![CDATA[<div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a title="Like on Facebook" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/80036664/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Share on Google+" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/80036664/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Pin it!" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/80036664/thewritelife,http%3a%2f%2ftwlcdn.socialexis.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f11%2fScreen-Shot-2014-11-25-at-4.15.45-PM-300x196.png"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Tweet This" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/80036664/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Subscribe by RSS" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/80036664/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;</div>]]></description> 				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<input class="jpibfi" type="hidden" ><p>Don’t know what to buy for the writer in your life?

I’d love to see any of these wrapped up with my name on it this holiday season! Most of these gifts are affordable and make excellent stocking stuffers, although we’ve included a few pricier gift ideas as well &#8212; hey, writers can dream, can’t they?</p> <p>If you still want more ideas after browsing this list, hop over to last year&#8217;s list of the <a title="22 Gifts for Writers That Are Way Better Than a Boring Old Notebook" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/22-gifts-for-writers-that-are-way-better-than-a-boring-old-notebook/" target="_blank">best gifts for writers</a>.</p> <h2><b>1. Evernote Premium</b></h2> <p>Let’s start this list with a great organizational tool: <a title="Evernote Premium" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~evernote.com/premium/?utm_expid=6007595-70.9HQlnn93TgKg-a8PyRYkvA.0" target="_blank">Evernote Premium</a>.

Work online or offline with ease and have all of your information right where you need it.</p> <p>How do we know that writers want Evernote Premium in their holiday gift boxes this year?

Laptop sticker</b></h2> <p>A writer’s laptop is often the equivalent of his or her corner office. Open that laptop up at home, at a coffee shop or on a plane, and it’s like you’ve created a pop-up workspace.</p> <p>So why not decorate that office with a fun great laptop sticker? You can get the classic <a title="Snow White Holds Apple" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HQTKFD0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00HQTKFD0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=ITR4GGILEWWJFJT4" target="_blank">Snow White Holds Apple</a> sticker for a MacBook, or find out your writer’s favorite artist and get a themed sticker, like this Scott Lava <a title="Return of the Great Showdowns" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~nuvango.com/scottcampbell/great-showdowns/11-inch-apple-macbook-air" target="_blank">Return of the Great Showdowns</a> sticker (hint hint)!</p> <h2><b>3.

Accoutrements makes a variety of writer action figures, including <a title="Jane Austen Action Figure" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H5E345C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00H5E345C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=2NDROI7R7CQL6YSM" target="_blank">Jane Austen</a>, <a title="Shakespeare Action Figure" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H5E36DW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00H5E36DW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=TPXBT7B64WDUOC3G" target="_blank">Shakespeare</a> and <a title="Edgar Allen Poe Action Figure" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GWLPXI0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00GWLPXI0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=XLQVBPI7EALCGXS4" target="_blank">Edgar Allen Poe</a>.</p> <p>Your writer will enjoy posing the figure on his or her writing desk, or, you know, making Jane Austen fight a toy dinosaur. (I’d totally do that.)</p> <h2><b>4. Fancy notebook</b></h2> <p>Chances are, your writer has a notebook that he or she carries at all times. I never let my notebook out of sight; I even put it next to me when I sleep!</p> <p>Most writers love the <a title="Moleskine" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/8883701003/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=8883701003&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=4DMQR3HAATBGDC4Y" target="_blank">classic Moleskine notebook</a>, and since it’s nicer than the run-of-the-mill legal pad, it makes a great gift.

Fancy pen</b></h2> <p>What better to go with a fancy notebook than a fancy pen? A quick trip to your local pen shop or stationery store will give you a plethora of pen options.</p> <p>Or, go the extra mile and find out which pen your writer prefers. We all have a favorite, after all. I only purchase <a title="Pilot G2 Rollerball Pens" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GAOTSW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001GAOTSW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=CVXWHNOVCSDDBRKN" target="_blank">Pilot G2 Rollerball Pens</a> for myself, so I would very much appreciate a box of those under the tree this holiday season.</p> <h2><b><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007136E0O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B007136E0O&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=4NBVQBDVDQJE353G" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4183" src="http://twlcdn.socialexis.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/skullcandy-259x300.png" alt="Best gifts for writers: Skullcandy earbuds" width="200" height="232" /></a>6. Earbuds</b></h2> <p>We all know writers who can’t work without tunes. Plugging in to Pandora, Spotify or iTunes is a great way to get things done, but it also means writers sometimes go through a pair or two of earbuds a year.</p> <p>So stuff your favorite writer’s stocking with a pair of high-quality earbuds. I swear by Skullcandy, so I’d love a pair of <a title="Skullcandy’s Ink’d 2.0 Earbud Headphones" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007136E0O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B007136E0O&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=4NBVQBDVDQJE353G" target="_blank">Skullcandy’s Ink’d 2.0 Earbud Headphones</a>.

Coffee gift card</b></h2> <p>Yes, writers love their coffee &#8212; and their coffee shops, which are often one of the best places to <a title="Is a Coworking Space Better for Freelancers Than Working from Home?" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/coworking-space-better-than-working-from-home/" target="_blank">get work done</a>. (I don’t know why. Maybe it’s the comfortable chairs, or the comfort of being surrounded by other people tapping on laptops.)</p> <p>So give your writer a <a title="Starbucks card" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AR51Y5I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00AR51Y5I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=6ETGOBETP6XCDONZ" target="_blank">Starbucks card</a> or a gift card to their favorite local coffee shop.

I had just published my book, <a title="101 Weird Ways to Make Money" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118014189/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1118014189&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=REMSQS5RY7CGRRKS" target="_blank"><i>101 Weird Ways to Make Money</i></a>, and my publisher’s publicist arranged for me to create an article and slideshow for The Huffington Post on<a title="10 Weird Jobs You Can Turn Into Businesses" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-gillman/10-weird-jobs-you-can-tur_b_926954.html" target="_blank"> weird jobs that can become businesses</a>.</p> <p>In that article, I linked to <a title="Every Way to Make Money" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.everywaytomakemoney.com" target="_blank">my website</a>, which had been seeing between 700 and 1,000 page views and earning between $12 and $30 daily through Google AdSense, with an average of $20 per day.</p> <p>Here’s the traffic and revenue I earned the day the article ran (Monday, August 15, 2011) and the following days:</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4196" src="http://twlcdn.socialexis.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-25-at-5.29.05-PM.png" alt="Huffington Post blog traffic" width="293" height="178" /></p> <p>After Thursday, the numbers resumed their normal range, though my traffic stayed slightly higher, with 1,200 to 1,500 daily page views. But revenue of $531, instead of the $80 I would normally have earned in four days, suggests <b>the traffic from The Huffington Post link was worth at least $450</b>. Not bad for one post!</p> <p>In addition, my website includes links to several of my other sites, so I&#8217;m sure I picked up another $50 worth of indirect traffic for those sites. And I linked to my book in the article and author bio, so I sold quite a few copies that week.</p> <p><b>All together, that article and slideshow on The Huffington Post was probably worth $800 in additional income within a few days</b>. In addition, it helped me attract visitors to my sites and promote sales of my book for several months.</p> <p>It was a (very busy) year before I realized I had not just a post, but my own blog set up on The Huffington Post. I requested my password and started posting occasionally. The results were never as dramatic as that first post, but I did see increased traffic and book sales. And best of all, the editors never objected to my posts containing relevant links to my own websites.</p> <h2><b>How to Earn Money by Writing for Free</b></h2> <p>While The Huffington Post does not generally pay its bloggers, as my experience demonstrates, it’s still possible to earn cash by writing for free. Here are the strategies I used:</p> <h3>Include specific, valuable links</h3> <p>To start, <b>be strategic when choosing links to include in your author bio.</b> For example, if you’ve written a book or created a course, link to that. If you’re a freelance writer, you&#8217;ll want to link to your <a title="An Online Portfolio Can Change Your Career: 10 Writer Websites We Love" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/writer-websites/" target="_blank">writer website</a> or <a title="7 Great Portfolio Sites for Freelance Writers (And Most are Free)" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/freelance-portfolio-sites/" target="_blank">online portfolio</a>. If you’ve monetized a website with affiliate products or pay-per-click advertising, link to it.</p> <p>In addition, if any of these links are relevant to your post’s content, include them on related anchor text in the body of your post. I’ll reiterate: the links must be <i>relevant</i>. If they’re not, the editors will likely remove them.</p> <h3>Aim for the front page</h3> <p>For these links to be valuable, a lot of people need to see and click them, which means you&#8217;ll need a lot of readers. I was a extremely lucky with my first post; it was featured on the front page of the <a title="HuffPost Small Business" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.huffingtonpost.com/small-business/" target="_blank">HuffPost Small Business</a> section, which brought in a ton of readers. Later posts never approached that level of traffic.</p> <p>With these results in mind, it can’t hurt to aim for this special treatment. Look at what&#8217;s being shared on your targeted section&#8217;s front page. Are the featured articles controversial or fun? Are they short or long? Do they have shocking titles?</p> <p>Many big names blog on The Huffington Post, so competition for better placement is tough. When former Secretary of Labor<a title="Robert Reich" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-reich/" target="_blank"> Robert Reich&#8217;s post</a> is on the front page of the Politics section, yours isn&#8217;t likely to push his aside. On the other hand, he doesn&#8217;t write every day. If you’re working in a section with fewer big names, you might have an even better chance to get a good post featured. Study your targeted section to learn the famous bloggers in your niche and how often they post.</p> <h3>Share your post as much as possible</h3> <p>Promote your post to your own networks to direct as much traffic to it as possible, as you would with any guest post. Share it with your Facebook and Twitter followers, write a short blurb about it on your blog or email it to your newsletter subscribers.</p> <p>With a bit of luck, your HuffPo post might even go viral. Blogger <a title="How to Get a Blog Post Published on The Huffington Post" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.carefulcents.com/get-published-on-the-huffington-post/" target="_blank">Catherine Alford</a> was lucky enough to see her recent post blow up:</p> <blockquote><p><i>[It] went hugely viral with more than 220,000 likes and 43,000+ shares. That viral post also led to me getting interviewed on Huffington Post Live, which led to tons of emails and new readers. There’s no doubt that it’s beneficial to any writing career to be an author there.</i></p></blockquote> <p>Whether or not your post goes viral, you’ll at least point a few new readers toward your site and offerings and add &#8220;Huffington Post Blogger&#8221; to your resume.</p> <p><strong><b>If you’ve been published on The Huffington Post, how did you do it and what results did you see?

Here’s how to start from scratch.</p> <h2><b>1. Expertise: Write an “I am fabulous” statement</b></h2> <p>The goal with this step is to pump yourself up. In what specific and particular ways are you awesome? Why are you the person to write your book? Why is it the case that <a title="Why the Book Chooses the Writer — Not the Other Way Around" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/why-the-book-chooses-the-writer/" target="_blank">no one but you</a> could write your book? <b>What unique experience do you bring to the table?</b></p> <p>Even if your answer is simply that you lived the life you lived &#8212; and maybe it was a hard one &#8212; you’re awesome for having survived it. If you write fiction, your book likely involves themes or situations you know a lot about, which makes you an expert.</p> <p>Let your statement be free-flowing, but work hard to pat yourself on the back. <b>While many of us tend to undervalue our abilities,</b> <b>the first step toward being an expert is believing that you can be an expert.</b> You may have to fake it till you make it, and your “I am fabulous” statement can give you the motivation and validation you need to get there.</p> <h2><b>2. Contacts: Put together a “big mouth list”</b></h2> <p>Everyone you know is a contact. The more people you know, the more influence you have, especially if you know people in high places.</p> <p>So what if those influencers are a couple degrees of separation from you? People are surprising in how they choose to support fledgling authors. I’ve witnessed seriously established authors supporting new writers just because it feels good, and they remember what it’s like to be in your position.</p> <p>In addition to the list of people you’re connected to, create a list of people who might blurb you, from realistic to pie in the sky. Who would be your ideal reader? Who do you dream might one day recommend your book?</p> <h2><b>3. Social media: Pick two social channels</b></h2> <p>That’s right: only two. Set up a profile on each and post once a day.</p> <p>For most writers, I recommend choosing Facebook and Twitter, but if you’re into other channels or options, give them a shot. If you’re writing something that lends itself to images, join Pinterest. If your work lends itself to video, do YouTube. Experiment to find a <a title="Yes, Fiction Writers Can Develop Awesome Online Platforms, Too" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/yes-fiction-writers-can-develop-awesome-online-platforms-too/" target="_blank">social media channel</a> that works for you and your writing.</p> <p><b>The key to <a title="How Successful Authors Use Social Media to Sell More Books" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/how-successful-authors-use-social-media-to-sell-more-books/" target="_blank">social media</a> is posting regularly and engaging people.</b> You want shares, because shares lead to more follows. Rather than spreading yourself thin across multiple platforms, focus consistently on the two platforms that <a title="Get the Biggest Bang for Your Social Media Buck" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/get-the-biggest-bang-for-your-social-media-buck/" target="_blank">provide the most value</a> to you and your work.</p> <p>It takes forever (seriously) to build up a following on social media, so don’t be discouraged. Celebrate a few likes a week. Manage your expectations. Keep going. <b>Building an author platform is a marathon, not a sprint. </b></p> <div class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%E2%80%9CBuilding+an+author+platform+is+a+marathon%2C+not+a+sprint%2C%E2%80%9D+says+%40brooke_warner&via=thewritelife&related=thewritelife&url=http://thewritelife.com/build-author-platform-7-manageable-ways-start-scratch/&naytev_force=true' target='_blank'>“Building an author platform is a marathon, not a sprint,” says @brooke_warner</a></span><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%E2%80%9CBuilding+an+author+platform+is+a+marathon%2C+not+a+sprint%2C%E2%80%9D+says+%40brooke_warner&via=thewritelife&related=thewritelife&url=http://thewritelife.com/build-author-platform-7-manageable-ways-start-scratch/&naytev_force=true' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'>Click To Tweet</a></div> <h2><b>4. Previous media and books: Publish an ebook</b></h2> <p>If you’re starting at zero, you may not have any previously published books or media, like guest posts or podcast interviews. That’s okay.</p> <p>If you’re working on a book project that you know is going to take some time to complete &#8212; a novel or a memoir that’s already been in progress for a few years, for instance &#8212; then write a shorter ebook!</p> <p>It’s surprisingly easy to <a title="What You Should Know Before Publishing Your First Ebook" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/what-you-should-know-before-publishing-your-first-ebook/" target="_blank">self-publish an ebook</a>. You want it to be high quality, with great content, a compelling cover and a well-designed interior. Using Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, Kobo, iBooks, or e-junkie you can promote and sell your ebook from your website. While marketing your ebook is a topic for another post, shepherding a short ebook to publication is a fairly simple process. And voila, you have a book to propel future books.</p> <p>Media opportunities will come, but any interview you do, blog post you write or opportunity to speak in front of people you come across qualifies as media. <b>Don’t be afraid to showcase these successes on your website and social media channels.</b></p> <p>It takes a major shift in consciousness to start <a title="5 Marketing Strategies for Writers Who Hate Promoting Their Own Work" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/marketing-strategies-for-writers/" target="_blank">self-promoting</a>, but I’ve found the key is in the balance. It’s cool to self-promote if you’re giving your readership fantastic, smart and interesting content &#8212; <a title="The One Big Reason Some Blogs Succeed, While Others Crash and Burn" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/one-big-reason-blogs-succeed/" target="_blank">providing value</a>. And it will get more comfortable with practice, I promise.</p> <h2><b>5. Personality: Figure out your persona</b></h2> <p>Jeff VanderMeer’s <a title="Booklife: Strategies and Survivial Tips for the 21st-Century Writer: Jeff VanderMeer" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/1892391902/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1892391902&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=LP3L4BKJDBC6FXUU" target="_blank"><i>Booklife</i></a> helped me understand the value of figuring out who you are online.</p> <p>Some people put it all out there and are wholly themselves online, while others choose to <a title="How One Author Learned to Love Social Media (After Really, Truly Hating It)" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/how-one-author-learned-to-love-social-media/" target="_blank">create a persona</a> different from who they are in real life or only show a certain side of themselves. You get to decide, and you’re not wrong or weird or bad if you want to retain a little privacy.</p> <p>However, <b>being private or an introvert does </b><b><i>not</i></b><b> mean you should not have a website, or that you can get away with pooh-poohing the importance of an author platform.</b> It just means you get to set boundaries. Instead of holding technology in contempt, learn to work with what you might not like, and to figure out how to make it work for you.</p> <h2><b>6. Existing readership: Create a sign-up form on your website</b></h2> <p>What? You don’t have a <a title="Without This, You’ll Never Succeed as a Writer" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/without-this-youll-never-succeed-as-a-writer/" target="_blank">website</a> yet? OK, the first step is to set up your new site.</p> <p>While you’re at it, create a sign-up form that connects to an email management system like <a title="Send Better Email | MailChimp" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~eepurl.com/Pvrg1" target="_blank">MailChimp</a> or <a title="Email Marketing Services - iContact" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.icontact.com/" target="_blank">iContact</a>. Put it on your homepage (or if you’re feeling fancy, a <a title="What is a Landing Page? A Fast Way to Grow Your Blog and Business" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/landing-page/" target="_blank">landing page</a>) to capture email addresses &#8212; and take a deep breath.</p> <p>Authors often tell me that people they know already have too much email. Get over it. Seriously. Your job is to collect emails, and to send out worthwhile content. It may take a long time to build up your email list, and to figure out exactly what your message is, but you need to practice having a following.</p> <p><b>It doesn’t matter if you launch your email list with 20 people on it. That’s exactly what I did, and four years later I’m publishing for 5,000 subscribers</b> who want to hear from me. After all, if they don’t, they can opt out.</p> <p>But don’t worry about the numbers for now. Just take the first step and set up the form.</p> <h2><b>7. Ability to execute: Stick to a schedule </b></h2> <p>The ability to execute, like personality, is sort of a “soft” aspect of author platform, but it matters. It’s about follow-through and the ability to stick to a commitment to create content. It’s about consistency, and showing up even if it seems like no one is listening.</p> <p>Building an author platform is grueling work, but it’s truly rewarding when you see the occasional spikes in engagement or new followers, or the payoff in the form of positive feedback or sales.</p> <p>This payoff can only happen if you execute a plan and stick to it.</p> <p>I <i>know</i> it’s a long haul. I’m out there myself, working on my platform every day, sometimes wondering why I am putting so much effort toward all this personal branding. But if you want to publish, and if you want readers, you have to find a voice, write content, connect with your readers and put yourself out there.</p> <p>Your hard work will pay off; it just takes some time. <b>Give it time and figure out a schedule that works for you.</b> I recommend blogging once a month and posting on social media once a day, to start. You might increase from there, but again, you can take it little by little and adjust your plan as you figure it out.</p> <h2><b>What I know about author platform</b></h2> <p>Just like you don’t run a marathon without training for weeks or months, you don’t start your author platform full force. Building your platform takes discipline and hard work, but if it weren’t worth it, no one would be doing it.</p> <p>The key is to find genuine value in your endeavors. Keep going, even when it feels like no one is listening. Eventually people will start to listen, and eventually you will get a comment to a post that makes you realize you’re making a difference, reach a milestone with your contacts that surprises you, or connect with a high-profile writer who supports you just because.</p> <p>Have faith. Work hard. Don’t dismiss these ideas just because they feel like too much effort, or because starting from zero seems daunting. <b>Everyone started from zero, even your literary heroes.</b> And it’s only with hindsight and effort that anyone has the wisdom to promise that it’s worth it.</p> <p>I promise, it is. Come on in and test the waters. Wade in slowly. You’ll find your way.</p> <p><b>What was the first thing you did to build your author platform?
