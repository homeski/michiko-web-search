</p><p>With snowstorms and flooding, it&#8217;s been quite a week, hasn&#8217;t it? While we can&#8217;t rely on the weather, we can depend on a steady supply of great articles on writing and self-publishing. I&#8217;ve picked out some of the best from this week to share with you. Hope you find them interesting!</p>

&#8220;Facebook has more than 1 billion users worldwide, and it ranks as the No. 1 site (or No. 2, depending on whom you ask) in the United States. For this reason alone, it’s often one of the first topics of conversation when discussing an online marketing plan or author platform. Should it be?&#8221;</p>

&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ve just finished that NaNo novel and you know you want to publish, so you&#8217;d like to get a head start while you slog through the editing process.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;Not everyone will like your book. And sometimes, you may end up with a one-star review. I’ve been there, and initially it feels like a punch in the gut. So what’s the best way to deal with a negative review? Respond? Ignore? Take the feedback into consideration?&#8221;</p>

&#8220;One of the best ways aspiring authors can develop successful writing careers is to listen to and apply advice from successful authors. Regardless of genre, or whether they write fiction and nonfiction, authors starting out in this brave new world of publishing can benefit from the generous sharing of tips by today’s pros.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;Two years ago I posted a set of New Year’s resolutions for writers, which was well enough received that I posted another set of resolutions the following December. This holiday season, since I’m all about tradition (as opposed to being all about that bass), I’ve assembled several more resolutions for writers to consider as the new year approaches.&#8221;</p>

Awesome!" /></a>
</p><p>By <a href="http://twitter.com/caballofrances" target="_blank">Frances Caballo</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor.</em><br />
—Truman Capote</p>
<p>Who likes to fail?</p>
<p>No one, right?</p>
<p>I don’t even like the synonyms for failure: tanked, bust, crashed, burned.</p>
<p>They make it sound as though you can’t redeem yourself. As though along with failing, that failure itself signifies a finality to your endeavor.</p>
<p>The opposite is true. Failure always brings us to new beginnings.</p>
<p>That “new beginning” stuff sounds like a platitude and when we’re depressed about our defeat.</p>
<p>But it’s more than a platitude. It’s the truth.</p>
<p>I was fired once over a philosophical belief. It’s a long story (it always is). The short story is that I held a certain belief that my board of directors didn’t endorse.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I was without a job.</p>
<p>I went through the usual turmoil of anger and resentment. To friends I said, “How could they?” “You won’t believe what they said!” “They can’t be serious.”</p>
<p>Well, they were serious.</p>
<p>So I painted some rooms and thought about my future. During those months, I decided to launch my own business and here I am today.</p>
<p>I’m happier now than if I had continued in that job. And that’s the truth too.</p>
<h3>How to Rise from Failure</h3>
<p>So how does this blog post apply to you? Good question. Failure comes in different shades and degrees and applies to different layers of life.</p>
<p><strong>Failure as an Author</strong></p>
<p>Do you ever feel as though you’re failing as an author? Take these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign up for a writer’s conference.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Hire the best developmental editor you can afford.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Take workshops to help you develop your craft.</li>
<p></p>
<li>If you write nonfiction, hire a book coach.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Sign up for webinars and teleseminars on craft.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Write another book.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Try a different genre.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Write some poetry.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Read great authors, you know, the masters: Faulkner, Woolf, Hemingway, Chekov.</li>
<p>
</ol>
<p><strong>Failure as a Marketer</strong></p>
<p>Let’s face it; if you’re an Indie writer, you’re also a marketer. If you want your books to sell, you’ve got to put some energy into building your platform.</p>
<p>Authors new to marketing worry about mistakes. Here’s the truth: we’ve all made them, and they can all be corrected or at least ameliorated.</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you select the wrong Twitter handle? That’s easily taken care of. Just log into your twitter account and change it. Then remember to change it everywhere else, such as your blog, website, email signature, business cards, etc.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Would you like to start over with your Facebook page? Unless you have a thousand or more page Likes, delete it and start over.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Is your book priced too high? Log into CreateSpace, KDP or IngramSpark and lower the price.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Did you send a tweet you wished you hadn’t? Follow these directions:
<ol type="a">
<li>Visit your Profile page.</li>
<li>Locate the Tweet you want to delete.</li>
<li>Click the More or ellipsis icon ( ••• ).</li>
<li>Click Delete Tweet.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<p></p>
<li>You can remove items from your Facebook Timeline, but that won’t negate the fact that they’re already in your fans’ and friends’ news feeds. To get rid of status updates from your Timeline:
<ol type="a">
<li>Hover over the post on your Page’s Timeline.</li>
<li>Click the arrow in the top-right corner of your post.</li>
<li>Select Hide from Page or Delete Photo, which will delete the entire post and image.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<p></p>
<li>Do you want to start all over with Twitter? Cancel your current account and start anew.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Are you beating yourself up because you didn’t send a press release when you launched your book? Write one and send it today.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Do you wish you had chosen a different domain name or chosen another WordPress theme? Hire a web developer, select a new theme, buy a new domain and transfer the content.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Have you been promoting your books too frequently on social media? Stop. Adopt the 80/20 rule: 80 percent of the time post quotes, images and content from other writers and 20 percent of the time promote your stuff.</li>
<p>
<span id="more-34866"></span></p>
<li>Do you hate your profile image? Ask a friend to spend some time with you taking new shots, and then use PicMonkey.com to edit the image.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Join a LinkedIn or Facebook group or a Google+ Community to learn more and develop your marketing skills.</li>
<p></p>
</ol>
<h3>How to Avoid Social Media Gaffes</h3>
<p>There’s only one way to prevent a serious gaffe on social media. Self-reflect before you self-reveal. Ask yourself if what you’re about to post would be something you wouldn’t want your employer, rabbi or pastor to see.</p>
<p>If you make other errors, they can almost always be corrected to some degree.</p>
<p>Just try not to worry about errors. Venture out onto the social web, create some profiles, read blogs and try to improve your skills over time.</p>
<p>Remember, others will be far more forgiving of the errors you make than you will. So cut yourself some slack, experiment with your content, and have fun.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="post_image_link" href="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/2014/12/what-every-indie-author-needs-to-know-about-their-books-landing-page-free-webinar-invitation/" title="Permanent link to What Every Indie Author Needs to Know About Their Book’s Landing Page [Free Webinar Invitation]"><img class="post_image aligncenter" src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bigstock-The-launch-against-the-sky-60904964.jpg" width="530" height="275" alt="Post image for What Every Indie Author Needs to Know About Their Book’s Landing Page [Free Webinar Invitation]" /></a>
</p><p>When I first started learning about internet marketing, I heard this phrase “landing page” a lot. What’s a landing page anyway?</p>
<p>And why would an author need to know about it, whatever it is?</p>
<p>I quickly found out that “landing page” can be any web page, on a free-standing website, on a blog site, or anyplace else that’s used as a destination to send people.</p>
<p>It’s where you want them to “land.”</p>
<p>For instance, if I’m going to lead a group of authors on a tour of the best pubs in Amsterdam (commonly known as a “pub crawl”) I might set up a page on my blog describing the trip, telling people why it’s going to be a great experience, and providing a way for them to get more information or sign up to participate.</p>
<p>This will become the “landing page” for that tour.</p>
<p>It’s where I’ll send anyone who asks about it, I’ll link to it in any articles I write about the tour, and I’ll include it in any emails I send out letting people know about this unique opportunity.</p>
<h3>Unfortunately, Books Don’t Sell Themselves</h3>
<p>You can see that having a landing page for a product or service or special event makes the marketing a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>And that’s why more authors should be using landing pages for their books, especially when it comes time to dive into your book launch.</p>
<p>All too often authors skip this step, and do something else instead, like:<br />
<span id="more-35049"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Write a blog post about the book</li>
<li>Create an “ad” and put it into the sidebar of their blog</li>
<li>Add it to a big “books” page on their website</li>
</ul>
<p>But none of those things, good though they are, can replace the efficiency and marketing power of a dedicated landing page.</p>
<p>Until now, creating your own landing page hasn’t really been all that easy for most authors. If you try (and I have) you’ll run into problems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>having difficulty making a page your WordPress site that looks and functions properly. You can spend many hours wrestling with this and still end up with something that doesn’t work the way you want it to</li>
<li>buying special software that promises to let you design your own web page, but in fact becomes yet another tool you have to invest time in to learn how to use</li>
<li>hiring a designer or developer to create a page for you, with numerous meetings and lots of development time, not to mention what could be a significant cost</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are new solutions coming onto the market all the time, and one I’m pretty excited about is Booklaunch.io.</p>
<p>This looks like about the best solution for authors who want to quickly and inexpensively set up landing pages for their books, and I can’t wait to tell you more about it.</p>
<p>So if you want to know the kinds of things that go into an effective landing page, and how having one can help your book marketing efforts, there are 2 things you can do right now:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check out the great series of articles Kim Grabas has been posting about book launch landing pages here: <a href="http://www.yourwriterplatform.com/book-launch-with-a-bang/">Your Writer Platform: Want to Launch Your Book With a Bang? Then You Need This</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>

Ben will break down for us why authors need landing pages, what should be on them, and demonstrate this a great new solution for indie authors who want to save time and spur sales of their books.</p>
</li>
