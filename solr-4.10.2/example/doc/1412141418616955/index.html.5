				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year is almost over, and that means it's time to evaluate progress and set goals for the New Year. So today I'd like to share an example with a follow-up from my previous progress check-in and also some new goals for my writing business in 2015.</p>
<h2>2014 Year-End Check-In</h2>
<p>This year was very good in some ways. But in others I didn't come close to meeting my goals. A lot of that was poor planning on my part. While I'm a bit of an organization junkie, my biggest issue was with my indie publishing projects -- mostly knocking out first drafts on shorter work. And the problem came in the planning.</p>
<p>While I have a five-year publishing plan in place, that plan was based on projects-per-quarter. What I should have done was map out a more specific schedule by the month, or even the week. That's changing, and I'm working on a plan like that for 2015's first quarter before I finish up work for this year (through the end of next week).</p>
<p>Here are some of the goals left from my <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/2014-writing-goals-3rd-quarter/">third quarter check-in</a> and what I did, and didn't, get finished:</p>
<h3>1. Limit client projects to two working days per week.</h3>
<p>I cut this back to three working days per week at the beginning of 2014 and planned to cut back to two days per week by the end of the year (planning to make the change on my website right before the first of the New Year).</p>
<p>I don't expect this to happen right away. That's a result of some new ongoing work I picked up recently. And I suspect pushing regulars into two working days per week would be a bit tight right now. If I or a client decide to cancel one of those regular gigs in the future, I'll likely take that opportunity to scale back my client-focused working days, but I'm not going to force it at the start of the year.</p>
<h3>2. Start posting to my business blog at least once per month.</h3>
<p>In my last check-in I mentioned wanting to pre-write posts so I couldn't let this slide. And that's exactly what I did. So I'm happy to say I'm on this schedule. And I intend to stick with pre-writing post batches on at least a quarterly basis to make sure I stay there.</p>
<h3>3. Post to my genealogy blog at least twice per month.</h3>
<p>I decided to change this to a monthly posting schedule, and like I did with my business blog, I pre-wrote content for the last quarter of 2014. Again, I intend to continue doing that into the new year with one post per month.</p>
<h3>4. Release one or two e-courses at All Indie Writers by year's end.</h3>
<p>This was an adjustment to my original goal of launching three this year. But as I said in my last update, one to two is more likely. And it's looking like it'll only be one. There are near constant updates to the new e-course platform, including some recent major ones. So I need to make sure they won't affect anything in the first free course's setup. Barring any problems with that, the first one will be scheduled for release either at the end of next week or it will come out while I'm on vacation later this month.</p>
<h3>5. Revise my first mystery novel.</h3>
<p>The revisions have become more of a full rewrite. They're coming along, but they won't be finished by the end of this month. I decided to re-outline the story from its first draft, this time using the Snowflake Method. So far it's helping me with the pacing, but there are still a few big problem areas I need to re-work.</p>
<h3>6. Release three more e-books this year.</h3>
<p>This didn't happen, though one more short one should be released here by the end of next week. There's a <em>slight </em>chance that two will be ready, but I'm not counting on it.</p>
<h3>7. Draft my first horror novel.</h3>
<p>While the first draft isn't finished, I did write a little over 50,000 words for this novel during NaNoWriMo this year. And I plan to pick it up again in January, with an estimated final word count of around 80,000 words.</p>
<h3>8. Launch the podcast and release the new design at All Indie Writers.</h3>
<p>Both of these goals were met.</p>
<p>I had also planned to spend more time on picture book manuscripts and my short stories and flash fiction. But I simply didn't have as much time for them as I'd hoped.</p>
<h2>2015 Writing and Publishing Goals</h2>
<p>I'm not going to go into as much depth as usual with next year's goals, but here's a summary for you with some of my biggest goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given that I'm not cutting another day from client projects right away, I expect to see at least a 25% increase in my freelance income. But if I'm going to keep devoting extra time to these projects (and away from my own, which is the overall direction I'm heading), my ideal goal is to see more like a 40-50% increase over this year's freelance earnings.</li>
<li>Finish the first draft of my first horror novel in January, and get through at least one comprehensive revision by year's end.</li>
<li>Get through 2-3 revisions of my first mystery novel so I can get it into the hands of a developmental editor by year's end (though by the end of the summer would be nice). I'm not going to stress over the first game tied to this series yet -- I'll add that later in the year if I get the novel into an editor's hands, assuming the editor I want is even free then.</li>
<li>Launch QuickMystery.com to feature flash fiction, and draft enough flash fiction to cover at least weekly posts from the time the site launches through the end of 2015. Ideally I'd like to launch this site by the end of March at the latest.</li>
<li>Overhaul my 5 Year Publishing plan to create a stricter, deadline-oriented project calendar rather than its current quarterly breakdown.</li>
<li>Conduct a complete content audit and massive overhaul of my small business niche blog. Nearly every post is expected to undergo revisions or even removal if they're too dated to be saved.</li>
<li>Some big changes are coming to my business site. It's already resource-heavy compared to most freelancers' client-targeted sites, but in 2015 it'll become even more focused on prospect-focused resources.</li>
<li>I won't go into the details here, but I have a lot of administrative work and improvements scheduled here as well -- from back-end improvements to new freebies and a few premium additions.</li>
</ul>
<p>My full goal list also includes picture book manuscripts (less of a priority in 2015), short stories, and several new sites I plan to launch (not necessarily blogs, so most of their work is in the development stage). I also plan to get through the rough draft of at least two novels -- the next mystery and one under one of my private, more experimental, pen names.</p>
<p>What about you? Have you reviewed your progress this year yet? Have you set your 2015 writing or publishing goals? Tell me about some of the big things you plan to accomplish next year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I'd like to tackle a reader question from Evgeni Puzankov related to selling writing to English-language publications when English isn't your first language. Can you do so successfully?</p>
<blockquote><p>"The question that plagues me throughout my adult life is whether one can actually make it in anglophone writing biz, while not being a native.</p>
<p>I'm Russian and still live here. My mother sent me to English classes when I was about 4 and it was the beginning of my downfall. Now I'm 25 and have this dream to get at least one short story written in English published.</p>
<p>Is there any chance for me despite my nationality?"</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Short Answer</h2>
<p>Yes! You can absolutely succeed in English-language markets even if English isn't your first language, no matter where you live. Writers do it all the time. I know successful writers from Pakistan, India, Italy, and numerous other countries who work with English-language markets. And if you read their work, you probably wouldn't even know English wasn't their first language.</p>
<p>That's the key. If you're targeting publications that cater to English-speaking <em>readers</em>, your work needs to be on par with what they're used to.</p>
<h2>Tips on Succeeding in English-language Markets</h2>
<p>While you can certainly succeed writing in English (or in any language you might be fluent in, even if it's not your first language), that doesn't mean it will always be easy. Here are a few tips that might help:</p>
<h3>1. Read as much as possible in the language you plan to write in.</h3>
<p>Better yet, read as much as you can from past issues of the publications you plan to target. Compare the style of your writing to the stories they've already published. You'll have a better chance of landing a contract if your styles are a good fit for each other.</p>
<h3>2. Make sure you can accept payments from your target publication's country.</h3>
<p>For example, make sure your bank can process a check in their local currency, and find out if the transaction fees are reasonable enough compared to the pay rate to be worth it. You can also look into online payment processors available in your country, like PayPal. Most of my work comes from overseas clients, and this is the route we usually take. It shouldn't be a problem for most online publications, but it might be more difficult to get offline publications to pay you through these kinds of services.</p>
<h3>3. Join a writing group with native English speakers.</h3>
<p>There are some common giveaways when a writer isn't a native English speaker. In the worst cases, the writing is barely readable to English-speaking readers. But sometimes those giveaways are more subtle, such as using very formal language in markets where people are used to stories written in a more conversational tone.</p>
<p>Sometimes these issues won't be clear to you because you know what your words meant. By joining a writing group you get feedback from others before pitching your stories to publications. That can help you sort out problems, big and small, before your work is reviewed by an editor. The better your first impression is, the less likely an editor should be to care about your location.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean you can be published by all publications in your target country. Some hire only local or regional writers. And others will only hire writers from their own country or a small group of countries for tax or payment reasons.</p>
<p>Now, a question for the All Indie Writers community: Have any of you been through this, pitching work in a language other than your first? If you've done so successfully, what tips would you offer Evgeni?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The end of the year is right around the corner. Are you ready?</p>
<p>While you might be itching to take some time off over the holidays, December can also be a busy time for work. Freelance clients often order more to use up the current year's budget. You're probably at the end of the fiscal year for your writing or publishing business. And it's time to think about the New Year and what changes you need to make to stay on track for your long-term goals.</p>
<p>It's never too late to work to improve your writing business. And here are three things you can do this month to make the most of the time you have left in the year.</p>
<h2>1.Reevaluate your business and marketing plans.</h2>
<p>Go over your business plan and marketing plan. What worked? What didn't? Are there new marketing tactics that would better serve your overall strategy? Do you need to adjust your marketing, publishing, or other budgets? Do you need to re-think your target market?</p>
<p>Ask yourself questions like these as you review your plans, and make any adjustments you feel are necessary.</p>
<h2>2. Come up with yearly goals.</h2>
<p>Don't wait for the New Year to come along to set new goals. These should fit within your larger business and marketing plans, but they should be things you can realistically tackle over the course of a year. For example, you might set a target launch date for your next book. Or you might set new yearly income goals for your freelance writing services. Or you might set traffic goals for your blog for the year.</p>
<h2>3. Get organized.</h2>
<p>Hit the ground running in January by getting your writing business organized ahead of time. Re-organize your office or other work space. Clean up your computer files. Make improvements to your bookkeeping system. Organize your client files and contact information to help you target past clients with pitches easier in the New Year. Consider new software purchases that might help you organize and streamline your work. Come up with an editorial calendar for your blog.</p>
<p>This way when you get back to work after the holidays, you can jump right in and push forward towards your new goals.</p>
<p>These are some of the things I'll be doing this December before taking my yearly vacation time. What about you? How are you taking care of business this month to get yourself ready for the New Year?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I decided to try something new over the holiday weekend, and I'm kicking it off a bit early. I'm letting <em>you </em>decide how much you want to pay for my e-book, the <em><a href="http://allindiewriters.com/books/30-day-marketing-boot-camp-freelance-writers/">30 Day Marketing Boot Camp for Freelance Writers</a>. </em></p>
<p>This special offer will run through Cyber Monday, ending at midnight on Tuesday, December 1st.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28062" src="http://allindiewriters.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/30daybootcampcovermed.jpg" alt="30 Day Marketing Boot Camp for Freelance Writers" width="350" height="425" /></p>
<h2>What Does This Mean?</h2>
<p>Simply put, you set the price for my e-book. Do you want to pay the usual price of $9.97? You can. Would you like to pay half price over the holiday week? Then pay closer to $5. Can you only spare $.99? Then that's your price.</p>
<p>Heck, if you're not able to spare a cent right now, I get it. In that case, download the e-book for free and consider it my "thank you" gift to you for being a valued reader and community member here at All Indie Writers.</p>
<h2>How Does This Work?</h2>
<p>Here's how you can get your copy of my e-book for whatever price you decide to pay:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit the <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/books/30-day-marketing-boot-camp-freelance-writers/">e-book page</a> on this site.</li>
<li>Click the "Add to cart" button at the bottom of the page.</li>
<li>In the cart window that pops up, change the price to whatever you'd like to pay. By default, it will show the normal price of $9.97.</li>
<li>Click the "update cart" button. Make sure your new price shows up.</li>
<li>Click the "Checkout with PayPal button and follow PayPal's instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> If you enter 0.00 in the price field, you will see a generic Checkout button instead. Click that and fill out the form that comes up (it should mention my primary business name, 3 Beat Media, at the top of the page). In this form, only enter your name and email address. You can ignore any other fields e-junkie provides. Please do <em>not </em>check the box to sign up for the newsletter there. It will not actually sign you up for the All Indie Writers newsletter and blog updates (it's for customer mailings, and I don't use E-junkie's system for that).</p>
<p>This form will only affect people who opt to download the e-book for free. All others will go through a traditional PayPal payment process.</p>
<p>If you haven't checked out this e-book yet, I hope you'll take this opportunity whether you're in a position to purchase it right now or not. Consider it a sneak peek into the rest of the e-book series for freelance writers (with the next title coming before the end of this year). Or simply use it to help you plan a marketing blitz for the New Year.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the third episode of the All Indie Writers Podcast, I'm joined by <a href="http://princessjones.com">Princess Jones</a>. We chat about extreme cases of authors behaving badly by attacking negative book reviewers. And we offer tips on how you can deal with negative book reviews more tactfully (hint: there is almost <em>never </em>an appropriate time for you to take on a reviewer).</p>
<p>You can hear the latest episode below (<strong>warning: it contains profanity</strong>). Or you can read the <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/podcast/3/">show notes</a> for the important takeaways.</p>
<p>As always, your questions are welcome. Visit the main <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/podcast/">Podcast page</a> to submit questions to be answered in a future episode. The next episode, on December 4th, will be a Q&amp;A special covering blogging-related questions. Get them in my the end of November, and I'll include as many as I have time for (others will be featured in later episodes).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of late last night, All Indie Writers is sporting a new look. And I hope you like it. Today I'd like to go over a few key site updates to make sure you can still find everything you're used to.</p>
<h2>New Look, Same Basic Layout</h2>
<p>The new look for All Indie Writers was built on the same theme as the former green and black design. So most things will be accessible in the same ways -- breadcrumbs are still in the header, most of the navigation links are the same, you still log in using the same link at the top right corner of the site, and you can still search the site by clicking the same magnifying glass icon in the navigation bar.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will make for an easy transition.</p>
<p>If you're still seeing the previous design (or some elements of it), please clear your browser cache. Because the design changes were made to the existing theme, file names are the same. Therefore your browser might be serving a cached version of the site files.</p>
<h2>The Differences</h2>
<p>That said, there are several differences you should be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main contact link was moved to the navigation bar (previously it was a sub-menu item under the About page link).</li>
<li>The blog was changed from a single sidebar layout to a double-sidebar layout, and the content in the sidebars has changed. I've also widened the overall grid the site is built on, meaning we didn't lose much, if any, width for posts themselves when the new sidebar was added.</li>
<li>The left sidebar on the blog now features links to key content, broken into groups for freelance writers, indie authors, and bloggers. You'll also find a link there for the new <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/featured-content/">Featured Content</a> page that was released shortly before the design updates. This page is designed to give new readers a place to find some of the best content from the eight years of archives on this site.</li>
<li>I removed the feeds that were previously found in the footer (the jobs feed and recent posts feed can now be found in the right sidebar on blog posts).</li>
<li>There is a new envelope icon in the navigation bar. Click this to quickly subscribe to email updates. You can also find email signup forms by clicking the email subscribe link in the right column of any blog page, or by using the form at the top of the homepage. In the near future I'll also add a sign-up form below blog posts or in a new footer area.</li>
<li>If you're a member of the community and you're used to a separate breadcrumb stream right above the forums, those are now gone. Instead I've made the sitewide breadcrumbs work correctly with the forum plugin. That means you can find links to parent forums at the very top left corner of the site. I saw no point in keeping two sets of breadcrumbs on forum pages, and this gives us better consistency.</li>
<li>Breadcrumbs were also fixed to work with the new podcast custom post type, meaning when you visit podcast episode pages they'll feature a link to the parent podcast page rather than to the blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than that, things should work much as they did before.</p>
<h2>Email Subscriptions</h2>
<p>A new email subscription option was set up through MailChimp. This will subscribe you to post updates from the blog (emails go out each afternoon if there's a new post to share) as well as occasional newsletter content and special offers -- such as subscribers-only freebies and better discount codes when I run offers on e-books and future courses.</p>
<p>If you already subscribed through one of the former email subscription options (Feedblitz or Feedburner), you'll be migrated to the new system over the next week or so.</p>
<p>Let me know if you run into any trouble. I'll be introducing some other minor changes in coming weeks so, as always, if things aren't working for you, let me know and I'll look into it asap. In that case, please let me know what browser you were using when you noticed the problem. You can always reach me by leaving a comment or emailing me at <a href="mailto:jenn@allindiewriters.com">jenn@allindiewriters.com</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/podcast/2/">episode two</a> of the All Indie Writers Podcast, I put up a copy of Alicia Rades' new e-book for a giveaway. Anyone sending me a question about blogging to be answered in a future podcast episode would be entered in a drawing, and one person would win a copy.</p>
<p>I promised the results would be posted today, so here you go:</p>
<h2>The Winner(s)</h2>
<p>Only three people sent in questions for the giveaway. They were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anne Wayman</li>
<li>KeriLynn Engel</li>
<li>Emily Fowler</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of that, I changed my mind on the drawing. Instead, because there were so few entries, I decided to buy them <em>all </em>a copy of Alicia's e-book. And I hope they enjoy it as much as I did.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>At first I was disappointed by the low number of entries. But I learned a few things along the way. And as I've said before, learning is a huge benefit of failure, and if you never fail you probably aren't taking enough risks. We all make mistakes, and I hope that by sharing some of mine others can learn from them too. Here's where I went wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>I did the giveaway much too early. At only the second episode of the podcast, there simply wasn't a large enough following for something like this yet.</li>
<li>I don't think I gave people enough time. The podcast released last Thursday, and the deadline was the following Monday. Next time I'll run the giveaway over either one or two weeks to give people a chance to catch up on the episode. Rushing it was a mistake.</li>
<li>My podcast feed was broken, so subscribers didn't even receive notice that the second episode went live. In this case, the broken feed itself wasn't my fault. The account is set up for podcasting. And the individual track was set to be included in the feed. Where I <em>am </em>at fault is in not checking on the feed sooner. I figured I'd give it a few hours to update, but took a couple of days to actually check up on it, only after I saw a 75% drop in listeners. Something's screwy with SoundCloud's RSS feed and updates aren't being fed to Feedburner or iTunes. So if you subscribed after the first episode and didn't hear about the second, I apologize. I've contacted Soundcloud and am still waiting on a solution to the problem. In the meantime, you can access the episode <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/podcast/2/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you missed the giveaway period but you still have a blogging-related question you'd like me to answer, please send it to <a href="mailto:jenn@allindiewriters.com">jenn@allindiewriters.com</a> (include the word "Podcast" in the subject line somewhere). Episode four, which will be released on December 4th, will be a special Q&amp;A episode where I'll answer blogging-related questions that have come in. Between giveaway entries and a question received a bit late for that, I'm up to five so far. They're a great mix, and it should make for a great episode for new and experienced bloggers alike.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I hope you'll hang in there with me through the feed problems while I work with <a href="http://princessjones.com">Princess Jones</a> on the November 20th episode about dealing with negative book reviews. I'm looking forward to it, and I hope you are too.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/podcast/1/">first episode</a> (listen below if you missed it), I'll bring on occasional guest co-hosts for casual, frank discussions rather than taking the traditional route of bringing on interview subjects.</p>
