				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://wordservewatercooler.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/reaching-out-service.gif"><img class="alignright wp-image-15516 size-medium" src="https://wordservewatercooler.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/reaching-out-service.gif?w=300&#038;h=240" alt="reaching out to you" width="300" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>Psalm 34:17-18 <em>“The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them; he delivers them from all their troubles. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.”</em></p>
<p>This is the season of Joy. Glistening lights, happy Christmas carols, gifts given in love. But for some, the season is not as bright. For the father who is struggling to put food on the table for his children, let alone buy them Christmas gifts. For the old woman who sits in her rocking chair, her life but a memory and her children too busy to visit. For the child who wants to be a part of a loving family. For the mother who cries over the son she lost in the war.</p>
<p>For those who have gone through a year of endless trials and heartbreak and feel you have no reason to celebrate, this is for you. God is a God of love. He loves you. The Bible says He hears the prayers of His children. He knows the pain and sorrow you carry even without you telling Him. But even more so, He promises to deliver you from your troubles.</p>
<p>Even if your sorrows haven’t been as grievous, know that God has walked by your side. That He is ever faithful to love and keep you. Psalm 34 is loaded with promises from God—He answers our prayers when we seek Him, He encamps around us to protect us, His eyes and ears are attentive to our cries, and He promises to deliver us from our troubles.</p>
<p>It’s easy this time of year to get caught up in the trappings, the glitter, and the clutter and lose sight of the real reason for the season. God did not come to earth to judge us, but to save us. To lift us up when we are discouraged. To be our comforter and the lover of our souls.</p>
<p>May this holiday season be a time of refreshing for you. I pray you can leave your cares at His feet and that God’s presence will fill your hearts and souls to overflowing.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wordservewatercooler.wordpress.com/15515/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wordservewatercooler.wordpress.com/15515/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wordservewatercooler.com&#038;blog=25062307&#038;post=15515&#038;subd=wordservewatercooler&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Strange and wonderful things happen when we keep our eyes peeled, our ears sharp, our hearts welcoming, and our minds creative.</strong> This year, I met someone who at first glance was not an obvious fit with my writing life. But first glances are often wrong.</p>
<p><strong><a title="Zog the Dog" href="http://www.amazon.com/ZOG-DOG-Mary-Young/dp/0989161617/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417214395&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=zog+the+dog"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-15506" src="https://wordservewatercooler.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/zog-the-dog.jpg?w=240&#038;h=300" alt="Mary Young Zog the Dog" width="240" height="300" /></a>I am a Christian non-fiction author.</strong> The woman I met at a local women&#8217;s expo is a children&#8217;s book author. She launched as a self-publisher via <a title="Pucky Huddle Books" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pucky-Huddle-Books/296540977144341"><strong>Pucky Huddle Books</strong></a> &#8212; I have chosen the traditional route as my foundation. I&#8217;m a business coach, she married a rock star. Literally.</p>
<p>But we both live in the same tiny county.</p>
<p><strong><a title="Mary Young Pucky Huddle Books" href="http://www.puckyhuddlebooks.com">Mary Young</a> is married to <a title="Rusty Young Poco" href="https://www.facebook.com/poco.rustyyoung?fref=photo">Rusty Young</a> of country rock group <a title="Poco" href="http://www.poconut.org">Poco</a> fame. </strong>They still play for exclusive events, and tour around the country. But in their desire to escape the crazy life of frenzied fans and intense concert schedules, they built a beautiful cabin nestled about twenty minutes from where I live. On a serene hill overlooking the stunning <a title="Huzzah Creek" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huzzah_Creek">Huzzah Creek</a>, Rusty gets to relax with his music and Mary peacefully plays with her muse.</p>
<p><strong><a title="What Lies Beneath" href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Lies-Beneath-Heaven-Brothers-ebook/dp/B00MJC899Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417214326&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=what+lies+beneath+rc+woods"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-15505" src="https://wordservewatercooler.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/what-lies-beneath-rc-woods.jpg?w=209&#038;h=300" alt="RC Woods What Lies Beneath" width="209" height="300" /></a>Due to Mary&#8217;s prompting, she and I, along with local Indie author <a title="RC Woods" href="http://www.rc-woods.com">RC Woods</a>, have pooled our talents. </strong>Recently, the <a title="Crawford County Author's Group" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/292524637599438/">Crawford County Author&#8217;s Group</a> held our first event, called The Art in Writing. Three diverse but driven authors determined to learn from, promote, and support each other.</p>
<p><strong>Until recently, in our small region, we each felt alone. </strong>Let&#8217;s face it, those of us who put pen to paper or fingers to a keyboard are a strange breed to normal folks &#8212; most people don&#8217;t get the weird ways our minds work. Or sometimes, the strange hours we keep.</p>
<p><strong>When my brain fries, when my creative juices dry, when I&#8217;m too tired to think of new ways to market my books</strong>, a couple of hours with fellow writers revives my brainstorming abilities. The art in writing is not magical &#8212; it&#8217;s intentional. It&#8217;s not competitive &#8212; it&#8217;s cooperative. No matter how similarly or differently we write.</p>
<p><strong>I have other author friends who equally stir my creative brew. </strong>They don&#8217;t live close, but because of twenty-first century technology, we can call, text, private message, Facetime, or Skype. We can schedule retreats with each other, (my favorite). We can compare marketing efforts, research, and new ideas.</p>

<p><a title="WordServe Water Cooler" href="http://wordservewatercooler.com"><strong>The WordServe Water Cooler</strong></a> is another way to stay in touch with those who get the crazy business of writing. Sharing and learning with folks like you keeps my energy up when it threatens to flag. I often write about difficult subjects, so I need an occasional boost.</p>
<p><strong>No matter whether other writers live near or far, I&#8217;ve discovered I don&#8217;t do as well without them. </strong>For me, the real art in writing is community. A brother/sisterhood of folks who will pick you up when you feel down. An encouraging message, a timely quote, a pertinent fact, a social media shout-out, even insights to help you market like a rock star. The writing community is the magic behind my words.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve heard the age-old story: Creative individual decides to write a book. They sit down with paper and pen or keyboard, and painstakingly write that heart story. Sometimes it takes months. Sometimes it takes years. When talking with their friends, you often hear them say, “Something came up. It isn’t quite right yet. I just haven’t had the time.”</p>
<p>It’s pretty clear that time is precious. In fact, outside of my loved ones, my time is my most treasured possession. Since signing my first contract in January 2013, I have learned an important writing tip, probably the most important tip.</p>
<p>There is NEVER time, unless you choose to make it.</p>
<p>In fact, I’ve noticed one common trait among the published: They make time to finish. Once you sign that dotted line and make a commitment, “I didn’t have time” doesn’t fly with the publisher. Neither does “it’s just not ready yet.” You better make time and make it ready fast or risk losing your credibility.</p>
<p>After signing that contract, time to market becomes important. And time to edit. And time to promote. And time to interact with readers. Lots of time. So it’s important to figure out how to manage it.</p>
<p>My friends hear me say that I’m overwhelmed more than anything else. But I’m learning how to carve out time, discipline myself to finish, and not miss out on the world around me. We aren’t only writers. We are marketers, publicists, graphic designers, speakers, and more. So I’ve learned a few tricks to maximize my time in every area of this writing journey.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-15479 aligncenter" src="https://wordservewatercooler.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/0001-35848065.png?w=584&#038;h=584" alt="Kariss Lynch - time" width="584" height="584" /><strong>Create margin.</strong></p>
<p>I am a night owl and can write and create relevant marketing content easier when my checklist for the day is accomplished. It clears my mind to be creative. Determine your best time of day to write or create, and maximize those short windows.</p>
<p><strong>Set a timer.</strong></p>
<p>Write every day. Set the timer on your phone for an hour, then put your phone on silent and put it on the other side of the room. Clear your mind and write. I found when I did this, I could easily write close to two thousand words if not more in an hour! When the timer goes off, I feel accomplished, satisfied, and ready to write even more.</p>
<p><strong>Carve out marketing time for social media.</strong></p>
<p>I work full time as a writer for my company, so in the middle of the day I am tired of writing. I’ve started taking thirty minutes of my lunch break or fifteen minutes in the morning or afternoon to create social media graphics that I then pre-schedule so I don’t have to think about them. Think about content that is relevant to your brand, then have fun with those designs.</p>
<p><strong>Strategize for online interaction.</strong></p>
<p>The internet is a wonderful tool, but managing our online interaction can eat our time if not handled correctly. Block out thirty minutes every few days to catch up on emails. Take a few minutes to respond to every person who comments on social media (within reason of course). Know your brand, what you are passionate about, and have character and author interviews on hand for guest blog posts. Don’t overthink. Just do.</p>
<p><strong>Know your audience and limits for speaking engagements.</strong></p>
<p>My favorite interviews and speaking engagements are via Skype since it helps me conserve my time, but I’ve also enjoyed those in person speaking engagements with small groups or crowds. Determine your price (if you have one), the size of the group you are willing to speak for, if it is wise to travel or Skype in (this is great for book clubs and classes that may not be close). Bottom line, know your options and then plan accordingly. Don’t forget you still need to write and market and live life, so carefully plan the weekends you will be gone.</p>
<p>Managing time is as much mental as it is physical. At the end of the day, be satisfied with what you accomplished and leave the rest for tomorrow. What tips have you found effective in managing your time?</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wordservewatercooler.wordpress.com/15478/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wordservewatercooler.wordpress.com/15478/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wordservewatercooler.com&#038;blog=25062307&#038;post=15478&#038;subd=wordservewatercooler&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

What I didn’t realize at the time was how much readers enjoy books that take place in areas they know and how much those real places can shape what I write. Once I figured out that my real locations were one of the more powerful means of attracting readers, I began using real places as much as possible, not only for marketing later, but to provide me with inspiration for other pieces of my story.</p>
<p>As a result, I now take detailed notes of places I visit in the course of my book research. <a href="https://wordservewatercooler.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/fat-daddys-bbq-in-weslaco.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-15282" src="https://wordservewatercooler.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/fat-daddys-bbq-in-weslaco.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Fat Daddy's BBQ in Weslaco" width="300" height="225" /></a>For instance, last January, I was researching McAllen, Texas, for my next murder mystery. Since friends had recommended I try the barbeque at Fat Daddy’s, I made sure I had lunch there one day. As I ate, I observed that large groups of National Guardsmen sat at many of the tables, which I also noted in my daily travel journal, along with descriptions of the patriotic posters and flags adorning the walls. When I developed my plot, I found that the soldiers I’d seen could play into my story in a critical juncture, so I wrote them in – something I never would have come up with if I hadn’t personally visited Fat Daddy’s. Now, when anyone from the area reads the book, they’ll immediately be able to say, “this author really was here!” and it gives me the instant credibility which every fiction writer craves to lure readers into the story.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordservewatercooler.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/diner-open-sign.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-15283" src="https://wordservewatercooler.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/diner-open-sign.jpg?w=300&#038;h=214" alt="diner open sign" width="300" height="214" /></a>Another big benefit of writing real places into your books is that some readers identify so much with a favorite place, they tend to talk about your book simply because of the setting. In one of my books, I used a small diner where one of my daughters waitressed years ago. Not only did it give the story a strong local connection, but once it was published, the diner owners prominently displayed the book, which delighted all their customers, who then told their friends that their favorite diner was in a book. By using the diner as a piece of my story, I also didn’t have to think twice about what that setting would look like, because all I had to do was describe what I saw.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best guideline I can provide about using real places in your fiction is the rule my publisher gave me: If you say nice things about a place, use the real name; if you want to be negative, make up a place. That should give you more readers and happier business owners (who will become your friends if they aren’t already!), and much less chance of getting sued.</p>
<p>Who knows? You might even get a sandwich named after you…</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wordservewatercooler.wordpress.com/15281/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wordservewatercooler.wordpress.com/15281/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wordservewatercooler.com&#038;blog=25062307&#038;post=15281&#038;subd=wordservewatercooler&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Writers are dreamers. We capture daydreams in paragraphs on pages. We are also planners. We sacrifice hours now for hopes of communicating to future readers. We work in the present and have faith for the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordservewatercooler.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/istock_000003510422_medium.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15524 size-large" src="https://wordservewatercooler.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/istock_000003510422_medium.jpg?w=584&#038;h=388" alt="winter happy girl 3"   /></a></p>
<p>Dreaming, hoping, and planning are good activities. Yet, as a Christian who writes, my dreams belong to Someone greater than I am. The wise and practical words of James give me the perspective to keep my feet on the ground and remember my human limits, even as my hopes soar in faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now listen, you who say, &#8216;Today or tomorrow we will go to this city or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.&#8217; Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. Instead, you ought to say, &#8216;If it is the Lord&#8217;s will, we will live and do this or that'&#8221; (James 4:13-15).</p>
<p>Even with our best plans and the wisest advisers, we do not know what the future holds. Businesses can come and go, altering the landscape of opportunities for us. The publishing industry is constantly changing. Our favorite bookstore may go out of business before our next book ships from the warehouse. Future events may change how people view our writing. We may become the voice that speaks to current needs, or our relevance may fade.</p>
<p>Such thoughts should not put a damper on our joy as writers. Whatever the dimensions of our window of opportunity, writing is a tremendous privilege. Our books can travel to places we have never visited. We can instruct, entertain, and comfort people who may remain unknown to us. They will know us through our words. As a Christian who writes, my words reflect God&#8217;s love for people and His message of hope. The chance to become a vehicle to carry that message, however imperfectly, is a priceless gift.</p>
<p>And so, on any given day, I plan. I keep writing. I dream of reaching more people. I stack books on bookshelves in far-flung bookstores in my faith-filled imagination. I bundle up and head outside into the unknown for an adventure. I do my best and expect the best of everyone working alongside me. But I know the outcome belongs to God. His will and His plans will prevail. And that&#8217;s good news for me and for everyone else!</p>
<p>What helps you face the unknowns of life as a writer?</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wordservewatercooler.wordpress.com/15525/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wordservewatercooler.wordpress.com/15525/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wordservewatercooler.com&#038;blog=25062307&#038;post=15525&#038;subd=wordservewatercooler&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>During the holidays</strong>, my writing projects, ideas, and dreams don’t always fit into my everyday life. So, I’m forced to decide <strong>what matters most</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15451" src="https://wordservewatercooler.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_0028-version-2-1024x639.jpg?w=584&#038;h=364" alt="Photo/KarenJordan" width="584" height="364" /></p>
<p>As I prepared to lead a session on holiday traditions for a <a href="http://jordankaren.com/countdown-to-christmas-workshop/" target="_blank">“Countdown to Christmas” workshop</a> a few weeks ago, I asked myself, <em>What holiday traditions mean the most to me?</em></p>
<p>I found myself resisting the idea to plan for Christmas before Thanksgiving. I knew I didn’t have the time and energy to accomplish everything that I wanted to do, much less the things that others expected of me. And the burden of planning holiday events and activities overwhelmed me. I knew I had to be honest with myself about my expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Traditions.</strong> As I listed my family’s holiday traditions, I decided to find a new way to prioritize them. I chose three basic categories to help me sort through the chaos. I posed three questions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em> Which traditions are treasured most by my family? </em></strong>I brainstormed about our holiday activities, noting some old and new favorites—recipes, gifts, parties, and other family activities.</li>
<li><strong><em> Which traditions are the most practical for my family? </em></strong>I listed the most difficult traditions to maintain, since our children live in different cities with children of their own now—and since climbing on the roof and hanging Christmas lights are no longer options for me.</li>
<li><strong><em> Which traditions help me to communicate the “real” meaning of the holidays to those who matter most to me?</em></strong> As I examined my traditions, I wanted to be sure to include those that best expressed my faith. As a writer, I know the importance of showing, not just telling. So I scratched off some things that might distract us from the main “reason for the season.”</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Realization.</strong> This process helped me to begin planning for my holiday celebration and relieved a bit of my holiday stress. How?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Expectations.</strong> It helped me release my expectations of myself and of others. I won’t be avoiding certain family members who might not have the same values and beliefs.</li>
<li><strong>Stress.</strong> It enabled me to avoid unneeded expenses and the exhaustion of time-wasting commitments.</li>
<li><strong>Focus.</strong> I refocused on what matters most and the “real” meaning of the holiday and not on the frustrating and unnecessary aspects of the season.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern.</strong> It established a new pattern for approaching my life and work. Instead of thinking that I have to do everything that might be expected of me, I can choose a different response.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Questions.</strong> Now, I ask myself three questions before accepting any new challenge.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Passion.</strong> Am I really passionate about this?</li>
<li><strong>Practical.</strong> Do I have the skills, talent, or knowledge to do this? If not, do I have the time or resources to pursue it?</li>
<li><strong>Purpose.</strong> Does it meet an important need?</li>
</ol>
<p>If not, I’m saying, <strong>“NO!” </strong></p>
<p><strong>Celebration.</strong> I’m granting myself permission to let go, enjoy life, and celebrate. And I believe this holiday season and the upcoming year will be the best ever.</p>
<p><strong>How do you determine what matters most to you and your family?</strong></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wordservewatercooler.wordpress.com/15449/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wordservewatercooler.wordpress.com/15449/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wordservewatercooler.com&#038;blog=25062307&#038;post=15449&#038;subd=wordservewatercooler&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="width: 280px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="http://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2014/02/17/19/26/match-268528__180.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="180" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Light a Fire with Your Marketing Plan</p></div>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t there. I looked,&#8221; I told my mother so many times I lost count.</p>
<p>I also lost count of how many times she looked in the same place I did and said to me, with frustration in her voice, &#8220;Shelley, it&#8217;s right here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ugh. I hated when that happened. I felt stupid, embarrassed, and defective.</p>
<p>Why could SHE see it, but I couldn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>It took a few years, but finally, by the time I was 10 or 11 years old, I learned to instead say, whenever I couldn&#8217;t find whatever she said to look for or retrieve for her, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see it.&#8221; I&#8217;m 40 years old now, and I still use those same words in that situation.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with marketing? I&#8217;m certainly no expert in this field, but I have learned this: just because folks don&#8217;t see our books, products, services, or goods, it doesn&#8217;t mean they aren&#8217;t there. It also doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t have value. It just means that sometimes people need help to see the good stuff right in front of them.</p>
<p>So, how do we do this in an already saturated market where everyone (and sometimes their pets!) are on social media, have a blog, and publish their work? (I kid you not about pets, either.)</p>
<p>I asked around, and want to share with you what other authors shared with me. I am confident these tips will help you (and me!) in the challenging world of marketing our writing in addition to creating the content we’re trying to market.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay attention to social media: Don’t discount the value of sharing some freebies with folks right where they are. Find out where your audience hangs out most on social media and focus the majority of your social media time and attention there. For example, my readers tend to be on Facebook more than Twitter, so while I am in both places, I don’t kill myself in the Twitterverse when more engagement happens on Facebook (and increasingly on Instagram and Pinterest).</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, as you engage in today’s world of technology, these words from Marketing guru Rob Eagar:</p>
<p>“In a fast-paced world where Facebook, Twitter, and the 24/7 news media allow everyone to have a voice, it’s more important than ever to cut through all the noise. Use power-bites to punch through the cacophony, gain people’s attention, and spread your message like wildfire.” &#8211; See more good stuff from Rob <a href="http://www.startawildfire.com/2012/04/promote-your-book-or-message-with-power.html?utm_source=Monday+Morning+Marketing+Tip+-+Dec.+24%2C+2012&amp;utm_campaign=MMMT+Dec+24+2012&amp;utm_medium=email#sthash.Sp3h8n9z.dpuf">here</a>!</p>
<p>And this, from marketing expert Lori Twichell:</p>
<p>“The key to good marketing is making a connection with your audience. It&#8217;s got to be genuine. People can see through selfish motives. If you are only there to promote your book or product, people can sense that.&#8221; The more you get to know your audience and really make that honest contact, the more you&#8217;ll end up with a loyal audience that will follow not just this book, but future endeavors as well. That&#8217;s a key part of social media that is lacking in so many. We all love making new friends and connections, but no one wants to be spammed!</p>
<ul>
<li>Newsletters: Emailing your subscribers is the best way to get content in front of your readers on a consistent basis. When they subscribe or give you their contact info, they’ve invited you to connect with them. Make sure to add value to your subscribers’ lives, inviting them to open, read, and engage—be aware of what can feel “spammy” to your subscribers. In other words, don’t just send emails to send emails. And make sure you give more than you request.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s another tip from Lori Twichell: “Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are the best days to send newsletters. On Fridays people are eager to go home and clean out their inbox more quickly and on Mondays, they&#8217;re buried in the weekend&#8217;s email pile up.” (Connect with Lori for more good stuff at <a href="http://www.beyondthebuzzmarketing.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.beyondthebuzzmarketing.com</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Giveaways: Take advantage of what God has made available to you. What message has He entrusted to you to share with others? Offer some freebies along the way that build your credibility as one to listen and learn from in this over-saturated market.</li>
</ul>
<p>As writers, we long to have readers find value in what we have to say, right? It can be so difficult to balance the discipline of learning and expressing with the necessity to also market what we write. Ultimately God is our greatest promoter. If we can remember that our social media numbers, our book sales, and our greatest accomplishments do not come close to God’s power to promote us in due season, we&#8217;ll remain at peace and loving life on the way to where we’re going.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last several years, I&#8217;ve worked an assignment that has stretched me as a writer as much as anything has in a long, long time.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordservewatercooler.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/writing.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-15490" src="https://wordservewatercooler.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/writing.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="Writing" width="300" height="199" /></a>I&#8217;ve never sat down with the intentions of putting a fictional story to paper, but some of the sports I&#8217;ve covered for NCAA.COM are just about as close as I will ever get. NASCAR, I know. I worked that circus full time for nearly ten years. I&#8217;ve loved baseball since I was a child. I played football in high school.</p>
<p>Technically, I didn&#8217;t exactly play high-school football. I was on the team. I had a uniform and everything, but to actually play, you have to see time on the field. I was such a stellar athlete, I rode the bench for a team that went 0-10.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>I still loved football, and knew it well. But men&#8217;s gymnastics? Lacrosse? Track and field? Swimming and diving? My very first exposures to those sports were the days I sat down in the press box &#8230; or tent &#8230; or grandstands &#8230; to work their national championships.</p>
<p>I had a decision to make, and I had to make it quickly. I could treat these sports as some sort of quirky and obscure sideshow attractions, or I could handle them the way I eventually did. These coaches and student-athletes were absolutely as passionate about their respective endeavors as any involved in more well-known sports like football, basketball, and baseball.</p>
<p>How could I treat them with anything less than the utmost respect? I had to learn, and I had to do so fast. Admitting ignorance can be a wonderful thing sometimes, as I learned from the NCAA committee member who patiently explained the difference between a game, set, and match in tennis. I understood completely, I think.</p>
<p>As a result, I&#8217;ve come away with some of the most memorable stories of my career. There was Mo Imel, the women&#8217;s lacrosse star who gave up a Division I scholarship to move to a Division II school closer to her cancer-stricken sister. After her sister passed away, Mo and her parents attended the funeral in Maryland and then made the spur-of-the-moment decision to drive overnight to Mo&#8217;s lacrosse match the next afternoon in Florida.</p>
<p>Mo scored two goals that day, including the game winner.</p>
<p>So, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tip Number One</span> is to broaden your horizons as a writer. What&#8217;s that one subject you&#8217;ve always considered writing about, but haven&#8217;t gotten around to actually sitting down and tackling just yet? Go for it, and you might be surprised at how it turns out.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the sheer volume of copy I&#8217;ve been called upon to file for NCAA.COM. My personal record for churning out stories &#8212; and I&#8217;m talking career-wise, not just for NCAA.COM &#8212; is thirty-seven 800-word stories in sixteen days. Producing such a massive amount of work in that short a timeframe was one of my toughest challenges in nearly a quarter of a century as a full-time writer.</p>
<p>Again, I had a decision to make. When filing that much copy, it would have been easy to &#8220;phone it in&#8221; on a story or two. In other words, I could&#8217;ve simply slapped a bunch of words up on my laptop screen and sent them in without really caring about the result.</p>
<p>Aside from the theological implications of not making the best use of your God-given abilities, there are a few problems with this approach. Turn in too many &#8220;clunker&#8221; stories, and the assignment may go to somebody else the next time around. And for a freelancer like me, that&#8217;s a bad thing. A very, very bad thing.</p>
<p>Also, that story might very well be the only one ever written about a given coach or student-athlete. It&#8217;ll probably be posted on their Facebook page, or maybe even printed out and placed in a scrapbook or on the family refrigerator. If it&#8217;s under your byline, you want it to be the best story it can be, regardless of how many came before or after it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tip Number Two</span> is to give yourself plenty of time when writing, if at all possible. If your deadline is tight, don&#8217;t just pound the story out and file it. Do your best work, always.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I&#8217;m actually headed to Louisville, Kentucky this week to cover an NCAA Division II championship sports festival. Six different sports in three days, and filing what I&#8217;m assuming will be multiple stories for each. Say a prayer for me!</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wordservewatercooler.wordpress.com/15482/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wordservewatercooler.wordpress.com/15482/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wordservewatercooler.com&#038;blog=25062307&#038;post=15482&#038;subd=wordservewatercooler&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://wordservewatercooler.com/2014/11/11/the-writing-life/ ‎" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-15370" title="The Writing Life Developing a Thicker Skin via @JanalynVoigt | Wordserve Water Cooler" src="https://wordservewatercooler.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/the-writing-life-developing-a-thicker-skin.png?w=300&#038;h=395" alt="The Writing Life Developing a Thicker Skin via @JanalynVoigt | Wordserve Water Cooler" width="300" height="395" /></a>After I sold my first short story, every time I tried to write, I’d wind up staring at the blank screen until I gave up, often bursting into tears. This went on for a year, by which time I must have figured out no one was going to chain me to my desk and expect me to write on demand. I breathed easier and managed to write again, or at least I did until it occurred to me that my book project could fail. Sad but true, I had to get over both fear of success and fear of failure.</p>
<p>Both problems stemmed from the same stubborn root, caring too much what other people thought of my writing (and of me, by extension).</p>
<p>Being so shy didn&#8217;t help at all. I tried to hide the fact that I was a writer. Even close friends didn’t know until my husband started carrying magazines that contained my articles around so he could brag about his wife at a moment’s notice. He took my pleas that he stop for false modesty when they were in fact an attempt to protect myself from <em>The Look</em>. If you’ve been writing any length of time, you will know the one I mean. Eyebrows go up, eyes widen, and you begin to feel like a specimen in a laboratory.</p>
<p>I get <em>The Look</em> less often now that the e-book revolution has writers popping out of the proverbial woodwork, and when it happens my response has improved. My face doesn’t heat to blazing anymore, and I don’t yearn for escape.</p>
<p>What changed for me? I learned that having a thin skin isn’t something a writer can afford. Drawing your self esteem from the opinions of others at best makes you vulnerable and at worst misinforms you. Submit your writing to a critique group, and you’ll learn pretty quickly that while many opinions have value, not all are golden.</p>
<p>If you think taking a critique is hard, just wait until you go through edits. If you’re not familiar with the term, it’s when an editor or editors at your publisher house requests changes be made to your manuscript by you. It’s usually when you will question how you ever thought you could write. If you haven’t developed a thicker skin by this point in your writing career, trust me, you will. Having a sense of humor is an asset at such a time. I can’t say that edits for <strong><a title="DawnSinger" href="http://janalynvoigt.com/fantasy-books/tales-of-faeraven/dawnsinger/" target="_blank"><em>DawnSinger</em></a></strong>, my debut novel and book one in my <em>Tales of Faeraven</em> epic fantasy trilogy, were informed by mine. However, by the time edits arrived for <strong><a title="Wayfarer" href="http://janalynvoigt.com/fantasy-books/tales-of-faeraven/wayfarer/" target="_blank"><em>Wayfarer</em></a></strong>, book two in the series, humor was in full force. You just can’t take yourself too seriously.</p>
<p>That’s a good thing, because the very next thing you face after publication is book reviews. Some writers refrain from reading reviews of their books. I admire such will power but I don’t possess it. I’ve read every review of my books that comes to my attention. I like to learn from them, even negative ones. Happily, I’ve learned to place my self-worth in the hands of the Author of my faith.</p>
<p>How do you handle critique/criticism of your writing?</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wordservewatercooler.wordpress.com/15369/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wordservewatercooler.wordpress.com/15369/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wordservewatercooler.com&#038;blog=25062307&#038;post=15369&#038;subd=wordservewatercooler&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
