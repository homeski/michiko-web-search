<p class="p1">Every year or so, I re-read Stephen King’s <i>The Stand</i> and <i>Bag of Bones. </i>King may not be master wordsmith or inspiration by your reckoning, but he is by mine. I love those books.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I don’t read these novels for enjoyment anymore, however; I read them to study King’s storytelling. King’s earthy writing style, memorable characters and pacing deeply resonate with me. Whenever I revisit those books, I’m reminded of why I love them so … and I read them closely, so I can shamelessly crib the best crafty bits from them for my own work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I revisit the movie <i>The Matrix</i> for similar reasons. That is a movie with a concept so inventive and brainbending, and so masterfully executed, that I wish I could forget ever seeing it so I could see it again for the first time. I do my best to look past the style and spectacle and study its language—not just its well-crafted screenplay, but its imagery (which complements the narrative through visual symbolism, shorthand, etc.). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When time permits, I’ll dive back into TV shows such as <em>Gilmore Girls, Babylon 5</em>—even cheesy fare like <em>Knight Rider</em>—to pluck storytelling best practices that I can use in my fiction. Even our guilty pleasures have lessons to teach us … </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">even if it&#8217;s only what <i>not </i>to do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I come from these visitations refreshed and inspired, with new insights (and sometimes jaw-dropping revelations) about these seemingly-familiar tales. For instance, the way King peels back the onion-layers of a character, while shoving that person further into the terrible Unknown. The remarkable narrative sleight of hand the Wachowskis use to deliver unexpected plot twists … and then elegantly and economically present new characters, worlds and conflicts. The verve of Amy Sherman-Palladino’s dialogue in <em>Gilmore Girls</em>, and how it always feels crisp and playful, like biting into a granny smith apple.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And I draw endless inspiration from the talking car in <em>Knight Rider</em> because talking cars are rad.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As 2014 draws to a close, now’s a good time to consider your own favorite “study” media—the stories that you return to again and again for creative inspiration, or insights into the craft. Revisiting some of those tales might rejuvenate you for all that writing you’ll be doing next year.</span><span id="more-33338"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">So, what are some of your favorite stories to revisit, to study? </span><span class="s1">Let’s generate a thriving list in the comments for everyone to benefit from.</span><span class="s1"> Tell us what books, films, plays, etc. you study, and be sure to tell us </span><span class="s2">why</span><span class="s1">!</span></strong></p>

<p>I feel lucky. I love being a writer and part of why I do is because it allows me to work alone, be alone. It’s not exactly that I don’t like being around other people (I do, kind of). But when I worked in corporate America, I couldn’t get away from people, couldn’t find time for myself. Maybe because I’m an introvert I love spending time alone. I am actually happiest alone and in my head.</p>
<p>But the flip side? Alone can lead to lonely.</p>
<p>It used to be that I’d get my “human fix” by having coffee with a friend once a month. That was when my kids were home and there was the predictability and clamor of the day. Once the kids were at school, I’d come home and walk the dog, then I’d write. I had several business clients who kept me busy. At the other end of the day, the kids would come home and life was a whirl.</p>
<p>Things changed. I live in an empty nest now—my two kids successfully (and happily) launched. There have been other life changes as well. More stressors. My husband was unemployed for a while—which was nice because he was home so I had company, but worrisome in many other ways. When he started working again he was gone all the time. Then one of my closest friendships ended abruptly. I stopped freelance writing to focus on fiction.</p>
<p>Then our dog died. And my world kind of bottomed out. My daily companion, <a href="http://juliamunroemartin.com/2014/11/pushing-through/">my beloved soul-dog was gone</a>.</p>
<p>And for the first time, I really felt like the lonely writer.</p>
<p>By the time I realized I was in trouble, I would often find myself at tear’s edge. I started writing in a local coffee shop many mornings, found solace (if not conversation) in “the regulars.” But it wasn’t enough. I started craving human conversation. I’m usually a very independent, self-sufficient, bounce-back kind of person, but I didn’t feel very resilient anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Signs you might be lonely</strong></p>
<p>In case you wonder what loneliness looks like, this is what it looked like for me.</p>
<p>You know that overly-chatty mailman you usually run into your house to get away from? You invite him into your mudroom when he delivers a certified letter—then you chat for five minutes. You’re sorry <span id="more-34706"></span>to see him go. When you hire a carpenter to do some work around your house, he tells you, “We need to limit our conversations to two minutes a day.” (No I didn’t make this up.) You have gone through your friend list—twice—and wonder why it’s taken half a day (okay ten minutes) for people to respond to coffee invitations. You look forward to grand re-openings of the grocery store, of the library, of the new bridge to town. You spend more and more time on social networking (which of course raises its own set of issues). Your characters become your best friends, and you talk to other people about them as though they are real. You stop random people on the beach to tell them how much their dog reminds you of yours that died the month before (except they have a Shizh Tzu and you had a black Lab)…</p>
<p><div class="simplePullQuote"><p>By the time I realized I was in trouble, I would often find myself at tear’s edge. I started writing in a local coffee shop many mornings, found solace (if not conversation) in “the regulars.” But it wasn’t enough. I started craving human conversation. I’m usually a very independent, self-sufficient, bounce-back kind of person, but I didn’t feel very resilient anymore.</p>
</div>But the crowning glory came with this. You realize you have regular hours at the usual coffee shop when someone approaches you one morning and introduces himself. “Hi I’m Bob. I like to talk to the other regulars every morning…” I became a regular. The weird woman in the corner who everyone knows is a writer (the barista even knew about the story I was writing), with my stuff spread all over the table for several hours, the one pressed into conversations with Bob and the other regulars.</p>
<p><strong>What can we do?</strong></p>
<p>This is not something new. All writers go though it to some degree at some time or another. It&#8217;s a job requirement to be solitary after all. Porter Anderson wrote an interesting piece on Writer Unboxed last year in <a href="http://writerunboxed.com/2013/08/16/are-you-lonesome-tonight-the-dreaded-solitude-of-writing/">&#8220;Are You Lonesome Tonight? The Dreaded Solitude of Writing.&#8221;</a> It affects us in different ways. Everyone’s threshold is different. Maybe you need human companionship once a month, maybe you have six kids at home and are never lonely and escape to the bathroom whenever you can. Maybe you like to be alone all the time; maybe it’s okay with you to be the coffee shop regular.</p>
<p>But in all seriousness, loneliness can be a real problem, and I started to wonder—was I just lonely or was I depressed? I was especially worried with the long, dark Maine winter coming on. I knew I’d be even more isolated.</p>
<p>I made an appointment with a therapist (no, this was not just another excuse to talk to someone because I was lonely). She confirmed my belief. Although I wasn’t depressed, I was going through serious life changes. She could help. She does help.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas I’ve come up with&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a new interest, join a new organization</li>
<li>Join or start a writing group</li>
<li>Take some classes</li>
<li>Reach out to friends often (but you should give them more than ten minutes to answer), don’t isolate yourself, don’t wait until you feel desperate</li>
<li>Go to different coffee shops, meet new people</li>
<li>Go on outings, walk in new places, join a new gym</li>
<li>Leave your house at least once a day</li>
</ul>
<p>It still feels strange to have to seek out other things. When I have free, unstructured time (which is much more these days), I always think of writing first. My story is always in the back of my mind. If I could, I think I’d like to write twenty-four hours a day (yes I like it that much). I love writing and being a writer.</p>
<p>But now I also recognize that I need to do other things. Writing can’t consume my every <em>available</em> moment like it used to. Writing requires solitude, but what started out as barely being able to carve out enough alone time from the hubbub of life became an endless expanse of time. And, although I love being alone, I’ve also found that I don’t like too much aloneness. My goal is to find balance. To embrace my aloneness without being lonely. To find other new and exciting things to pursue.</p>
<p>It’s not easy, and I’m still a work in progress, but I’m figuring it out.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever felt like the lonely writer? Do you have any suggestions or ideas of how to combat it? </strong></p>

<p>Recently, as I was preparing for my Mortal Heart book tour, I found myself in a logistical flurry trying to pack ten days’ worth of clothes and personal items into one carry on. There was the big, obvious stuff;  four pairs of pants, eight shirts, ten pairs of socks, under duds, toiletries, iPad, reading material, pens, etc. However, there were also some rather unique items. Like the veritable cobbler’s bench worth of extra insoles, arch supports, moleskin and shoe enhancers that I might need for the two pairs of shoes I was taking—both brand new since my feet had suddenly grown half a size well past the time I expected my feet to do anymore growing. Or the old black t-shirt I’ve grown accustomed to draping over my eyes instead of an eye mask.</p>
<p>While those were admittedly odd, they weren’t nearly as discomfiting as the small medicine chest of ‘tools’ I was bringing along to ensure I could endure the strange, torture devices that the modern plane seat has evolved into; Advil, Aleve, arnica, muscle relaxants (in case things got really hairy) and maybe even a half a Xanax or two, in case it all got to be too much.</p>
<p>As I struggled to fit everything into that one piece of luggage, I was struck by the enormous load of invisible baggage I was carrying with me on this trip. My worries—about travel, my feet, whether or not anyone would show up at the events. My fears—of travel delays, wickedly uncomfortable plane seats, lost luggage, public speaking (mostly gone at this stage of my life but reappearing just often enough to keep me off balance.) My hopes—that I would meet reader expectations, book sales, and my own performance. And lastly, my conditioning, if you will—from my earliest, most damaging beliefs that I did not have a right to a voice, or was allowed to speak into the public conversation at large, to my more recent attempts to rewrite that programming—helped in large part by wildly enthusiastic and generous readers, booksellers, friends and family.</p>
<p>The thing is, my experience is not unique. Whenever any of us set out on a journey of any length, we not only have the physical supplies we carry with us, but an invisible backpack or suitcase packed full of our hopes and fears, expectations and programming.</p>
<p>These invisible backpacks are one of the most intimate, rich, unique and authentic things about us. They accompany us on a trip of ten days or a ten minute jaunt to the grocery store and everything in-between. Yes, even to work, and yes, even when we work in a home office.</p>
<p>As a writer, these invisible backpacks are one of our most powerful tools.</p>
<p>The thing is, if every story is about a character going on a journey, whether a physical or metaphorical one, then they, too, should have one of these invisible backpacks. If they don’t, the journey often feels flat and unimportant, uncompelling and lacking in urgency.</p>
<p>Unlike a regular suitcase, the weight of the invisible one is always there. It weighs down on even our most simple actions and decisions. It’s what turns a simple act—say reaching for a cup of coffee or opening a door or shutting a window—into a loaded, complex dramatic action.<span id="more-34685"></span></p>
<p>A while ago I talked about how it was the <a href="http://writerunboxed.com/2013/12/13/things-left-unspoken/">unseen things that defined the relationship</a>. This isn’t true only for relationships with other people, but our relationship with the <em>world</em> as well. The often unseen and unacknowledged things we carry in our invisible backpacks not only color our interactions with the world around us, but can often predict the outcome of a journey before we’ve even begun. That’s why two people can take the same exact physical journey and yet one will be transformed by the experience, see it as a world expanding and life affirming, while the other will return embittered and disillusioned, due in no small part to the content of those backpacks.</p>
<p>The topmost layers of the backpack is often just the emotional detritus of everyday life. A fight with the spouse, a sick child, trouble making the rent that month, a falling out with a best friend. Worry over the approaching storm. Concern if the traffic will make you late. Frustration that you can’t afford a new sword or that your horse has lost a shoe.</p>
<p>Below that is our acknowledged fears and hopes. Will we get the promotion. Will our boss like our presentation. Can we get to the next village before the bad guys do. Can we break into the villain’s fortress.</p>
<p>But below that, and more broad and influential, is the product of our conditioning or programming. Do we see the world as a hopeful, positive place? One where we can effect change and make our influence felt? Or is it a barren, hopeless place that is indifferent to our efforts and desires? Are we generally met with openness and good will or do we constantly face suspicion and mistrust?</p>
<p>A hopeful, confident person will greet a stranger on the road in a much different way than one who has been consistently defeated by life. The person who expects disaster at every turn and constantly scans her surroundings trying to anticipate that disaster makes decision and choices in a significantly different way than someone who has experienced mostly clear sailing.</p>
<p>A bonus added level complexity to be tapped is the whole way we work so hard to avoid acknowledging the content of our backpacks: using humor to deflect pain, doubling down on toughness to avoid that sick feeling of being afraid.</p>
<p>Often the contents of these invisible backpacks are at odds with each other. Our hopes in direct conflict with our fears or worries. Our social conditioning gives us no reason to dream—and yet in a triumph of the human spirit, we dream anyway.</p>
<p>If you’re not constantly rummaging through your character’s invisible backpack and stirring up the contents, then you are missing out on a mother lode of opportunity as a storyteller. It is full of rich stuff, emotional pay dirt that we have at our disposal to craft compelling stories. If you’re lost on where to start in defining your character’s invisible backpack, I invite you to spend a few minutes rummaging through your own first. As I so recently discovered for myself, it will be most enlightening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Can you identify what your protagonist’s invisible backpack might contain? And if so, how does it color their actions and decisions—both the very small, seemingly insignificant ones and the larger, set piece ones?</strong></em></p>

<p>Change is hard, even good change. Learning to navigate change is why we’re wired for story in the first place. Even when we’re caught up in what we might <em>think </em>of as mere entertainment, under our conscious radar the story is mainlining inside info on how to deal with the changes that we can’t avoid, put off, or pretend aren’t really there. And so since the only constant <em>is </em>change, there will always be new stories, because stories will always have something to teach us. That’s why storytellers are the most powerful people on the planet.</p>
<p>But that power doesn’t come easily. I’m not talking about the power that comes from the story, the writing, or what you can do to become a better writer (you know, the thing I’m always going on and on about). Today I’m talking about something else: having the power to change your life in order to have a shot at writing anything powerful at all. Most of us try to avoid, put off, or pretend we don’t need to make any changes in order to write a book – but we do.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote"><p>To become a writer, you have to give something up. Something time consuming. Something you care about, and that in all likelihood might have unsettling, ongoing ramifications once you let it go.</p>
</div>
<p>And of all the changes large and small, there’s one that underlies them all, and without it nothing else matters much. What change is that? The willingness to pay the ultimate price in the most precious commodity we have: time. Sounds obvious, doesn’t it? But as with most things, while the general concept is crystal clear, the specifics – what you need to actually do – is not. Because to become a writer, you have to give something up. Something time consuming. Something you care about, and that in all likelihood might have unsettling, ongoing ramifications once you let it go.</p>
<p>This is a lesson I learned from my writing coach, <a href="http://jennienash.com" target="_blank">Jennie Nash</a>. She told me early on that if you want to be a writer, you have to take a good hard look at your life, find something you spend a lot of time doing, and give it up in order to free the time to write.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t believe her at first. <span id="more-34651"></span>Like most people, I thought I could <em>find </em>the time to write.</p>
<p>But with crazy busy as the new norm, who ever finds time laying around unused? Especially since all that great “time saving” technology they’ve been gleefully producing at warp speed has morphed into the biggest time suck ever. Did you answer all your email today? Tweet? Post something on Instagram? Pinterest? Check in on Facebook? Catch up on the blogs you read? Leave meaningful comments? Respond to the comments on your comments? Feed the dog? What dog? Uh oh.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote"><p>Turns out mental energy is not something we can simply will ourselves to have. It’s biological.</p>
</div>
<p>Point is, modern life is overwhelming enough. It doesn’t just gobble up your time, it saps your energy in the process. Which, as it turns out, is way more finite than we knew. Turns out mental energy is not something we can simply will ourselves to have. It’s biological. As Stanford Neuroscience Professor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sapolsky" target="_blank">Robert Sapolsky </a>says, “It turns out that the power part of “willpower” is no mere figure of speech. The brain is as real a blood-and-guts biological entity as . . . your blood and guts. The largest lesson is that who we are and what we do must always be considered in the context of the biology occurring inside us.”</p>
<p>Trouble is, we live in a society that doesn’t believe that for an instant, and loves to tell us we can do anything if we just set our mind to it. Learning that this is not true – that we do have limited resources – is very hard.</p>
<p>It’s much easier to embrace the notion that being a writer is something you can slip into your life by rearranging your schedule, or getting less sleep, or grabbing ten minutes here or there. And there are books that will advise you to do just that. In fact, I just randomly typed, “write a novel in ten minutes a day” into google to see what would come up, and guess what &#8212; there <em>is</em> a book with that exact title. Will those daily ten minute snippets add up to anything over the long haul? Probably not. Will there <em>be</em> a long haul, will you really shoehorn out ten minutes a day forever? Again, probably not. Not because you’re weak willed or lazy, but because all those things you’re doing already <em>are</em> taking up all your time, and carefully structured schedules do not take kindly to being messed with.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote"><p>We live in a society that loves to tell us we can do anything if we just set our mind to it. Learning that this is not true – that we do have limited resources – is very hard.</p>
</div>
<p>That’s why you have to be bold. You have to take a good hard look at your life and see what can go, even though it hurts. And maybe, just maybe, the unease we feel letting something go is a good thing. Maybe the lingering fear that we’ve made a mistake isn’t regret. Maybe it’s the point. Maybe it’s saying: You’ve given me up in order to get something done, so you damn well better give it your all. At the end of the day, isn’t that what having skin in the game is all about?</p>
<p>That idea is summed up best in the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~commence/news/speeches/2014/rhimes-address.html" target="_blank">commencement speech</a> that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shonda_Rhimes" target="_blank">Shonda Rhimes</a> gave at Dartmouth last year. When in college, her dream was to be the next Toni Morrison. Instead she went on to create a TV empire that includes <em>Gray’s Anatomy</em> and<em> Scandal</em>. She’s incredibly successful. She has a great family, great kids, an amazing career. Doesn’t sound like she had to give up anything, does it? And yet . . .</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote"><p>You have to be bold. You have to take a good hard look at your life and see what can go, even though it hurts.</p>
</div>
<p>“People are constantly asking me, how do you do it all?</p>
<p>And I usually just smile and say like, &#8220;I&#8217;m really organized.&#8221; Or if I&#8217;m feeling slightly kindly, I say, &#8220;I have a lot of help.&#8221;</p>
<p>And those things are true. But they also are not true . . .</p>
<p>How do you do it all?</p>
<p>The answer is this: I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Whenever you see me somewhere succeeding in one area of my life, that almost certainly means I am failing in another . . . That is the   tradeoff. That is the Faustian bargain one makes with the devil . . . You never feel a hundred percent OK; you never get your sea legs; you are always a little nauseous. Something is always lost.</p>
<p>Something is always missing.</p>
<p>And yet . . .”</p>
<p>And yet we keep at it, don’t we? We keep going, we keep striving, we keep working to make a difference. Which means that along the way we’ve had to give up lots of other things &#8212; things that we really wanted to do &#8212; in order to keep our eyes on the prize.</p>
<p><strong>Which brings me to why I’m writing this post: I’m going to be taking a leave of absence from Writer Unboxed for the next four months, while I write my next book. Jennie made me. I’ll be back in May.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What about you? What have you given up in order to have the time to write? And how do you deal with those moments when it made you feel like you were failing in another area of your life?</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><div id="attachment_34637" style="width: 202px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://writerunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/3708975865_a70a73a1d8_m.jpg"><img class="wp-image-34637 size-full" src="http://writerunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/3708975865_a70a73a1d8_m.jpg" alt="3708975865_a70a73a1d8_m" width="192" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I make this same face when someone interrupts my writing or when I am not getting enough fiber in my diet.</p></div>
<p>A few weeks ago, a friend was talking about a Leonard Bernstein Omnibus lecture, the one in which Bernstein discusses the power and beauty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4IRMYuE1hI">Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony</a>. Three Gs and an E flat. <em>Bah Bah Bah BAAAH. Bah bah bah BAAAH</em>.</p>
<p>Bernstein sits down at a piano and plays those four notes, explaining that while they are the theme around which Beethoven builds the entire symphony, they alone do not make the piece so powerful. Rather, Bernstein says, the Fifth has universal appeal because each note feels inevitable based on the note that precedes it. Huh! Quite an accomplishment for a deaf fellow with huge hair and an even bigger scarf/collar situation.</p>
<p>And Bernstein is correct. Whether the score includes a C-sharp or a fermata over a dotted half note, we listeners sense there is nothing that could fit more perfectly or precisely. The result? A composition of notes so thoughtfully arranged that they create an ordered, satisfying, musical story.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s why we gravitate toward great art: at its most basic level, great art creates a story that is comprised of one inevitable, satisfying beat after another. When each note (or brushstroke or word) feels inevitable, it reminds us that even with the chaos in our world: courtroom verdicts, ISIS beheadings, suicide bombers, pediatric cancer, racism and poverty, we can rely on great music, art, poetry and fiction to deliver a story that points us to order, truth, peace and justice.</p>
<p>Story keeps us breathing. Story keeps us sane. Story also makes us smarter. Albert Einstein (supposedly) said, &#8220;If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales.&#8221; Similarly, in <em><a href="http://wiredforstory.com/">Wired for Story</a>, </em>Lisa Cron (who has the exact same IQ as Einstein), explains how story is the art form from which humans make sense of confusing, complex things. Story is art. Crafting story is also <em>an</em> art.</p>
<p>In our fiction then, how do we follow a deaf composer&#8217;s example? How do we build stories where each word, sentence, scene and plot point falls inevitably after the one that precedes it? <span id="more-34636"></span></p>
<p><strong>First, we must know where the story is going.</strong> However we craft our stories (with pants or without) we cannot replicate the Fifth’s feeling of order and inevitability if we don’t know our characters&#8217; destination. As captains of our ship-story, we need to assure the reader that we have both map and compass. Perhaps Dramamine and Chapstick. Maybe some beef jerky and juice boxes. But map and compass are crucial. Without them, we writers cannot weave a collection of beats, scenes and chapters into a conclusion that feels right and inevitable.</p>
<p>But hold on! A &#8220;right and inevitable&#8221; conclusion may not always be fair and just. Meaning, the good guy will not always win. It will <em>feel</em> fair and just, however, based on how the writer has teed up each scene. The climax and conclusion of <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, for example, may not feel fair because reckless, naughty, rich people run roughshod over innocent others. But based on the way Fitzgerald reveals the story, starting on page one, the ending with the beautiful passage, <em>So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past</em>, the conclusion feels true. Gatsby and his gilded dreams could never have survived in Daisy&#8217;s and Tom&#8217;s world. Wealthy people have power. They escape scrutiny. Any other outcome would have felt like cotton candy, coloring our tongues blue and leaving us with sticky fingers and unsatisfied hunger.</p>
<p><strong>We must also figure out how tension and conflict propel a story.</strong>  What does the character want? Who and what stand in his way? How will he overcome the obstacles? What will happen to him as a result of getting (or not getting) what he desires? I suggest you turn to <a href="http://maassagency.com/books-on-writing/">Donald Maass&#8217; craft books</a> for a far-better-than-I-could-do explanation of how a writer creates tension and conflict. It&#8217;s <em>muy importante, amigo</em>. And Mr. Maass is a generous expert.</p>
<p><strong>Then, get out of the story&#8217;s way.</strong> A story is a magical and fierce, living and breathing, arrangement of words. It knows where it needs to go, and we need to trust its power. A curly-haired woman would never straighten her hair on an August day with 96% humidity. She knows it&#8217;s silly to fight nature. It&#8217;s equally silly to fight story. Let a story lead us on the dance floor, and it will conclude with that satisfying feeling of inevitability.</p>
<p>Make no mistake! Inevitability is not synonymous with predictability. We do not want predictable stories. Surprises in fiction&#8211;delivered via plot, dialogue, diction or sentence structure&#8211;provide delightful moments. And we don&#8217;t have to worry; striving to create a feeling of inevitability in our stories will <em>not</em> render them formulaic and prescribed.</p>
<p>I recently finished reading Anthony Marra&#8217;s <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5989255.Anthony_Marra"><em>A Constellation of Vital Phenomena</em></a> and just finished viewing the BBC/Sundance miniseries, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2103085/"><em>Top of the Lake</em></a>. Both contain delightful and disturbing surprises as they move to their inevitable conclusions. Sure I would have loved a happi<em>er</em> ending in each, but my version of a happy ending would not have been true. While we may not realize it, we do seek truth in fiction.</p>
<p>But man, it is not easy to create a story that contains surprise <em>and </em>inevitability! Beethoven created fourteen discrete drafts of the Fifth over eight years. We too must revise. But how do we revise with the goal of inevitability? I don&#8217;t know exactly. There&#8217;s no recipe. I wish there were.</p>
<p>I do know it is possible. I know it requires incredible dedication and tenacity. It requires the time and desire to study others&#8217; fiction and craft books that illustrate the building blocks of scene. I know we need at least one fantastic writing partner, that we need to loosen the reigns and trust the thrum of the story. Oh, and a good gut feeling is incredibly helpful. But that&#8217;s all the advice I&#8217;ve got.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry. Truly.</p>
<p>I wish there were a recipe for Inevitability &amp; Surprise that I could share here. I do have an amazing chocolate cake recipe that won my neighborhood Chocolate Cake Cook-off . . . I can send you that if you like.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe you can help by contributing YOUR ideas? What strategies do you employ to create a sense of inevitability and truth in the flow of your story? Will you share some examples of film or fiction that illustrate the feeling of inevitability? Do you know <a href="http://beethovenswig.com/">this song</a>? </strong></p>
