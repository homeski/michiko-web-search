				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From author Rowena Macdonald via Glimmertrain:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many writers say they find writing dialogue difficult, which I always find surprising, as, without wishing to sound self-aggrandizing, dialogue is the one aspect of writing I find easy. To me, it isn&#8217;t that impressive to find dialogue easy. After all, we are primarily verbal creatures, we are surrounded by conversation every day, and most of us spend more time watching films and TV than we do reading books. I am always far more impressed by writers who are able to craft complicated plots, for example, since this is an aspect of writing I find difficult. To my mind, plotting is a superior skill because it isn&#8217;t something that occurs in reality: events don&#8217;t pan out in a neat, compelling sequence, loose ends are not neatly tied up and much of life is mundane, unsymbolic and random.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>1. Read it aloud. If it doesn&#8217;t sound natural, it isn&#8217;t. Make sure it sounds different from prose. Remember, few people talk in complete sentences.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>4. Don&#8217;t write out &#8220;ums&#8221; and &#8220;ers.&#8221; They are realistic, but they look cartoonish in a piece of literature. Instead, use ellipses to give the impression of pauses or uncertainty. Ellipses can also be used at the start and end of dialogue, when someone has been talking for a while and is likely to go on awhile, to give the impression of the other characters tuning out.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>6. If writing dialogue for a character with a specific accent, don&#8217;t write it out phonetically, as this can look patronizing and old-fashioned. Use odd syntax and a few choice bits of slang to convey their accent.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From BookRiot:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was always drawn to the tomboys in fiction, girls with cropped hair, grass-stained pants, and short tempers. The early books I fed myself on were Louisa May Alcott’s <em>Little Women</em> and <em>Nancy Drew</em>. Later I idolized Turtle Wexler, the shin-kicking, stock-obsessed 13 year-old in Ellen Raskin’s <em>The Westing Game</em>, and Harper Lee’s Scout Finch and Carson McCullers’ Mick Kelly, the young protagonist of <em>The Heart is a Lonely Hunter</em>. While reading some of these books to my daughter, I was immediately struck by the gravitational pull these characters had on me as a child, and the way they influenced me as both a woman and a writer.</p>
<p><em>Little Women</em> came first, as a gorgeous volume underneath the Christmas tree. I knew it was special, the kind of book you held onto for the rest of your life, and I secreted it away, stashing it in a wooden cabinet close to my bed. I read and re-read it, focusing on the sections about Jo and her precious notebooks full of writing, and the moment when she boldly decides to cut off her hair. The reader can’t help but be drawn to Jo; she’s a woman of action, ideals, and endearing flaws. I could <em>feel </em>her potential as a human being—if only the world would get out of her way.</p>
<p>Jo March, during a particularly grumpy monologue, cries, “<em>It’s bad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boys’ games and work and manners! I can’t get over my disappointment in not being a boy; and it’s worse than ever now, for I’m dying to go and fight with papa, and I can only stay at home and knit, like a poky old woman!” </em> To be fair, I don’t aspire to fight, and I love knitting and other traditionally feminine, poky pursuits: cooking, gardening, antiquing. I don’t so much want to be a boy as I want to be free from expectations about traditional femininity and the messages society throws my way: clean your house, tend your children while your husband pursues his dreams, be gentle and beautiful, don’t age. I don’t think Jo resents <em>being</em> a girl as much as being <em>treated </em>like one; she resents her lack of agency, the sense of helplessness that permeates her work and home life.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>To me, the “tomboy” has enviable mobility, the option of moving between gendered activities, and the permission to be honest about her wants and desires. Jo wants to write and earn money, but still likes a good party and gossiping with her sisters. Nancy Drew and her best friend George go dancing with their boyfriends, but they also take physical risks, chasing “prowlers” down dark streets and inside haunted mansions, scaling fences, sailing boats, taking Nancy’s blue convertible on a high-speed chase. (Okay, maybe a medium-speed chase.) There is, I believe, evidence of the animus in tomboyish characters in fiction, the unconscious masculine personality asserting itself. I sensed this early on, and admired it, later recognizing a desire to honor it in my characters and in myself.</p>
<p>It’s hard to talk about tomboys without bringing up the contemporary issue of female protagonists and likeability, a conversation I usually find reductive. I’m not a reader who needs to “like” a protagonist—what I’m more drawn to as an adult reader is complexity, awareness, and emotional honesty, energy on the page. When I look back to how my earliest sensibilities as a reader were constructed, I inevitably think of the tomboys I loved. I train my eye on the complex, dream-pursuing woman, not the chit.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Publshing Perspectives:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reykjavík may have just 230,000 people, but on a night in November there were no less than a half-dozen book launches taking place on the same night. Both the mayor of the city and the President of Iceland showed up.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Iceland is said to produce the most books per capita anywhere in the world. The average print run here is 2,000 copies for a commercial title, with as much as 60-70% of all books being sold during the Christmas season. Publishers produce a holiday book catalog that goes to every home in the country and giving books for the holidays is a tradition that dates back to the period of austerity following World War II when imports were severely limited. Books were one gift that you could give that wouldn’t break the bank.</p>

<p>“What can I say,” said one friend, “we’re Icelandic, we were raised on the Sagas, we like stuff to happen in our books…action.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Your peer group has associate members.</p>

<p>You hide candy in absurd places in your bedroom, but you do not have an ant problem.</p>

<p>You and your friends run a weird, complicated, under-the-table small business, but only one of you is “bossy.”</p>

<p>You take great pleasure in listing every article of clothing you’re wearing, as well as every article of clothing each of your six closest friends are wearing.</p>
<p>Your shyest friend has a dreamy boyfriend with a southern accent. Nobody understands why, including said boyfriend.</p>
<p>You have been in literally every extracurricular activity your school has to offer, but never for longer than two weeks.</p>
<p>You find yourself oddly attracted to the supernatural and situations that could be described as mysterious. On some more memorable locations, you’ve even helped the police solve seemingly inexplicable crimes. And you’re not even in high school yet.</p>
<p>You frequently embark on cross-country and even transatlantic trips that are sponsored by your school. Your <em>middle</em> school.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Flavorwire:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s been a lot of talk about genre in the air recently (well, really, when isn’t there?) — what it means, whether it’s changed, whether it’s even useful or important anymore. But no matter what is said, there’s still that lingering stigma that keeps worthy works of genre (for clarity, we’re mostly talking fantasy and science fiction, with a little historical fiction, mystery and crime thrown in for good measure) from ascending to full classic status: being taught in high schools, appearing on all-time best-book lists, etc. Some genre novels have already crossed the border into pure classic territory — <em>Brave New World</em>, <em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em>and <em>1984</em> are all genre and established classics by any measuring stick,<em>The Lord of the Rings</em> is so ubiquitous and grand that it’s forced itself into the canon, and let’s not forget that <em>Wuthering Heights</em> is a ghost story, and so, of course, is <em>Beloved</em>. To add to that list, here are 25 genre novels that should be considered classics.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J4WLU0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004J4WLU0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepasvoi01-20&amp;linkId=I62IXWN45UCAEXHU"  target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Embassytown</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=thepasvoi01-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004J4WLU0" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></em>, China Miéville</strong></p>
<p>One of the leaders of the Weird Fiction movement, you can always count on Miéville for some strange brilliance. This novel, which won the 2012 Locus Award for best Science Fiction novel of the year, is concerned, among other things with language itself: the main character, who returns home after many years, is a living simile in a tongue she no longer speaks. Not surprising, since it takes two mouths. In any event, things soon begin to unravel, as things often do, and the result is a gem of a novel in any language.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ECB2934/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00ECB2934&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepasvoi01-20&amp;linkId=KP73TQFFLK5XXRK7"  target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Island of Doctor Moreau</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=thepasvoi01-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00ECB2934" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></em>, H.G. Wells</strong></p>
<p>Wells is probably best known for <em>The Time Machine</em> and <em>The War of the Worlds</em> — classics in their own right. But to my mind, this bizarre book is his greatest achievement, dubbed by Borges an “atrocious miracle,” and impossible to scrub from one’s mind.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AB194RS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00AB194RS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepasvoi01-20&amp;linkId=VCU34VWGHW66FKFC"  target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Daughter of Time</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=thepasvoi01-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00AB194RS" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></em>, Josephine Tey</strong></p>
<p>Tey’s 1951 novel is widely praised as one of the best crime novels of all time, but has never really crossed over into genre-blind classic. A shame, because it incorporates history, mystery, crime, and the way we construct the truth into a brilliant, important work.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CQY9CPM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00CQY9CPM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepasvoi01-20&amp;linkId=TVJKF6MTDX6HAH4G"  target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Duplex</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=thepasvoi01-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00CQY9CPM" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></em>, Kathryn Davis</strong></p>
<p>Davis’s slim novel is a mega-bonkers fantasy that uncorks what it’s like to be a young girl, and what it’s like to grow up from that girlhood, at the same time as it investigates robots and sorcerers without souls. How does she do it? She must be a sorceress herself. An ensouled one, of course. Maybe doubly so.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From author Ashley R. Carlson via Self-Publishing Review:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Six months ago I quit my job to write a book.</strong></p>
<p>Because I was blessed financially, I decided that if I were to get some roommates I could feasibly leave the job I hated and pursue my real dream—to write a novel.</p>
<p>And I did. My debut novel, a steampunk fantasy called “The Charismatics,” released on December 13<sup>th</sup> on Amazon and my website.</p>
<p>How was I able to produce something in such a timely fashion? Well, I want to share my experiences and timeline with you.</p>
<p><b>Firstly—the main reason</b> I was able to publish a book in six months is because I wasn’t working a 9-to-5. I wasn’t exhausted all the time, and it allowed me to really unleash my creativity when I was mentally, physically and emotionally strong.</p>
<p>I know that quitting a position isn’t feasible for 99% of you—but what I want to impart here is that in order to complete your book in a timely fashion, you need to be diligent about setting aside TIME, SPACE and QUIET to allow yourself to write.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>So even though I wasn’t working at a job anymore, I actually had <i>more </i>work to do than ever before—I kissed parties and movies and dating goodbye. Truly, I did. But because I holed up inside my office, living and breathing my book nearly every waking moment, it allowed me to complete it much more quickly than my previous attempts at writing (I have numerous half-finished manuscripts floating around on my computers from years past).</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p><strong>Mid-November 2014-late November 2014:</strong> Wrote the fifth draft, taking into account editor’s comments. Sent my finalized draft to formatter to be designed in various book formats. Found numerous typos and changes desired so I wrote the sixth draft in late November. Received formatted print book late November and ordered copies from CreateSpace.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p><strong>December 12<sup>th</sup>, 2014:</strong> Goodreads print book giveaway closed, 843 total entries and three winners. Preparation for book launch party on December 13<sup>th</sup>, 2014 at family home. Schedule updates on Twitter and Facebook through Hootsuite to advertise the release date. Write and schedule newsletter through MailChimp to go out to newsletter subscribers on December 13<sup>th</sup> at midnight encouraging them to purchase a book on release date and increase Amazon ranking. Also encourage readers to use the hashtag <strong>#TheCharismatics</strong> to increase awareness and interaction about the book release.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Vanity Fair:</p>
<blockquote><p>The planet’s best-selling author since 2001, James Patterson has more than 300 million copies of his books in print, an army of co-writers, several TV deals in the works, and an estimated income of $90 million last year alone. But where’s the respect?</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>With 305 million copies of his books in print worldwide, Patterson is the great white shark of novelists, a relentless writing machine who has to keep swimming forward in order to feed, and who, together with his army of about two dozen credited co-writers, has been the planet’s best-selling author since 2001 (ahead of J. K. Rowling, Nora Roberts, Dr. Seuss, and John Grisham). Of all the hardcover fiction sold in the U.S. in 2013, books by Patterson accounted for one out of every 26. Altogether, he has produced more than 130 separate works—the “books by” page in his latest novels actually takes up three full pages. <i>Forbes</i> estimates his income for the year ending last June at $90 million. When I had a chance to ask Patterson about that figure, he at first said, “I don’t know,” and then followed up with “Yeah, probably.”</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>His first novel, <i>The Thomas Berryman Number,</i> about a Nashville newspaperman on a murderer’s trail, was rejected by 31 publishers before Little, Brown published it, in 1976. It won the Edgar Award for best first novel from the Mystery Writers of America, but sold only about 10,000 copies. Since then—and especially since 1996, when he quit advertising to write full-time—Patterson has proved that his readers have insatiable appetites. He has produced a slew of books—detective series, stand-alone romances, illustrated novels for young adults and for middle-school readers—across a sea of genres, accounting, by his own estimate, for about 30 percent of Little, Brown’s total revenues. He is intimately involved in designing his books and devising their marketing and advertising campaigns, with the help of a special in-house unit of half a dozen staffers at Little, Brown dedicated solely to serving the Patterson empire.</p>
<p>“I’m sure there’s no publishing relationship like it,” Michael Pietsch—Patterson’s former editor who is now C.E.O. of Hachette Book Group (Little, Brown’s parent company)—told me recently. “Jim is the smartest person I’ve ever worked with, across a vast landscape of things you can be brilliant about—suspense, emotions, and readers’ expectations and how to work them.” Pietsch said Patterson had built “a kind of studio system in which he can imagine these stories into being, then work with co-authors so that these stories come into the world.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Patterson is to publishing what Thomas Kinkade was to painting, or the television producer John Wells was to a series like <i>E.R.</i> He is not a tortured artist in a garret but rather presides over an atelier that produces mass popular entertainment on an astonishing scale. He once said of his work, in a profile a decade ago, “I look at it the way Henry Ford would look at it.”</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The conventional view of mysteries…is as an essentially conservative genre. A crime disturbs the status quo; we readers get to enjoy the transgressive thrill, then observe approvingly as the detective, agent of social order, sets things right at the end. We finish our coca and tuck ourselves in, safe and sound….But what this theory fails to take into account is the next book, the next murder, and the next. When you line up all the Poirots, all the Maigrets, all the Lew Archers and Matt Scudders, what you get is something far stranger and more familiar: a world where mysterious destructive forces are constantly erupting and where all solutions are temporary, slight pauses during which we take a breath before the next case.</p>
