				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-15094" src="http://3uqu7a1gh6z23dcksz1rpmth.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/24387744_s-150x150.jpg" alt="Man freaking out" width="150" height="150" />&#8220;The report of my death was an exaggeration.&#8221; So said Mark Twain in 1897, and I&#8217;m wondering if Barnes &amp; Noble might be saying the same thing right about now.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Over the last week, an article by Michael Levin has been making the rounds, causing fear and trembling among certain groups of authors and publishing folks.  Syndicated on news websites all over the U.S., Levin&#8217;s article predicts that Barnes &amp; Noble may close all the rest of their stores by the end of the year. It proposes five reasons for B&amp;N&#8217;s demise, and goes on to lament the awful tragedy this would be. (You can read a version of the article <a title="Will Barnes &amp; Noble Be Gone By New Year's" href="http://www.contracostatimes.com/opinion/ci_25685095/guest-commentary-will-barnes-noble-be-gone-by" target="_blank">HERE</a>.)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I just want to add my two cents to the pot:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3><em>Everybody, get a grip.</em></h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
1. We&#8217;ve known for a long time that B&amp;N&#8217;s position was—and is—precarious. This is not news. (Forecasting &#8220;B&amp;N closing by the end of the year&#8221; is, however, a great way to get lots of clicks and shares.)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. While it could happen, we haven&#8217;t seen any evidence that B&amp;N will be dead before 2015. This business is always rampant with rumors, and what good does it do? I prefer to ignore attention-seeking prognostications and wait for the real news.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now, let&#8217;s say Mr. Levin&#8217;s prediction is correct. What then?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I daresay the world won&#8217;t end. Things will change for publishers and readers and everyone in between—but things have already been changing and we ought to be used to it by now. It&#8217;s not as if publishers are unaware that this could happen. And it&#8217;s not as if readers are clinging to B&amp;N as their last and only hope for access to books.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Let&#8217;s take a few of the statements in this article and expose them to the light.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em><strong>&#8220;Literary agent David Vigliano says that the disappearance of bookstores, and the move to buying books on Amazon, represents the death of browsing.&#8221;</strong> </em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
No offense to either Mr. Levin or Mr. Vigliano, but this is categorically untrue. Millions of readers are browsing just fine, thank you very much, online and in <em>(gasp)</em> libraries. Why do you think B&amp;N is having so much trouble? Not just because of showrooming (people browsing in the store, then buying online.) But because many, many readers have already made the switch to online browsing and are having no trouble finding the reading material they want.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em><strong>&#8220;Serendipity – the sweet surprise of happening upon an unexpected book – is an experience that can happen only in a bookstore.&#8221;</strong></em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
This feels to me like the ranting of Luddites who can&#8217;t get used to this thing called the Internet. They can&#8217;t believe that it actually WORKS. Again, this statement is so untrue as to be almost ridiculous. Millions of readers are experiencing &#8220;serendipitous&#8221; sweet surprises much more often nowadays via the Internet than they ever could from walking into a bookstore.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em><strong>&#8220;Yes, Amazon&#8217;s algorithms can point you to books you may like, but there&#8217;s no substitute for wandering the aisles of a bookstore, looking into a section you might never have visited before, and finding a new author or subject you had never considered.&#8221;</strong></em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Oh, brother. I regularly find new authors and subjects I&#8217;d never considered—by tuning in to NPR and the Wall Street Journal, by following smart bloggers, by checking Facebook every now and then, by belonging to a book group, by browsing on Goodreads, and by having actual conversations with actual people. I have probably been in B&amp;N five times in the last five years—and I read as many books as almost anyone I know.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em><strong>&#8220;Barnes &amp; Noble killed privately owned bookstores, and Amazon and technology are killing B&amp;N. It&#8217;s downright Darwinian.&#8221;</strong></em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
It took a lot more than B&amp;N to drive many privately-owned bookstores out of business—it was the advent of digital books, and it was <em>all</em> the big stores (Borders, Walmart, Costco, etc), and it was Amazon. But think about it. If B&amp;N folds, it might be exactly what we need to bring back the privately-owned local bookstore that knows how to serve its own community.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Could B&amp;N close this year? Sure. Would it be a tragedy of epic proportions? No, except for the fact that many would lose their jobs because of it. My heart goes out to those people.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Publishers (and writers, and agents, and everyone else in the book food chain) will figure out how to rally. We&#8217;ve been adjusting to massive changes for half a decade already, and there&#8217;s more to come. I understand it&#8217;s difficult to deal with uncertainty (you have <em>no idea</em> how well I understand this). But I&#8217;m so over the drama, and the fear, and the hand-wringing.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Let&#8217;s keep looking ahead at the possible changes in our industry, and asking ourselves: <em>What&#8217;s good about this change? How does it bring us into the future? What do I need to do to adjust to this change? Does it offer any opportunity for me? </em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
I&#8217;d like to hear your thoughts.</p>

I give notes and suggestions for improvements. Sometimes I take them through draft after draft, until everything seems just right.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I know it&#8217;s tiring for them, and sometimes frustrating to be pushed to go over it again and again, especially when they know they&#8217;ll go through more edits with their publisher. I admire every writer who does whatever is necessary, who keeps pushing through, who remains dedicated to making the work the best it can be.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This is what it takes to be good. When an editor pushes you to be your best, or when you push yourself, you&#8217;re doing exactly what&#8217;s necessary to rise above the hordes of regular writers to become a <em>good</em> writer. Along those lines, I read this powerful piece in the book <em>Telling True Stories: A Nonfiction Writers&#8217; Guide from the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University.*</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #110327;">No one, not even the greatest writers, creates good first drafts. &#8220;I have to write crap before I can write anything that is not crap,&#8221; says Walt Harrington, who has been writing well for thirty years. &#8220;Writing is thinking. It is an extension of the reporting process.&#8221; A first draft might have promising sentences or paragraphs, a brilliant conceptualization, a few surprising turns of phrase, or a sturdy framework. All that, however, will probably be barely visible, entangled in the general messiness of half-formed ideas. Those promising elements will reveal themselves as the writer begins to tease apart the mess with the next draft and the one after that.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #110327;">Still, as you read through a flawed first draft, remember that the hardest work is behind you. You have moved closer to defining the topic and developed strategies for explaining it&#8230;. You have stared down the blank page and begun building something on it.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #110327;">Good writing is far too complex to get right in one draft or two or five. Good writers are most often plain ol&#8217; writers who go the extra mile and then a few more.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
If you are struggling through draft after draft, trying to get it right, take heart. You&#8217;re going the extra mile, and then a few more. Keep putting in the work, and you <em>will</em> become a good writer.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #110327;"><em><strong>Are you pushing yourself hard enough? Are you going through enough drafts to push yourself to be a good writer?</strong></em></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Tweet this: <a href="http://ctt.ec/FCmZa" target="_blank">&#8220;Good writers go the extra mile.&#8221; Some encouragement from @RachelleGardner.</a><br />

I&#8217;ve worked with publishers on hundreds of covers, and now I have the experience of working with designers on the cover of my own first e-book. From my perspective, the single most important thing to understand about book covers is:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em><strong>Getting a powerful, appealing, and appropriate cover design is vital, and it&#8217;s more difficult than you might think.</strong></em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Why is it so hard? <em>First,</em> it&#8217;s so subjective. One person&#8217;s great design is another&#8217;s &#8220;fail.&#8221; <em>Second,</em> it&#8217;s more than just creating an image you like—you should take into account the psychology behind what makes a cover appealing to the intended audience. <em>Third,</em> you (the author) may have been living with a particular image in your mind for months or years, but your publisher may disagree and/or your designer may be unable to capture it. <em>Fourth,</em> the book cover can be a highly emotional element of the publishing process, and it&#8217;s supremely disappointing if you don&#8217;t love the finished product.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You&#8217;re going to deal with this whether you&#8217;re working with the publisher&#8217;s designer, or you&#8217;ve hired a designer on your own. The harrowing cover-design process is all-too-common. And my latest experience with my own self-pub book only reinforced this.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #110327;"><em><strong>What I Learned by Using 99 Designs </strong></em></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Authors frequently ask me where they can find a good designer for their self-pub books. I&#8217;d been hearing of <a title="99 Designs" href="http://99designs.com/" target="_blank">99 Designs</a> for the last few years, and didn&#8217;t want to keep recommending them until I&#8217;d tried them myself. So I signed up to see if I could improve upon the original cover of my e-book, <a title="How Do I Decide?" href="http://www.amazon.com/Decide-Self-Publishing-Traditional-Publishing-Authors-ebook/dp/B00B4JRNN8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390747477&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rachelle+gardner+how+do+i+decide" target="_blank">How Do I Decide? Self-Publishing vs. Traditional Publishing</a>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Decide-Self-Publishing-Traditional-Publishing-Authors-ebook/dp/B00B4JRNN8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390747477&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rachelle+gardner+how+do+i+decide"><img class="alignright  wp-image-15004" alt="How Do I Decide?" src="http://3uqu7a1gh6z23dcksz1rpmth.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Rachelle-Ebook-02-Self-vs-Forest-Green-White-Lettering-Small-187x300.jpg" width="112" height="180" /></a><em><strong>How it works</strong></em>:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
With <a title="99 Designs" href="http://99designs.com/" target="_blank">99 Designs</a> you pay a flat fee ranging from about $300 to $1200. Numerous designers submit designs, and you go through a process of feedback and eliminations until you (theoretically) end up with the design you want.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
My original cover is here to the right, and the final winning design from 99 Designs is above. Here&#8217;s my experience and what I learned:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
→ I opted for the least expensive package, which costs $299 and predicts you&#8217;ll receive 30 designs.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
→ Thirty designs <em>sounds</em> like a lot and seems like it should be plenty from which to find a good one. Reality check: <em>it&#8217;s not.</em> A majority of the designs submitted weren&#8217;t even close to being right.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
→ 99 Designs offers a money-back guarantee, so that if the process doesn&#8217;t yield a design you can use, you can get a refund. However, one way you can get more designs submitted is to turn down the possibility of a refund and guarantee you&#8217;ll pick a winner. Since this means a designer will definitely win and get paid, more designers will submit, and work hard to adjust their designs according to your specifications so they can win the contest. I chose this option and it definitely seemed to increase the action on my page.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
→ A 99 Designs contest runs seven days, and it&#8217;s crucial for you to set aside ample time during that week to devote to the contest. If you want to end up with a design you love, you&#8217;ll need to interact constantly with the designers who are submitting.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
→ When you set up your contest, it&#8217;s important to give the designers detailed instructions, making your requirements as clear as possible. Explain what your book is about, and the tone you want to convey with the cover. What is the feeling you want to evoke? Do you have specific images in mind? Mention anything you wish to avoid.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
→ Once you begin receiving designs, take the time to give detailed feedback to each designer. This can vastly improve your chances of getting a final product you like.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
→ Once you have several designs you like, 99 Designs makes it easy for you to run a poll among your Facebook or Twitter friends, or on your blog. Your friends can vote on the ones they like, and leave feedback on each design. This can be confusing (as people&#8217;s opinions can be so varied) yet also illuminating and helpful.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
→ 99 Designs also makes it possible for you to work one-on-one with individual designers. If you run a contest and find a designer you like, then in the future you can choose to work specifically with that person. Or, you can browse the work of the designers on the site and choose to work with one designer without ever having run a contest.<br />

By the time my contest was over, I&#8217;d received 104 entries, but I honestly couldn&#8217;t say I loved any of them. I may not have given enough instructions and feedback, and I probably didn&#8217;t explain my book well enough, so I take responsibility for it. I have seen some terrific book covers come from 99 Designs, especially for fiction.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I&#8217;d definitely use 99 Designs again, following my own advice (above) to increase my odds of success. And I definitely recommend the service to authors and others looking for any kind of design.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em><strong>Anything to add from your own experience with 99 Designs or hiring a freelance designer? Any comments or questions about this process?</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-14993" alt="red pen spilling ink" src="http://3uqu7a1gh6z23dcksz1rpmth.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/red-pen-spilling-ink-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" />I just finished reading a self-published book on a topic I&#8217;m passionate about, by an author whose blog I occasionally read. As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, I regularly read self-pubbed books, and the fact that I work in traditional publishing doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m biased against them.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It does, however, mean I&#8217;m aware of the ways a book could have been better, had the author availed themselves of the best assistance available, whether in design, writing, editing, cover, or even title.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I was excited to read this book—a memoir—and it started out promising. But it quickly devolved into a self-focused, rambling hodgepodge of preaching interspersed with bragging. I did finish the book (luckily it was rather short) but I ended up with strongly negative feelings toward the author. Since this was a memoir, I doubt that&#8217;s what the author was going for.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I think the author got some friends to edit the book, maybe even somebody with writing experience. But it&#8217;s clear he never consulted a professional book editor, especially not one with expertise in memoir. This is a genre that is notoriously difficult to pull off. The author needed a strong memoir editor, but since he didn&#8217;t have one, I can&#8217;t recommend the book to anyone.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So, how could an editor have improved the book? Here are my thoughts:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>A good editor would have coached the author to find his main theme,</strong> and to focus tightly on it, cutting out rabbit trails and eliminating entertaining stories that didn&#8217;t fit in this book. The editor could have helped decide which stories should stay and which should go (often difficult for a memoirist, because they&#8217;re so close to the material).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>An editor would have conveyed that teaching and preaching don&#8217;t belong in a memoir.</strong> Save that for another book — a how-to or self-help. The memoir is your story and your reflections on your story, but should avoid the self-help vibe.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>An editor would have eliminated bragging,</strong> and suggested ways to convey moments of success or triumph without sounding arrogant.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>An editor would have brought out the importance of a humble tone,</strong> of admitting the journey isn&#8217;t over and you&#8217;re still learning, a sort of &#8220;fellow pilgrim&#8221; approach. When your story is nothing but triumph and &#8220;look what a great thing I did,&#8221; real people don&#8217;t tend to relate to your message.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>An editor would have challenged the author to truly let the reader in.</strong> Authenticity and vulnerability are hallmarks of powerful memoirs, and this one has neither. I had the feeling of skimming over the surface, never quite being allowed in.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>An editor would have ensured readers didn&#8217;t feel like complete losers</strong> if they don&#8217;t currently share the author&#8217;s lifestyle.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>An editor would have protected the author&#8217;s reputation.</strong>  The author conveyed a message he may not have intended by including certain observations and behaviors unrelated to the theme of the book, but which made him seem like a womanizer and a bit of a sexist. A savvy editor would have gently inquired if this was really what the author wanted readers to take away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>With regard to editors, it boils down to the importance of objective, qualified feedback. Businesses spent over <em>$1oo billion</em> on leadership development last year. Why? Because it&#8217;s really hard to see yourself clearly and commit to change. Authors are no different. A good editor has the courage to give you the feedback your buddies won&#8217;t. It&#8217;s their job. And they make your writing better as a result.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em><strong>Have you ever had the experience of working with an editor who improved your work and helped you say exactly what you wanted to say?</strong></em><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-14989" alt="gold medal" src="http://3uqu7a1gh6z23dcksz1rpmth.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/gold-medal-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" />In our house, we&#8217;re getting ready for competition season in gymnastics to begin this weekend. My daughter is a USAG level 7 gymnast with some pretty ambitious goals and it takes a lot of the family&#8217;s time and focus.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
But recently my daughter was convinced she needed to quit gymnastics (after seven years and thousands of hours in the gym). Her coach and I were asking her why and she told us:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>She didn&#8217;t feel like she was doing well and didn&#8217;t feel successful.</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>She&#8217;d had some setbacks (injuries) and was finding it hard to recover.</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>It felt like it was taking forever to improve.</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Her coach just looked at her and flat-out said, &#8220;You&#8217;re too good to quit. I need you on my team.&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
After that, the coach began asking questions. <em>What do you feel like you&#8217;re not doing well? What&#8217;s your definition of being &#8220;successful&#8221;?</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
My daughter felt like she should be coming in first place in every event at every meet. She&#8217;s had her share of medals, but nobody can win &#8216;em all. Her coach asked her if maybe she could reframe her definition of success, and together they came up with a more workable definition.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The coach helped her see that it&#8217;s normal for recovery from setbacks to take time and be painful; and also reminded her that gymnastics is a sport that takes years to learn; that slow progress is the only way; and that nobody ever really masters it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
My daughter came up with some new goals and embraced a more realistic view of the time and effort her sport requires. She decided to go back to basics — to focus on having fun, and to be consistently improving.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
She decided not to quit.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Have you had those moments when you felt like you weren&#8217;t successful enough to continue? When you were frustrated at how long it&#8217;s taking? When the setbacks (rejections) felt so painful you just didn&#8217;t know if you could keep going?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Have you ever felt like quitting?</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>What made you continue?</strong><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-14972" alt="Excellence" src="http://3uqu7a1gh6z23dcksz1rpmth.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/10227386_s-300x233.jpg" width="210" height="163" />It seems in the last few years, dialogue about all-things-publishing has been focused on platform, marketing, increasing output, distribution platforms, technology, and self-publishing. (This blog is no exception.) But as I noted in <a title="2014 Publishing Predictions" href="http://www.authormedia.com/2014-publishing-predictions/" target="_blank">this post at Author Media </a>, <strong>I think it&#8217;s important to call our attention back to the work. </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
It may be easier to get published these days because of self-pub and the proliferation of indie publishing options. <strong>But it&#8217;s not any easier to write a good book. </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
In fact, it may be even harder to write a good book than it was in days past, because <strong>both you and your reader have more distractions</strong>. You&#8217;re tempted by the Internet, your ability to concentrate for long periods of time has been compromised, and deep focus is more challenging. Meanwhile, your reader has infinite sources of information and entertainment. So a book has to be darn good to to keep both your attention and your reader&#8217;s. Now is the time to make sure we&#8217;re not minimizing the importance of mastering the craft.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Yes, platform is important if you want people to read your stuff. But ultimately, great writing is the best platform. <strong>A million followers are meaningless if you don&#8217;t have something worthwhile for them to read.</strong> Marketing challenges, evolving technology, and competition will always be with us. But it&#8217;s irrelevant without a good book.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I sense, out there in writer-land, an increasing focus on writing <em>more-more-more</em>. Many want to publish as fast as possible. Volume + speed = more money, or more success, or some such equation that I can&#8217;t quite wrap my mind around. But I do understand that this environment is leaving some writers feeling insecure, thinking they&#8217;ll be left behind if they don&#8217;t join the fray.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This agitated state of the collective mind is caused by information overload. Too many stories floating around out there, and no way to know the exact truth of each one. Anxiety comes from hearing about the accomplishments of 1% of writers and not the 99% who are slogging away in the trenches, many experiencing their own kinds of success.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And while <em>more-more-more</em> seems to be the mantra for some writers, readers can only read so much. They&#8217;ll have shrinking patience for works that feel sloppily crafted and hastily written.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>The only way forward is the same as it ever was: run away from the noise, hunker down and wrestle mightily with your prose.</strong> Writing your best book is what matters, regardless of how many people ever read it. And in a nice bit of synchronicity, it&#8217;s what will make people want to read it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As an agent, I&#8217;m here to help with the &#8220;other stuff.&#8221; Only you, the writer, can do the most important part. Write that book. And make it great.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Let&#8217;s collectively settle into 2014 remembering that mastering the craft is the best object of our focus. There is a time for considering various publishing routes and promoting our works, but only when we have in our hands a book that is the absolute best it can be.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #110327;"><em><strong>So where are you on this? Are you mainly focused on craft, or do you spend a great deal of energy focused on other aspects of publishing? What is the right balance?</strong></em></span></h3>

<p>Happy new year! As we begin 2014, talk is everywhere about our goals, resolutions and plans. Many of you have chosen &#8220;one word&#8221; that will serve as a focal point throughout 2014. Choosing a word has become popular in the last five years or so, and I like it because it&#8217;s a concise way to distill the theme of all my new year&#8217;s goals into one simple expression.</p>
<p>So I wanted to share my word for 2014 with you. It is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><span style="color: #110327;">&#8220;Vitality&#8221;</span></strong></em></h2>
<p>Over the last year, I&#8217;ve become increasingly aware of the need to bring my best energy into every aspect of my life. I have to be intentional about showing up with zeal, and approaching every task with the urgency it deserves. I have to keep my momentum going and not allow it to falter.</p>
<p>It seems obvious—like it would go without saying. But I&#8217;ve noticed how easy it is to fall into the routine of &#8220;another day at the office&#8221; even though I&#8217;m lucky enough to have a career I love. By focusing on the word &#8220;vitality,&#8221; I&#8217;ll have a daily reminder to bring my A-game every single day. I have numerous clients, but each of my clients only has one agent, and every interaction we have is important. They deserve my best, every time.</p>
<p>Bringing vitality to my personal life is crucial too. My family and friends deserve my best. There&#8217;s no time for laziness—everything will be more meaningful if I consciously apply my energy to it.</p>
<p>How will I maintain my vitality? My other new year&#8217;s goals all center around this overriding objective. Choosing to stay mindful of the purpose and vision I have for my life will keep me passionate about the day-to-day work. Getting enough exercise, sleep and healthy food will keep me energized. Enjoying all the exciting projects I&#8217;m privileged to work on brings a vitality all its own.</p>
<p>So this year, I&#8217;m focusing on vitality, and I&#8217;ve already got the word posted, big and bold, above my computer. And by putting it out there to you, I&#8217;m now accountable to it.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #110327;"><em><strong>Do you have a word, or a goal, for 2014 that you&#8217;d like to share? Why did you choose it?</strong></em></span></h3>

<p>Hey&#8230; you.</p>
<p>Yeah, you, the one sitting alone in your basement hammering out a thousand words every morning before you go to work.</p>
<p>And you. The one filling out your registration for a writers conference and terrified to click &#8220;send.&#8221;</p>
<p>And you in the back, there&#8230; frantically taking notes in the writing workshop, attempting to be invisible.</p>
<p>And what about you, about to sit down at your first-ever meeting with an agent, trembling with nervousness.</p>
<p>And you, the writer who&#8217;s signed your first publishing contract and suddenly feel the pressure of deadlines and marketing and expectations.</p>
<p>And you, the multi-published author, thankful for your good fortune and praying everyday the words continue to flow.</p>
<p>I just wanted you to know that I see you. I know you&#8217;re there. I hear what you&#8217;re saying, I feel your fears, I love your passion, I understand a lot about what drives you and what terrifies you.</p>
<p>And I admire you. I am so incredibly awed by your bravery. I know it takes courage to do what you&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;m impressed with your persistence, your enthusiasm, your dedication.</p>
<p>I know it takes sacrifice. I know you give up a lot&#8230; I know it&#8217;s a significant cost to go to a conference; it&#8217;s a significant commitment of time to write books and build platforms (and read blogs).</p>
<p>I just want to thank you for what you&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;m so glad you get up every morning and do what you do. I&#8217;m so happy you&#8217;re up for the challenge.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because of you that I&#8217;ve been a reader my whole life. It&#8217;s because of you that I love books. It&#8217;s because of you that I&#8217;ve had the good fortune to work for the last eighteen years in a career I absolutely love.</p>
<p>You are incredible. Keep up the good work. Keep writing&#8230; so I can keep reading. And thank you.</p>

&nbsp;<br />
Self-motivation is crucial for authors, regardless of which publishing path you choose. Writing a book is difficult enough, but when you add on editing and marketing, it can feel impossible. And I&#8217;m crazy enough to have self-published 32 times. How did I do it? I learned a few ways to trick myself into doing work when my brain wants nothing but mindless entertainment.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Tricks for Writing</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
My inner critic hates it when I write. This voice in my head enjoys pointing out all the faults in my work and howls with laughter when I close up shop early for the day. My most prolific writing periods came after I silenced the inner critic.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I accomplished this in two distinct ways. The first method was writing so early in the morning that the critic had yet to wake up. By the time my resistant inner critic woke up, I was already in the zone and the blank page was nothing but a memory. The second method was giving my critic something bigger to complain about, like not reaching my word count goal for the day. I set a word count goal of 2,500 words per day. I also wrote the goal down and said it out loud each day. This repetition pushed me to fulfill my goal even when I was exhausted.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Tricks for Editing</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
I hate editing. When you&#8217;re first starting out as a writer and you can&#8217;t afford to pay someone to take your book off your hands, it&#8217;s a necessary evil. As with completing any other undesirable task, setting up a reward system is a viable option. If I completed a certain task, like editing a chapter, I would give myself a food reward, an entertainment reward or a social reward. I wasn&#8217;t able to edit that much in one sitting at first, but my tolerance grew as I got more into the routine of edit, reward, repeat.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
My other editing trick is to have a separate location where my editing takes place. This can be as simple as making your office the place for writing and your kitchen the location for editing. Even a tiny change in your surroundings can give you the boost you need.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Tricks for Marketing</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
While I&#8217;ve always loved coming up with marketing plans for myself, I&#8217;ve found the writing, editing and publishing process takes a lot out of me. I realized I needed extra motivation to spend time marketing, so I started listening to self-help programs. Listening to the inspiring words of Stephen Covey, Marci Shimoff and more helped to motivate me to work harder.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you&#8217;re not an audiobook person, you can try borrowing inspiring books from the library, printing out and posting motivational quotes or visualizing yourself completing all your marketing tasks.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I also have a last ditch plan when I need to do a mindless marketing task like sending out e-mails or filling out promotional forms on websites over and over again. I will rent a movie and put it on my wife&#8217;s computer. I&#8217;ll sit down with my laptop and watch a mindless Hollywood blockbuster while I send out the mindless e-mails and forms. When I&#8217;ve been putting something off and I just need two more hours, this trick works like a charm.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Being a self-published author is like running your own small publishing house. You need to wear a lot of hats and put in countless hours to make your work a success. If you feel like there just aren&#8217;t enough hours in the day, try out one of these tricks to get you going again.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-14916" alt="Art &amp; business" src="http://3uqu7a1gh6z23dcksz1rpmth.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/15405208_s-300x256.jpg" width="300" height="256" />One of the biggest challenges for many writers is being able to <strong>separate the artist self from the business self</strong>, and figuring out ways to nurture both.</p>
<p>I find this to be an issue for unpublished authors more than those who are published. Once a writer is published, they seem highly motivated to <strong>stay published</strong>, and therefore more open to considering ways to increase the commercial appeal of their work.</p>
<p>But for some new or unpublished authors, there seems to be a resistance to “commercializing” their art. That’s fine, if you want to write for yourself, your family and your friends. But if the goal is to ask strangers to pay money to read your work, then it deserves a different approach.</p>
<p>It recently occurred to me that writers might benefit by taking a break from reading books on writing, and occasionally <strong>read some business-related books</strong>.</p>
<p>All the <em>specifics</em> in a business book might not apply to the writing life, but the overall message can be helpful in learning how to approach writing as a business or even a career. It can help you adopt the mindset of running a successful business and teach you to ask the right questions as you consider what kinds of books to write, and how to write them. These books can open your eyes to everything from how consumers make buying decisions, to how to create a successful brand, to how to organize your time for maximum effectiveness.</p>
<p>As I’ve spoken with several of my clients who have multiple books published, it’s been interesting to see how they approach the constant necessity to keep drawing in readers: rather than feeling like they’re “selling out,” they savor the challenge of getting better and better at crafting words into books that people want to read. They are able to see<strong> the art in running a successful business.</strong> They look for the stories or topics that interest them, and then ask themselves where their own interests meet the demands of the marketplace.</p>
<p><em><strong>Are you comfortable with approaching writing as a business? What helps you nurture this mindset? How do you balance your artistic self with your business self?</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-14898" alt="Lone Ranger" src="http://3uqu7a1gh6z23dcksz1rpmth.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12154066_s-300x222.jpg" width="240" height="178" />In publishing, we&#8217;re constantly asking writers—typically a rather introverted bunch—to get involved, to engage, to network, to join groups and go to conferences. I often find myself wondering how many of you cringe every time you hear that kind of advice.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Maybe you&#8217;re not into the whole publishing &#8220;scene.&#8221; Maybe you don&#8217;t enjoy being in a critique group where people discuss your work.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Maybe you don&#8217;t want to be part of a crowd, you don&#8217;t want to go to workshops, you don&#8217;t think of writing as a group activity. </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Maybe social media is not your thing. The thought of promoting your book gives you hives. You don&#8217;t want to be a speaker or a blogger or a Facebook expert.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Can such a person find success in publishing?</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Yes—but these days it&#8217;s rare.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You&#8217;d have to be pretty darned talented to begin with. If you&#8217;re not going to workshops to learn, and you&#8217;re not getting feedback on your work, then in order to snag an agent and a publisher, or even find a large audience through self-publishing, you&#8217;d have to be writing amazing stuff without benefit of the collaborative process. There are definitely some writers who can pull this off. You may be one of them. The only way to know is to try it and see what happens.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There are still stories of writers getting their agent through the query process, without ever networking or getting a referral or going to a conference. <strong>But eventually you&#8217;ll need to build an audience for your book, whether you&#8217;re with a publisher or doing it yourself.</strong> You are going to have to engage with your readers and potential ones.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Most of that can be done online, so if you&#8217;re at least comfortable with blogs and social networking, you should be able to market yourself just fine. You don&#8217;t necessarily have to be &#8220;out there&#8221; promoting except in the virtual world.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>For all the emphasis on critique groups and workshops and conferences, we recognize the reality that not all writers are cut out for all that.</strong> While this kind of involvement does offer terrific advantages for those who are able to do it—and there are some people who would never find success if they didn&#8217;t avail themselves of every possible resource—all is not lost if you can&#8217;t.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In the past, writers have told me they can&#8217;t afford conferences, or don&#8217;t have access to them because they live in a remote location. Some have said they haven&#8217;t been able to find a critique group. I tell them it&#8217;s up to them to find success despite the limitations.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
But I rarely hear from writers who say, &#8220;I am not interested in all that group stuff. I am a writer! I sit in my cave and write — <em>by myself</em>. I have no desire to do it any other way.&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Today&#8217;s your chance.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="color: #110327;"><em><strong>If you&#8217;re a solo writer who cringes at the thought of a conference, critique group, or workshop, please tell us about your experience. If you can&#8217;t stand the idea of promoting your work — what&#8217;s that like for you? </strong></em></span></h4>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Everything-Store-Bezos-Amazon-ebook/dp/B00BWQW73E"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-14907" alt="The Everything Store" src="http://3uqu7a1gh6z23dcksz1rpmth.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/The-Everything-Store.jpg" width="180" height="280" /></a>I’ve just finished reading Brad Stone&#8217;s <a title="The Everything Store" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Everything-Store-Bezos-Amazon-ebook/dp/B00BWQW73E" target="_blank"><em>The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon</em></a>. I&#8217;m still processing what I learned, and checking other sources for differing perspectives, but my initial reaction is that this is an eye-opening, clarifying, sobering yet illuminating resource for anyone interested in publishing or business in general.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I approached this book the same way I&#8217;ve always approached Amazon: (1) as an Amazon customer, and (2) as a person employed by traditional publishing. The two perspectives leave me feeling a little whiplashed at times, since they induce two opposing views of Amazon.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>As a customer, I&#8217;ve always been extremely happy.</strong> I&#8217;m a Kindle reader, a Prime member, and I use Amazon almost every day.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>As a publishing professional, it hasn&#8217;t been quite so easy.</strong> In the beginning Amazon was a terrific customer for publishers and authors. Over the years the company has evolved into a ruthless competitor—while still being our primary customer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Along with everyone else, I watched the evolution of Amazon. But until I read <em>The Everything Store</em>, I didn&#8217;t have a full understanding of exactly how it all went down. And I didn&#8217;t understand Bezos&#8217; approach to his business, which often amounts to a scorched-earth policy.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The &#8220;customer&#8221; side of me loves being wooed and treated well. <strong>The &#8220;publishing&#8221; side of me has to deal with the fact that our biggest customer is also our fiercest rival.</strong> This rival has unparalleled leverage over other businesses including publishers, and is not shy about using it to compel cooperation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I&#8217;ve loved Amazon over the years. I admire the company for so many reasons. I&#8217;m blown away by their innovation and the way they constantly re-evaluate their business and come up with new and better ways to serve their customers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>But I don&#8217;t like how their domination can come at such a high price.</strong> In a couple of notable instances when Amazon wanted to purchase other companies (Zappos.com and Diapers.com), Amazon used its power to launch price wars rather than stay at the negotiating table, bullying the companies into selling at the price Amazon wanted.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When it comes to publishers, Amazon has used the formidable power of its technology to remove all of a certain publishers’ books from Kindle sales; and at another time, to remove publishers’ books from their powerful book-recommendation engine, causing those publishers’ sales to drop significantly. Amazon is willing to use hardball tactics rather than negotiation when it suits their purpose.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Everyone knows the publishing business is struggling. But it&#8217;s not just because of technology and the changing environment. <strong>There was a tipping point that changed everything for publishers: the $9.99 e-book introduced by Amazon.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
While publishers had been in talks with Amazon for months, providing Amazon with files and metadata to start translating books into Kindle e-books, Amazon never spoke a word about a plan to sell the e-books for such a low cost. It was sprung on publishers at a moment when it was far too late to back away. As one publishing executive put it, “It was one more nail in the coffin that no one realized was being closed over us, even while we were engaged every single day in a conversation about it.”<br />
&nbsp;<br />
At $9.99 for an e-book, publishers could no longer make their margins. All of the economics of publishing began to change. Readers became accustomed to e-books at low prices (which, of course, has been greatly intensified by the massive influx of self-published books at rock-bottom prices). Lawsuits were filed, the &#8220;agency model&#8221; was born, and Amazon has continued to use their leverage to convince publishers to toe the line.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Publishers remain dependent on Amazon, which remains simultaneously their biggest customer and fiercest competitor.</strong> It is a precarious place for publishers to be.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I’m not advocating a return to the old days. When cars were invented, there was no going back to the horse-and-buggy no matter how badly it hurt the business of the blacksmith and the saddle-maker. We’re in a new world—a better world—and there’s no going back.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>But there are downsides to a single company having so much power.</strong> I think it comes down to this: We know Amazon can negotiate, and behave fairly. But we cannot trust them to do so. When it serves their purpose, they’ll play hardball to get what they want.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So here we sit—loyal Amazon customers. Admiring Amazon as a hugely successful company. Working with Amazon to do everything possible to help our books sell. And wondering when the next nail in the coffin will come, and what it will look like.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Still, as quickly as we’ve seen the rise of Amazon (and Google, and Facebook, and Apple, and…) we will keep seeing things continue to change. The story isn’t over. <strong>Monopolies don’t last forever.</strong> If you don’t believe me… can I sell you a Blackberry?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>The Everything Store</em> is a fascinating and informative story, but definitely not the final chapter in how books are published, sold, and read. I’m excited to see the story continue. And I&#8217;m still conflicted about Amazon.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em><strong>What about you?</strong></em><br />
<em><strong> Are you conflicted in your views of Amazon?</strong></em><br />
<em><strong> What do you think is coming next in this brave new world of publishing?</strong></em><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-14886" alt="target-on-your-back" src="http://3uqu7a1gh6z23dcksz1rpmth.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/target-on-your-back-220x300.jpg" width="220" height="300" /><strong>Once you&#8217;re a published author, you&#8217;re going to have a target on your back.</strong> You will offer up your words to strangers, and not everyone will like what you write. You&#8217;ll be naked and vulnerable in front of the world. You&#8217;ll make mistakes, you may offend people. And you may not feel safe.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
They will write things publicly about you, on their blogs, on <em>your</em> blog, on book review sites, or on Amazon. One of my friends recently received this review online: &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t even finish this book&#8230; Confusing and in my humble opinion, pointless.&#8221; <em>Ouch</em>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Everyone has a right to their opinion. In fact, diversity of opinions is something that makes book publishing so dynamic and interesting. <strong>But sometimes those opinions hit us like flaming arrows.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
I&#8217;ve had this happen numerous times on the blog. I&#8217;ll write something with which some folks disagree, or something that gets peoples&#8217; hackles up. I may be intending to float an idea and solicit input, spur thinking or spark conversation. Whether I succeed or fail is completely up to the reader.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And that&#8217;s the point. Your <em>intent</em> doesn&#8217;t matter to readers. What matters is what they <em>perceive</em> as your intent, and whether they like what you&#8217;ve written, period. If they don&#8217;t, their response can be brutal.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Anyone in the &#8220;public eye&#8221; – and if you have any online presence, that means you – is a target for criticism.</strong> People can and will say anything they want. They will misinterpret what you&#8217;ve written, they will assign motives, and they&#8217;ll make judgments about you as a human being.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So what can we do about this? Here are three things.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="color: #110327;"><strong>(1) Don&#8217;t engage with those who criticize you.</strong> </span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
There are few good exceptions to this guideline. I&#8217;ve rarely seen an author&#8217;s public response to criticism turn out well. Your attempts to engage in a conversation with your detractors won’t likely do any more than add fuel to the fire. Let people say what they will.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="color: #110327;"><strong>(2) Listen and learn.</strong> </span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Sometimes there’s helpful criticism wrapped in a harshly worded comment or critique. It’s possible that your interpretation of someone&#8217;s apparently hurtful intent may be wrong, too. If the comment is simply mean-spirited or self-serving, let it bounce off, but don&#8217;t be so Teflon-coated that even helpful advice can&#8217;t get through.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="color: #110327;"><strong>(3) Be careful with your own words</strong>. </span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
As you offer <em>your</em> criticism to other writers, bloggers, agents or anyone else in cyberspace, think before you hit &#8220;send.&#8221; Treat others as you&#8217;d like to be treated. Offer grace. Offer constructive criticism intended to build up rather than harsh judgment intended to tear down. <strong>Remember there is a real live person behind the written words. </strong>If you have a particularly scathing piece of feedback, send it in private (via email?) rather than airing it in public. You may discover you’re reading the person’s motives all wrong and she might (gasp) thank you for pointing out how they could have been misread. You could even find a new friend.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Regardless of who you are or how kindhearted your intent, if you&#8217;re a writer in pursuit of publication, eventually you&#8217;re going to be judged.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Carry a shield. And treat other authors as if they don’t.</strong><br />
