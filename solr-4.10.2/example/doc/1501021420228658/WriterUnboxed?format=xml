<p>I know, I know—an article in early January about New Year’s resolutions? How original is that? But I happen to be a list maker junkie and New Year’s resolutions are the mother of all lists, so I can’t help it. I look forward to setting new goals, charting my progress, marking off the accomplishments on the list (yes, I’m a geek). Lots of people despise resolutions and feel they set us up for failure, disappointment, and self-loathing (and who needs any more of those?), so if it’s not your thing, no worries. They work for me, and my only hard and fast motto for this crazy business of writing is “whatever works.” If making writing resolutions sounds like something that might galvanize you, too, then here are some tips that make your resolutions more likely to stick.</p>
<p><strong>START WITH THE REVERSE OF RESOLUTIONS</strong></p>
<p>While it <em>is</em> important to challenge ourselves, it’s <em>just as</em> important to acknowledge the things we <em>already</em> accomplished. I know, I know, we are taught not to “toot our own horn,” but really, it’s good to take a look at all you’ve done in the course of a year—good for the soul, good for the ego, just plain good any way you look at it. Take an indulgent, congratulatory look at all the cool stuff you did between this year and last. It will make you feel proud, it will make you feel kinder towards yourself, and it’s a nice affirmation.</p>
<p>Some years, your list might include more “biggies” than others, for example “I landed an agent,” or “I published my fifth novel,” or, for me, 2014 included “I finally started teaching online writing classes after people have been bugging me to for years” (I have brand new ones beginning January 15 if you’re interested&#8230;) and “finished a draft of a new novel.”</p>
<p>But be sure to include accomplishments no one else might recognize or know about, such as: “Never got lost a single time while renting a car on book tour” or “Stopped going to writing group with X because it was toxic and not giving me anything.”</p>
<p>You get the idea. Nothing that comes to mind is too small to include. Sometimes, on discouraging days, it helps to go back and read your list—especially on days you feel you aren’t living up to your resolutions. You’ll go over your list and think, “Look at me. Look at all I did. Okay, tomorrow is another day. I’m inspired to do better.”</p>
<p>Start making <em>your</em> list. Look at you! Look at how strong, kickass and interesting you are!</p>
<p>Don’t you feel better already?</p>
<p><strong>MAKE SURE THE OUTCOME IS IN YOUR OWN HANDS</strong></p>
<p>As you make a list of resolutions for your writing life in 2015, don’t allow anyone else to control your success or failure. It’s not a good idea to resolve “I will be published in 2015” or “I will become a bestseller in 2015” because that outcome is not something <em>you</em> can actually control. <span id="more-34884"></span>Publishing can be a capricious and crazy-making business. If you want to be published, list resolutions such as “I will create an excellent query letter for my novel” and “I will submit queries to agents beginning in March” or what have you. Those are things that will certainly set you on the path to publication, but more importantly, they are goals <em>you</em> control.</p>
<p><strong>MAKE YOUR RESOLUTIONS CHALLENGING BUT DOABLE</strong></p>
<p>Both parts of that sentence are important. Challenging is key. It’s one of the reasons people bother to make resolutions at all—you are trying to kick start your productivity, get yourself out of your comfort zone, push yourself in some way. But don’t set yourself up for failure by setting insane and impossible goals. In my Inspiration &amp; Motivation class, I first coach students to carve out a writing schedule and keep it sacred. It’s a mistake for a relatively new writer to declare “I will write every day for four hours.” They’re not likely to sustain that kind of discipline, and then, after a week or so of failing to live up to that resolution, chances are they scrap the whole idea. Make your goal <em>doable</em>, and if you find you are accomplishing your goals with flying colors, celebrate it (more on that later) and then raise the bar for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>KNOW THY ENEMIES</strong></p>
<p>Chances are, there are reasons why you haven’t already met this particular goal you’re resolving to meet; that’s why you’re resolving to do it now. It’s crucial to assess and be aware of the enemy to meeting this goal. Another exercise we do in my Inspiration &amp; Motivation class is to identify what has kept you from meeting your goal in the past. What do you foresee being an obstacle to meeting your goal in 2015? First, identify it. Then, decide what preemptive plan will prevent this same obstacle from foiling you again. You have to be brutally honest and defensive. I’ll admit it: Facebook was/is a huge enemy to my writing time and productivity. For me, it’s a rabbit hole, a giant time suck. So, for starters, my plan was to set a stopwatch when I logged in so I could track my time, kind of like punching a time card. Well, that didn’t work! I’m embarrassed to say that I’d tell myself “I’m just going to change my status and answer messages and I’ll be off in ten minutes,” but the reality was (revealed by my stopwatch) that an hour would go by! So, I began to use my timer instead, and set an alarm for ten minutes so the time couldn’t slip away. Which leads me to&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>HAVE MONTHLY CHECK-INS TO SEE HOW YOU’RE PROGRESSING TOWARD YOUR GOALS</strong></p>
<p>You need to set time to assess how you’re doing. I was able to see my little time card plan was a bust and figured out something else. Seems obvious, I know, but if you don’t actually set a time to take a good objective look at how you’re doing, you might end up spinning your wheels and reinforcing bad habits. Be willing to make changes. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results. Don’t be insane. But also&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>CELEBRATE EVERY SINGLE SMALL SUCCESS</strong></p>
<p>Don’t be stingy! Be good to yourself. Any time you can mark something off your list or you do a check-in and recognize you’re right on track, <em>celebrate it</em>. I firmly believe celebrating each small accomplishment keeps them happening, and all those small steps build up to big leaps. Reward your writer self however you see fit—ice cream? A new writing book? A trip to a book store? A weekend writing retreat? Just as only you will know what your obstacles will be and what is doable for you, only you will know what is a worthy celebration.</p>
<p>Dan Blank wrote beautifully about this here last month in his post “Do You Have the Clarity to Celebrate Success?” (<a href="http://writerunboxed.com/2014/12/16/do-you-have-the-clarity-to-celebrate-success/#more-34735">http://writerunboxed.com/2014/12/16/do-you-have-the-clarity-to-celebrate-success/#more-34735</a>). If you didn’t read it then, I highly recommend you return to it now.</p>
<p>I wish you all the best with your writing projects in the New Year. May the words and inspiration flow for you in 2015!</p>
<p><strong>Will you track any of your writing goals this year? How? If you had goals for 2014, did you reach them?</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.” ~Henry David Thoreau</strong></p>
<p>For those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, we are just on the other side of the solstice, in the dark, dark days. Light is precious, especially when many of our waking hours are spent under low, heavy clouds, enduring winter storms, or in the lethargic state prevalent at this time of year. (Can you tell I need my happy light?)</p>
<p>I have great admiration for creatures who hibernate, but since I can’t cozy up in a cave to wait it out, I thought I’d look to the future for momentum. Like many others, I use this time to set my creative goals, which are two-fold: first, to get my forthcoming novel <em>The House of Hawthorne</em> (NAL/Penguin Random House, May 5<sup>th</sup>) into the hands of the <em>first </em>readers who would most enjoy it, and second, to complete a new historical novel that does not have a famous dead writer as a protagonist, but rather, a very specific setting and time period.</p>
<p>I asked a group of authors whom I admire to share their goals for 2015 with me. Their answers were humorous, heartfelt, reassuring, and inspirational. I hope they are for you, too.<span id="more-34927"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>“After two writing projects (let’s call them books) that didn&#8217;t quite gel, I’m hoping 2015 is the year that the third one is a charm.  Here’s to someone thinking what I’ve got is worth sharing and here’s to this next year being one where I can learn how to meditate for even ten minutes.” ~Lee Woodruff, NY Times Bestselling Author of <em>Those We Love Most</em></p>
<p>“I&#8217;ll be publishing my biography of Daphne Du Maurier in March 2015 in France and then hopefully in other countries. She is my favorite writer, a great inspiration for me, and writing her life was a tremendous experience.” ~Tatiana de Rosnay, Internationally Bestselling Author of <em>Sarah’s Key</em></p>
<p>&#8220;In 2015, I hope to finish work on my sixth novel, &#8220;The Painted Dove&#8221; about the French courtesan Marthe de Florian and the mystery of her Paris apartment that remained locked for 70 years.  I&#8217;ve been relishing working on a novel than spans the Belle Epoque to Paris just before its German occupation in WWII.&#8221; ~Alyson Richman, Bestselling author of <em>The Lost Wife</em></p>
<p>“The first order of business is to complete what I hope will be the final major rewrite of my new book, and then to herd the text through the gauntlet of line edits and copy edits that await. Oh yes, finding a title would be good, too. When I finally head into the foothills of my new project, I’ll be confronting the same old challenges, no less confounding for their familiarity: to find a healthy equilibrium between my writing, my family, and my legal career; to write with passion and humility and maybe the occasional pretty sentence; and to always, always tell the truth.” ~Alex George, Bestselling author of <em>A Good American</em></p>
<p>“I&#8217;m hoping not only to finish my new novel, but more importantly, to savor the process. As exciting as launching <em>Chasing the Sun</em> was in 2014, the real reason we do this is for the moments that happen on the page, so I&#8217;m making it a point to relish them.” ~Natalia Sylvester, Author of <em>Chasing the Sun</em></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;2014 was a year of waiting. Interminable waiting, it often seemed. In mid-summer I finished a first draft of my third novel. In the time since, I’ve waited for myself (to figure out how to fix what was wrong with the book), I’ve waited for my wife (to tell me what was still wrong with the book), I’ve waited for trusted friends (to help me fix what was still wrong the book), I’ve waited again for myself (for the time to fix all that was wrong with the book). And I’ve waited for agents and editors (to let the business end of this whole endeavor unfold). For much—maybe most—of the time I spent waiting, I was downright fretful. Naturally, I told myself over and over again. This was three years worth of work, after all. But all that waiting took its toll, and only as the holidays rolled around did I convince myself that the waiting is something almost entirely out of my control, and in order to restore my own peace of mind, I vowed to get to work on something new. Which I did. And so now I vow to relish the work and forget the waiting. In this game, you’re always waiting for something. The rewards can seem scant because of how much time passes between them. But the <i>pleasure</i>, that’s something that can be found anytime the fingers find the keyboard. And so I vow to make that time often, and to let that be the pleasure <i>and</i> the reward.&#8221; Peter Geye, Bestselling Author of <em>The Lighthouse Road</em>.</p>
<p>“I’m hoping to write more short stories in the New Year, and perhaps even publish some of them in a few journals and magazines. But good stories are hard to write, and that short story market is difficult to crack.” ~Wiley Cash, New York Times Bestselling Author of <em>A Land More Kind Than Home</em></p>
<p>“Every day since July 1, I have set a timer for 30 minutes. I write during this time, and on less-chaotic days, the 30 minutes extends into longer sessions. My goal is to continue my streak (I haven&#8217;t missed a day, yay), and produce my version of a readable draft by June 1.” ~Maryanne O’Hara, Bestselling Author of <em>Cascade</em></p>
<p>“With my next deadline looming, my very first goal is to finish my current novel, THE EDGE OF LOST. (If my editor is reading this, I swear I&#8217;m almost done!) Soon after, I&#8217;ll be diving into promo plans leading up to its November release while also researching and brainstorming for the next book &#8212; because who really needs sleep, right?  :)” ~Kristina McMorris, Bestselling Author of <em>The Pieces We Keep</em></p>
<p>“My 2015 goal is to finish a draft, maybe two, of my new novel, The Gypsy Moth Summer. Another goal of mine is to have a more complex story line in this next novel, and so I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about order of information, what info needs to be revealed (or withheld) from the reader, and when is the best time to reveal. I’d also like to do this without eating too many donuts, which helped fuel late night writing when I was working on my first novel, Cutting Teeth.” ~Julia Fierro, Author of <em>Cutting Teeth</em></p>
<p>“My goal for 2015: Basically I&#8217;m just going to walk the earth. You know&#8230; like Kane in Kung fu: walk from place to place, meet people, get in adventures. Visit Harlan Ellison. And write more short stories.” ~Jamie Ford, NY Times Bestselling Author of <em>Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet</em></p></blockquote>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Don Maass, How Good Manuscripts Go Wrong</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What welcomes us into a story?</strong></p>
<p>For Don, it’s engagement with the protagonist that matters the most.</p>
<p>This is usually the first way that good manuscripts go wrong.</p>
<p>Think about your protagonist. There are three different kinds:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Everyman or everywoman.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>People like you and me. Extraordinary things may happen to them in the course of the story, but their circumstances otherwise are regular.</p>
<p>Work out a way in which the reader can experience this quality of this character on page one.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><em>Genuine Hero or Heroine.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Characters whose live or occupation put them in the way of danger or cause them to do extraordinary things.</p>
<p>Write down one way in which this character is perfectly ordinary, regular and human, just like everybody else. Work out a way in which the reader can see this quality right on page one.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><em>Dark Characters.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Suffering wounded, carrying a burden. Inhuman or unhuman in some way. If your genre begins with “para” you’re probably working with a dark character.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="500"><p>When dark characters work, there is something compelling in their suffering&#8211;there is hope&#8211;from the start of the novel. <a href="https://twitter.com/DonMaass">@DonMaass</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WUUnCon?src=hash">#WUUnCon</a></p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Middles</strong></p>
<p>Need to give the reader ongoing reasons to care for the character, things he experiences all the way through. What is one thing your main character can do that no one else can?</p>
<p>What unique ability does this protagonist have that no one else has?</p>
<p>What’s one benefit of having this ability or gift? What’s one thing it makes possible that others might not get?</p>
<p>This gift also has a cost. What is the cost?</p>
<p>Write down a point in the story when the character’s gift will backfire.</p>
<p>Most manuscripts don’t need less happening, they need more happening. You don’t want the character’s gift failing all over the place, maybe only once, but you want lots happening through the middle of the book to avoid losing steam. Most middles are malnourished. Tension, events, relationships, theme—don’t worry about overpacking your story. What feels overdone to you is probably just about enough to keep the audience going.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>What is one thing that happens in the story, one provocative thing, that can cause your character to lose it?</p>
<p>What is the moment when your protagonist can rise above what is happening? When he finds an inner serenity, an inner perspective? When there’s a provocation, a temptation that’s irresistible, but your protagonist turns the other cheek, takes a step back? Decides to be patient. When is your character tested and passes that test? Exceed expectations, be their best selves, be the person that we all would like to be.</p>
<p>All of these are tools to reinforce the connections that readers feel to this protagonist.</p>

<p><strong>Things to Ignore in Criticism</strong></p>
<p>The oldest reason to ignore a review: emotional testimonial. “I loved it.” “I threw it across the room.”</p>
<p>What’s even less important in your book review: people instructing the consumer. “Don’t read this book.” “If you don’t read another book this year, read this one.”</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations in Handling Reviews</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Scour them for specificity.</li>
<li>Ignore emotional reactions (positive or negative)</li>
<li>Duck “buy” or “don’t buy” messages</li>
<li>Pay as little attention to the symbolic ratings (stars) as possible</li>
<li>Watch for consistent reviewers, readers who turn up to review more than one of your books (they’re good ones to pay attention to)</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember that a major portion of the review coverage you get today—maybe the majority of it—is not for you. It’s for the customer.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Heather Webb/Catherine McKenzie, Hating on the Draft</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Beginnings</strong></p>
<p>It needs to grip you on some visceral, emotional level, or you’re not going to have enough fuel to get through the work of the writing.</p>
<p>The beginning doesn’t need to be perfect to move on.</p>
<p>Get your butt in the chair, set a schedule, set goals. That’s how you get a draft done.</p>
<p>Tip for setting goals: Block off times. If you have to get your story done by writing only 30 minutes a day, whatever it is, put it in your schedule as if it’s an appointment. Set a tough schedule for yourself, and don’t let yourself get around it.</p>

<p><strong>Self-Editing Techniques</strong></p>
<p>Lots of people are in critique groups; you have to figure that out for yourself—do you need a complete draft before you let someone else in?</p>
<p>You also need to learn to look at your own work. Reading aloud can help, or having someone else read it.</p>
<p>Another suggestion is editing your chapters out of order. It’s like a television show—there’s a season arc, but each episode needs a beginning, middle and end. Those are chapters.</p>
<p>Edit in layers. First, mostly for dialogue. Then voice, and then thinking about one issue in the story, one theme, and strengthening it.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote"><p>Another suggestion is editing your chapters out of order. It’s like a television show—there’s a season arc, but each episode needs a beginning, middle and end. Those are chapters.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Drastic measures: when to hire an outside editor</strong>.</p>
<p>Audition the editor. One who’s not good might change your voice; you don’t want that. You need someone who can step into your voice and work within it. Get the smallest package at first, 50 pages or whatever it is, to make sure this person “gets” you.</p>
<p>Even when you’re traditionally published and have an editor, you still might sometimes hire an outside editor before submitting.</p>
<p><strong>How do I “Know” I have a Good Product to Begin With?</strong></p>
<p>Reading all the time, comparing your work, is important. It gives you a sense of what will sell. You know what you want to write, now you have to figure out how you can make it fit into the marketplace… spend an hour in your section at a bookstore, see how they set up the first chapters, look at the types of titles, the covers, the types of stories. Who publishes what. Envisioning your product in the marketplace is important, and especially now, since the market is flooded.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Don Maass,  21<sup>st</sup> Century Fiction</strong></h3>
<div id="attachment_34911" style="width: 535px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://twitter.com/MLConklin/status/530793829776232448"><img class="wp-image-34911 size-large" src="http://writerunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Mel-final-525x372.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="372" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">picture by Melanie Conklin</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 21st Century, literary and commercial intents are converging. Novels that combine great story and beautiful writing can become top best sellers (in trade paperback) for one to two years or longer. (By contrast, hardcover thrillers hit the list for only a few weeks.) Commercial storytellers have techniques to benefit literary writers, and literary writers have tools useful to commercial types.</p>
<p>To grow this way, literary writers must stop thinking of “plot” as a four-letter word and embrace strong story events. Conversely, commercial storytellers must stop thinking of “beautiful writing” as useless pretty imagery and recognize that it is actually a collection of many things that any writer can do without blushing.</p>

<p>It starts with writing personally, which in turn leads to methods of constructing protagonists’ inner journeys: their arc of change and transformation. These can be built in many ways. Creating step-by-step inner conflict is one. Another is to build in secrets, shame and a need for healing. (This requires deep backstory work.)</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="500"><p>&quot;A story is universal because of its specifics. Nobody does anything in general.&quot;&#8211;<a href="https://twitter.com/DonMaass">@donmaass</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WUUnCon?src=hash">#WUUnCon</a></p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>An inner journey can be customized, too, out of long-term reversals; say, a difficult climactic task, a firm conviction about the world or self, and so on. Set up your protagonist, test his articles of faith, then reverse (or refine) them. The trick is not to make it a simple moment of realization at the novel’s end, but rather an ongoing, novel-length struggle.</p>
<p>Strong events can be made by identifying the main (outwardly visible) problem and making it worse, worse, worse…and finally so bad that your protagonist actually fails. Authors of character-driven stories can pause at any point of inner awareness or turning and externalize it. Put duct tape over your protagonist’s mouth, shut off the interior monologue feed, and make your protagonist visibly show us what’s going on inside.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Beautiful writing is not only pretty imagery but also associative devices such as parallels, reversals, and symbols that suggest and amplify the story’s meaning. Detailing a story’s social classes and era also gives stories larger significance.</p>
<p>Every author starts in a box built of expectations. To the extent you stay in that box, your story’s impact will be low, because what we read will be what we expect to read. Break out of the box and your stories can have greater impact and maybe do it all. All you need are the right tools.</p>
<p><strong>We hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed the recap!</strong></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Story and Plot<br />
<em>with Don Maass, Lisa Cron, and Brunonia Barry</em></strong></h3>
<div id="attachment_34905" style="width: 535px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://twitter.com/MLConklin/status/530003285164707840"><img class="wp-image-34905 size-large" src="http://writerunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Plot-and-Story-525x692.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="692" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Drawing by Melanie Conklin</p></div>
<p><strong>Don:</strong> In the world of writing, we tend to feel that story is plot. They’re two different things.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> Story is how what happens affects someone in pursuit of a difficult goal and how they change as a result. The “how what happens” part is the plot. The story is about how it affects the protagonist. Everything in the plot gets its meaning and emotional weight in terms of its impact on the protagonist. Story is internal, not external.</p>
<p><strong>Don:</strong> It doesn’t matter what the plot is. (His “radical” statement.)</p>
<p>What matters is that there’s a sense of meaning, a sense of import and emotional connection to the reader. The events of the book connect with what’s happening inside the character.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> You can’t write forward and get to know the character as you write. You don’t know how they will react to things. But if you do the character work first, it comes into the story.</p>
<p><strong>Don:</strong> One way to look at plot is cause and effect. Consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Don:</strong> Put a line at the beginning on the scene that states the need in the scene, the inner drive. When the scene is done, when it’s infused, go back and delete that line. You shouldn’t need it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Brunonia:</strong> I always tell the story from all different points of view to find what the story will become. What does the character want, and what’s keeping them from getting it? What do they fear more than anything? That has to be everywhere. It’s a reminder at the beginning of each chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Don:</strong> If you have an idea of what needs to happen scene by scene, you can figure out how to connect that up and make it count for the internal and external journeys.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> A problem is that sometimes writers will write things in general. Nobody ever does things in general. We do them in <em>specific situations</em>. But the language for talking about emotions tends to be general. Make the experiences in the novel as specific as possible, and readers will plug their own emotions and specific experiences into it. Make them general, and no one will connect.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><strong>Don:</strong> Simple technique for getting story promise in and emotional connection: What is the true start of your story? Not when the inciting incident happens, but when your main character knows with certainty that things are changing. Something is changing and it’s not going to change back to where it was.</p>
<p><strong>Don:</strong> The true ending moment of the story is when your protagonist knows with certainty that they’ve walked into a new world. Everything is different now, and we’ll never go back to where we were.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Therese Walsh, Velveteen Characters </strong></h3>
<p><em>Both successes and failures are full of value. There is no wasted experience.</em></p>
<p>It’s not *all* about the planning.</p>
<p>If you’re writing characters you don’t care about, stop.</p>
<p>Cast fear aside. It can inhibit Real.</p>
<p>What is your character afraid of? How can you make that a wild card in your story to make that character less predictable, more complex, surprising both your readers and even the character?</p>
<p>Characters held too close may never evolve, but they may become Real when you set them free.</p>
<p>Don’t presume to understand your characters fully at first imagining.</p>
<p>Backstory is everything. It’s about understanding where our characters come from, what has made them into the people they are when we begin the story, and it’s about knowing who they need to become by the end of the journey.</p>
<p>These people ARE the reason you write, aren’t they? Your desperation to tell their story well — your dedication to that end — is what will make them Real.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>John Vorhaus, Squeezing Out the Stupid</strong></h3>
<p><strong>You have the right to self-edit</strong>. You have the artistic right to take compete control of every aspect of your work. You have the choice to treat a novel as a work of art, as opposed to a work of writing.</p>
<p>Squeezing out the stupid starts with the determination to make the best piece of art we can—in terms of the work, not the ego.</p>

<p>So how do you know when it’s done? The question isn’t “Have I told the best possible version of the story.” It’s “Have I told a version of the story that works?”</p>
<p>A pivot in storytelling is a new piece of information that triggers a change in emotional state.</p>
<p>Something that’s happening or an emotional reaction to what’s happened: If it’s not one of those two things, it deserves close scrutiny.</p>

<p>Give the reader the minimal amount of information to describe the picture he’s seeing in his own head.</p>
<p>Self-awareness will allow you to bring clarity to your writing problems, and will help you get out of the mess. Need to think about value judgments—where the work is. Not whether the work is good or bad.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Meg Rosoff, Where Story Comes From</strong></h3>
<p>Out of the seven billion+ human beings on this planet, there is no other <em>you</em>. You are unique. The people you meet, the paths you take, the obstacles you overcome, the decisions you make&#8211;they all combine to make an individual that is uniquely you. Therefore, it only makes sense that what&#8217;s in your head is unique, too. And there is a <em>Wilderness</em> in there.</p>
<p>That Wilderness is your <strong>unconscious.</strong> Think of it that way. All the interactions you&#8217;ve ever experienced in your life are stored there, whether you realize it or not, and tapping into them is like discovering new medicinal plants in the Amazon Rainforest. These dormant thoughts, as with healing balms, will improve the condition&#8211;any diseased state&#8211;of your writing and make it resonate.</p>
<p>So how do we do that?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Quiet yourself. </strong>Get comfortable with being alone. There is motion (and emotion) in stillness. Do not berate yourself if this is difficult at first; it takes practice to be quiet, alone, and to simply <em>be still.</em></li>
<li><strong>Hold your nerve. </strong>Sometimes you have to wait (and possibly go through draft after draft after draft) for the story to reveal itself. It <em>will</em> reveal itself. Again, practice stillness when blocked.</li>
<li><strong>Practice &#8220;Throughness,&#8221; too.</strong> Follow your thoughts through to harvest your Wilderness. Throughness allows for flow of energy. Throughness is supple and elastic; it is being connected and unblocked. [See session notes for Meg&#8217;s &#8220;Throughness,&#8221; <a href="http://writerunboxed.com/2014/12/29/writer-unboxed-un-conference-wrap-up-part-1/">HERE</a>.]</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Follow the story; </strong>do not lead the story. Leading the story is not connecting to your unconscious, but instead, is permitting the conscious mind to take over.</li>
<li><strong>We do not see things as they are,</strong>we see things as <em>we</em> are. Our perceptions of the events in the world are formed from our various lifetime experiences. No two people view the same happening in the same, exact way. Remember: Uniqueness.</li>
<li><strong>Stop yourself and assess the situation.</strong>Question why you&#8217;re thinking what you&#8217;re thinking. What beliefs formed this train of thought? How does it play into your story? Are you leading or following?</li>
</ul>
<p>And last,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pay attention to your dreams.</strong>Your dreams are the pathways through the Wilderness. They are fantastical, nonsensical, and inexplicable at times, but <em>take heed.</em> Look to the right. Note it. Look to the left. Note it. In the seemingly jumbled array, your conscious mind will begin to make sense of it all. <em>The quality of your unconscious mind and the ability to channel it to your conscious mind will show in your writing.</em></li>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Don Maass, Microtension</strong></h3>
<p>If you are compulsively reading every word of a novel, even one of a genre you don’t like written in a style you loathe, it is because the author is creating a constant mild apprehension in you that forces you to read every next thing on every page. It’s a line-by-line micro-tension that is different from plot conflict and scene goals. It works like this:</p>
<p><strong>In dialogue</strong>: Tension arises in the mind of the reader when there is tension between characters.</p>
<p><strong>In action</strong>: Tension is provoked in the reader not because of the action itself but because what is felt inside the POV character, especially when that inner state is fresh and surprising.</p>
<p><strong>In exposition (internal monologue)</strong>: Tension arises when emotions are in conflict and ideas are at war. Rehashing worries that are already obvious and inherent in the situation, though, doesn’t work. What’s going on inside must be unexpected.</p>
<p>With micro-tension you can break any rule. You can make anything on the page work. It’s the secret that explains how some writers “get away” with stuff you don’t and why best sellers sell big when very similar novelists do not.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="500"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wuuncon?src=hash">#wuuncon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DonMaass">@DonMaass</a> is suggesting the writers in the session use a page-number randomizer to spot incremental needs for tension.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Don Maass, Secondary Characters</strong></h3>
<p>Middles sag. Tightening is only part of it. </p>
<div class="simplePullQuote"><p>What does he want? How does she see the main problem differently from the protagonist? When does this SC most love, and later least understand, your protagonist? What gift or self-sacrifice can this SC make? What is the worst way and time for this SC to betray your protagonist? What secret history do they share? How does each see the other differently at the end?</p>
</div>
<p>Most middles need more: more events, more substance, more to chew on. Secondary characters can generate a lot of those events and substance. Give them agency, which is to say their own needs and wants, time to act, and room to change.</p>
<p>Helpful questions for a secondary character (SC): What does he want? How does she see the main problem differently from the protagonist? When does this SC most love, and later least understand, your protagonist? What gift or self-sacrifice can this SC make? What is the worst way and time for this SC to betray your protagonist? What secret history do they share? How does each see the other differently at the end? Work backward to make the starting point of their relationship an article of faith. (It’s going to change!)</p>
