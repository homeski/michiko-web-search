				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I hope everyone is enjoying the holidays!</p>
<p>Just because we're nearing the end of the year, it doesn't mean you're out of time to bring in new freelance work. Whether you're looking to line-up last minute gigs or trying to schedule January's billable hours, there are plenty of things you can do to market your freelance writing services before year's end.</p>
<p>Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Email clients you've worked with over the year to thank them for their business. Ask if they have any upcoming projects you can assist with.</li>
<li>When contacting clients, encourage them to order (and pay) quickly to work their next project into the current year's budget. Even clients who usually pay on completion will sometimes pre-pay this time of year so they can deduct the business expense on this year's taxes.</li>
<li>Send a free bonus of some sort to prospects or past clients (like a short report). Not only does it bring their attention to you right now, but it makes you stand out among competing freelancers. Most they work with probably don't do this for them.</li>
<li>Update your rates on your professional website if you've decided to increase (or even decrease) your rates in the New Year.</li>
<li>Release a premium guide or report that promises to help prospects improve their businesses in the New Year. Make sure you close the guide by mentioning your freelance writing services. For example, one of my most successful guides was one on how to write a press release and distribute it online. By teaching prospects some of what you do, you encourage them to try it for themselves. That's when many <em>really </em>start to appreciate the value of hiring a pro.</li>
</ol>
<p>Kick off 2015 already on the minds of your prospects by making the most of the time you have left this year.</p>
<p>Now tell me -- what marketing do <em>you </em>still have planned this year? How do you plan to kick off the New Year?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you've been blogging with WordPress for a while, you probably know that WordPress saves several revisions of your posts as you create or edit them. These revision backups are saved when you save drafts or update live posts.</p>
<p>WordPress revisions can come in handy if you made changes you aren't happy with or if you accidentally delete something from a post draft. But they also increase the size of your database, and over time they can cause slow-downs. That's because they're essentially saved as separate posts in your database. So even if you only have a couple hundred live posts on your blog, you could have thousands of "posts" in your database.</p>
<p>You can make tweaks to your wp-config file to limit the number revisions WordPress will save. But not everyone is comfortable making changes to that file, and sometimes you'll want even more control. That's where a plugin can come in handy.</p>
<h2>The WordPress Revision Control Plugin</h2>
<p>I generally use a plugin called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/revision-control/">WordPress Revision Control</a> on high-post-count blogs to control which revisions are saved. Here are some of the things it allows you to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a default number of revisions to save on all posts and pages. You can set different defaults for different custom post types.</li>
<li>Manually override that default on specific posts or pages.</li>
<li>Delete individual revisions from the post edit screen (this isn't possible with the default WordPress behavior).</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>Bonus Tip: </strong>If you've saved your draft or published a post, but you don't see a list of revisions on the post edit screen, click the "screen options" link near the top of the page. Then make sure "post revisions" is checked.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another plugin I sometimes use to manage revisions, and one I've talked about here before, is <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/is-your-wordpress-database-too-large-thin-out-revisions/">Thin Out Revisions</a>. This plugin is helpful if you already have a lot of revisions saved in your database and you want to mass-delete them. You can even schedule revision deletions to happen automatically at set time intervals.</p>
<p>How do <em>you </em>currently manage WordPress post revisions, if at all?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today marks not only my last working day of the year, but also the last All Indie Writers Podcast episode of 2014. <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/podcast/5/">Episode 5</a> picks up where episode 4 left off, with more tips on keeping your blog active even while you take a holiday.</p>
<p>In this episode I share tips on not only keeping your blog fresh with new content while you take time off, but also how you might manage comments during a break. Then I tackle a question from a writer wondering if freelance copywriting is still a viable career option (given that many clients now want do-it-all service providers). And I share some resources for indie authors. [<a href="http://allindiewriters.com/podcast/5/">Read the show notes.</a>]
<p>While I'll be taking a break of my own over the next couple of weeks, you'll still find fresh content posted here at least twice per week until I return on January 5th.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays!</p>

While this post was originally written for a target audience of PR professionals and business owners, the material is equally valuable to bloggers.</em></p>
<p><em>This version of the post has been slightly edited to remove dated links and references. If you missed the first half of this post series, check out <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/bloggers-vs-journalists-with-pro-blogger-darren-rowse/">Bloggers vs. Journalists: With Pro Blogger, Darren Rowse</a>.</em></p>
<p>--</p>
<p>As promised, here is the second half of my recent interview with pro blogger <a href="http://problogger.net">Darren Rowse</a>, on targeting bloggers and pitching bloggers with your stories or those of your clients.</p>
<h2>The Case for Targeting Bloggers</h2>
<p>No matter where you fall in the <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/bloggers-vs-journalists-with-pro-blogger-darren-rowse/">bloggers vs journalists debate</a>, Darren thinks that public relations people should avoid snubbing bloggers:</p>
<blockquote><p>"One big benefit of bloggers is that they have an ability to build real trust with readers. I'm not doubting that this can happen with journalists too but blogs can be very personal and the relationship between blogger and reader can be quite deep."</p></blockquote>
<p>I have to agree with him. Bloggers do have the ability to build trust with readers on a deeper level than can be done in some other outlets - it all comes down to that interactive conversation we love so much in PR. I've even witnessed this on one of my other blogs specifically - seeing how a more personal approach built trust, increased interaction, increased backlinks and referrals to the blog, and even increased revenue. Darren's <a href="http://problogger.net">ProBlogger</a> is one of the most trusted resources in the blogging community.</p>
<blockquote><p>"I know that after writing daily content for three years that some of my longer term readers feel like they know me. They've benefited from my advice for years, they've seen me develop and experiment in my field of expertise, they've also seen some of the personal things that I talk about from my life... they trust me. As a result when I make a recommendation or suggestion they're more than likely to act on that. This is a powerful thing and something that companies are obviously interested to tap into."</p></blockquote>
<p>And tap into trusted blogs they do - through advertising and pushing affiliate programs on bloggers they know can reach their target market to pitching stories to bloggers in the hopes of getting exposure with their loyal and targeted audience.</p>
<h2>Choosing Blogs to Target</h2>
<p>If you intend to target bloggers for your own company or on behalf of clients with your press releases or pitches, it's important to focus on bloggers that are reaching your target audience effectively, and those bloggers who have developed trust, as Darren mentioned, with that audience.</p>
<p>Darren and I disagree a bit on targeting bloggers - mostly in how to build the relationships (what's needed, what's not, etc.). At the same time, he makes some excellent points and recommendations of tools to use to get at least a vague idea of which bloggers can influence your audience:</p>
<blockquote><p>"There are a number of things that I'd suggest:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use tools like Technorati or Google's Blog search to find what blogs are covering the topic you're interested in. You can set up 'alerts' or 'watch lists' for certain keywords to be notified what's going on in an industry. After a while you'll see the same blogs coming up again and again which is at least an indication that they are 'on topic'.</li>
<li>Track with the blog for a few days or weeks before approaching them. See what and how they cover stories. Watch how many comments they get and what tone the comments are (you can learn a lot about a blogger by what goes on in their comments section). Pay particular attention to the 'voice' that they use to write posts (if they're an angry and controversial blogger they may or may not be the best vehicle to target.</li>
<li>Watch what others say about the blog. Use a tool like technorati to watch what other bloggers are linking up and for what reason they're talking about the blog. You'll quickly get an idea as to whether the blogger is trusted, influential and a credible source of information.</li>
<li>Use tools like Alexa or Compete to get an idea of traffic. They won't give you actual numbers but when you compare blogs using these tools you get an idea of how they rank in general terms.</li>
<li>Test the waters with a few comments of your own on their blog. Don't pitch them or do a PR spin - but leave a valuable and useful comment and see how it's received."</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>While I don't agree that you need to be testing the waters with comments and such for every blog you may want to target, I think the real key here is that you need to take the time to know what stories a blogger may or may not be interested in. More importantly perhaps, you need to let the blogger <em>know</em> why they've been targeted - let them know what related pieces you've read, etc. instead of simply assuming they'll know why you're pitching them. Darren sums it up nicely:</p>
<blockquote><p>"My advice to PR people is to travel with a blogger over time, build relationships, resource them, help them improve their blog, only 'pitch' relevant stories, tailor those pitches as much as possible to the blogger's audience and never manipulate bloggers (or be perceived to)."</p></blockquote>
<h2>Pitching Your Story to Bloggers</h2>
<p>After you've familiarized yourself with bloggers that can reach your audience, you need to find a way to pitch them without alienating them. Darren has written a <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/10/30/how-to-pitch-to-bloggers-21-tips/">21-point series of tips on how to pitch bloggers</a> (covering not only story pitches, but those for link recommendations and exchanges, interview requests, guest posts, and more).</p>
<p>His thoughts on pitching press releases directly interested me (he flat out suggests that you not do it):</p>
<blockquote><p>"I must have hit ‘delete’ on thousands of press releases over the last few years. While I do occasionally use them - it is generally only when they are right on target for my niche and quite often when I go searching for them. I’d much rather be pitched a story idea that is tailored to my blog. This need not be long or detailed (in fact it’s best if it’s not) but if someone shoots me an email that says ‘here’s a story you might be interested in and here’s why it’s relevant to your blog’s readers’ I’m much more likely to read it. If you do have a press release it might be more effective to not send it - but to give a link to where it is hosted online so that if the blogger wants to refer to it (and link to it) they can."</p></blockquote>
<p>On this point, I disagree a little bit. I think you should absolutely not hesitate to send news releases to bloggers. My experience specializing in online PR, working as a blogger on quite a few blogs myself, and working in larger networks where I was exposed to hundreds of online writers / bloggers tells me that many bloggers (including respected niche experts with large trusted followings) <em>do</em> in fact want to receive your press releases. However, I can understand that for a blogger of Darren's popularity, it might get overwhelming at times, so I don't blame him for feeling the way he does (I know other "big" bloggers who feel similarly). At the same time though, other large blogs (<a href="http://mashable.com/submit/">Mashable</a> comes to mind) actively <em>solicit</em> news release submissions.</p>
<p>I think the thing you need to focus on is your targeting (which is something I've said repeatedly in the past, and something I'll keep saying indefinitely into the future). While you may not have to follow specific bloggers for a long time to get a feel for them, you should absolutely be checking to see if they have specific pitching policies, requests, or even flat-out refusals before sending off a release. If they make it clear they don't want your releases, you're not helping yourself by sending them.</p>
<p>I think Darren did hit on an important point when he mentioned sending a short pitch email suggesting a story idea and why that idea would be relevant to the blogger's audience. Where we differ is that I look at that brief, more personalized email as an <em>addition</em> to the press release and not a substitute.</p>
<p>Working with a lot of Web-based clients targeting bloggers over the last couple of years, here's the course of action that I've found most effective:</p>
<ol>
<li>Target the bloggers, and create a list of the ones most relevant to your news story (you can use the tools and tips Darren offered).</li>
<li>Look around the blog for any mention of a pitching policy (the sidebar or contact page is where you'll often find it). If the blogger doesn't accept pitches, scratch them from your list. If they do, see if they mention any preferences for how to receive them (their own online form, via email, etc.). In most cases I end up pitching via email.</li>
<li>From that targeted list, search for specific blog posts related to your news story in some way. Read them thoroughly. Observe the interaction with readers in the comments. Get a good feel for how the individual bloggers cover topics like that you're planning to pitch (their attitude, tone, etc. - if they tend to be negative about the subject matter, you're not doing yourself any favors - for example, if someone reads Naked PR they should know better than to pitch me with a story about a new social network, Facebook app, etc.).</li>
<li>Write a short email (similar to what Darren mentioned). It should be tailored to each blogger individually... you can comment on one of the posts you read while evaluating the blog, something about their approach, etc. Let them know that you're not simply sending a random story idea, but instead that you did take the time to research their blog, audience, and interests. This kind of pitching even works on me personally - I get a lot of pitches for two of my blogs. If it's nothing but a release, I trash it. If it's something tailored to me, I consider it (which just led to me publishing a guest post and agreeing to partner in a contest very recently on another blog of mine). You don't have to spend a lot of time stroking the ego of the blogger you're emailing. Just show them you actually know something about them.</li>
<li>Paste your press release at the end of the actual email. It has always proven far more effective for me and my clients than simply linking to the release online as Darren mentioned. At the same time, there's nothing wrong with including a link <em>additionally </em>(preferably to a version hosted on your site or your client's site to take advantage of more direct linking)<em>.</em> This works better for a simple reason... as easy as it is to click a link, it's still often a struggle to get people to do it (online advertisers have struggled with this issue for quite some time). Remember, it's just as easy for the recipient to click once to close your email. Put the information in front of their face. If they want it, they'll read it. If they don't, it's extremely easy to ignore, and just focus on the personal pitch above - I suggest leaving a bit of space between the two to avoid it looking like one huge continuous email message, and just allude to the press release in the short message.</li>
</ol>
<p>So tell me... what pitching policies do <em>you</em> follow when targeting bloggers (or are you even targeting bloggers)? Have you experimented? What's been most effective?  Are there any other specific tools you use to help you identify bloggers that may be worth targeting, following, or building relationships with?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New Year will be here before you know it, and there's no time like the present to prepare for it. Recently I shared <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/writing-business-december/">three things to do this December</a> to close out the current year. For this week's quick tips, let's expand upon that with some easy things you can do now that will have you ready to hit the ground running after the holidays, getting your New Year off to a successful start.</p>
<p>Here are ten super-simple things you can do ahead of time to kick 2015 off right:</p>
<ol>
<li>Update your client files (archiving things you won't need any time soon, updating contact info, or creating new files for the New Year).</li>
<li>Clean and organize your office, desk, or other work space. Come into a fresh environment on January 2nd (or whenever you come back to work after the holiday).</li>
<li>Update (or create) your editorial calendar if you run a blog.</li>
<li>Line up January's freelance projects if you haven't already (or further out if you can).</li>
<li>Map out a writing, editing, and publishing schedule for your next book or e-book.</li>
<li>Clean up your computer's filing system.</li>
<li>Make any business purchases you want the tax deduction for this year (it's a good time to purchase year-long services that can help you grow your business for example).</li>
<li>Download and review any data that can help you make better decisions for January (blog traffic, conversion numbers, email subscribers, etc.).</li>
<li>Set new goals as appropriate and update both your long-term plans and your regular to-do lists so you can jump right in after the holiday.</li>
<li>Read a new book that can help you grow your writing business in the New Year.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm sure there are plenty of other ideas I'm missing here, so now it's your turn. Tell me what you're doing between now and January 1st, and how it's going to prepare you for a more successful new year.</p>

<p>Should companies and PR professionals treat bloggers as journalists? Are bloggers entitled to the same perks as journalists, and can they handle the same responsibilities? For that matter, are bloggers a <em>threat</em> to more traditional journalists?</p>
<p>During a re-launch of the now-retired Naked PR blog, I wanted dive into these issues. So I discussed that, and more, with popular pro blogger, <a title="Darren Rowse" href="http://problogger.net">Darren Rowse</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from his reputation as the six figure blogger behind <a href="http://problogger.net">ProBlogger</a> and <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School</a>, Darren co-authored the book <em><a href="http://probloggerbook.com/">ProBlogger: Secrets to Blogging Your Way to a Six-Figure Income</a></em> with <a href="http://chrisg.com">Chris Garrett</a>. Much like his advice on ProBlogger.net, the book promises to be nothing of a get-rich-quick guide for bloggers, but instead "a practical guide to creating and marketing a blog."</p>
<p>Visit the book link above to order your copy, or sign up for the newsletter to preview a free chapter. In all honesty (since we all know I don't say nice things just to kiss ass around here), I've followed both of the authors' blogs in the past, and the ProBlogger book is one of few books on my must-read list at the moment. <em>(Update: While this was originally written in 2008, this is still a great book for beginner bloggers to have in their arsenals.)</em></p>
<p>Now, well-deserved plug aside, let's get down to business:</p>
<h2>Should (or Can) Bloggers be Treated as Journalists?</h2>
<p>This is a subject I'm a bit torn on. Obviously, being that journalists can choose to get into blogging, bloggers <em>can</em> be journalists without a doubt. It's the "should" part of the question that I'm less sure about (being a blogger who has covered news issues for some blogs in the past, while at the same time taking the PR perspective).</p>
<p>I look at it this way: For me, as a PR professional, to treat a blogger along the lines of a more traditional journalist, they have to earn that "right" individually. I don't automatically consider them worth pitches, access to materials, etc. They have to first demonstrate through their blogging that they're not only able to reach their target audience, but be able to do that in a responsible manner when they're reporting news and industry issues. I think a lot of bloggers fall short, especially with the latter.</p>
<p>Darren is one of the most popular bloggers out there, yet he doesn't consider himself a journalist. Instead he sees a distinction, saying "in my mind at least a journalist has some level of training in the reporting of news and current events." However, he does see a growing overlap between blogging and journalism, saying that they sometimes share aims in their work and that "in effect [bloggers and journalists are] often competing for the same readers."</p>
<p>That's a point I have to agree with, and why I don't shy away completely from building relationships with bloggers (in a PR capacity -- note, I am now a full-time writer and professional blogger myself, only occasionally working as a PR consultant for some of my older clients). They often have a different kind of connection with their readers, and can reach a similar audience in a different way than more traditional journalists can.</p>
<p>I really think you have to make individual judgment calls when deciding how to interact with bloggers, how far you'll go to get coverage on blogs versus other outlets, etc. How do <em>you</em> feel about it?</p>
<h2><!--adsense-->Do Bloggers Really <em>Want</em> to be Treated as Journalists?</h2>
<p>Here's where Darren and I disagree a little bit. He doesn't <em>want</em> the title of "journalist," and thinks that "many [bloggers] would probably see the title as more of a hindrance, or as old-fashioned." What I've witnessed over the last few years is quite different.</p>
<p>Darren noted that "a year or two ago, the only thing [he] felt [he] was at a disadvantage of was getting press passes at events or conferences." He went on to explain that he no longer has that problem. I'd imagine not in his case. As I mentioned, he's one of the more well-known bloggers, whose blog can lead to quite a bit of exposure. Would <em>you</em> refuse press passes or materials that could have you mentioned at ProBlogger? If your business would benefit from reaching his particular audience, I highly doubt that.</p>
<p>I think "smaller" bloggers still see things quite a bit differently. Perhaps they're not looking for the <em>title,</em> but I do think many want the "perks." Here's why:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was previously the Technology Editor for a large content network (you can read a little bit about this <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/residual-income/">here</a>). As such, I had to recruit writers (who also handled blogging). Being treated as a member of the media was a huge selling point in attracting qualified writers, and frankly, it worked. (On top of that, they were never short of excited when they <em>did</em> receive press passes, advanced news, etc.)</li>
<li>I published a post about this issue previously, after I came across criticism of PRweb's editorial policies, saying they should be more casual and relaxed just because it's what bloggers want - I'd say that shows a certain sense of entitlement on the blogger side. Again, maybe not a longing for the title of journalist, but definitely a longing to be treated similarly (if not <em>better</em> based on their standards of what a news release should be for their needs).</li>
<li>I'm a moderator on a popular webmaster forum, frequented by many bloggers. (<em>Update: I quit serving as a moderator there in 2010.)</em> So I posed this question there yesterday. Of the discussion so far, I'm definitely getting the vibe that bloggers want the perks of journalists - from one blogger saying they could have "provided better coverage of [a certain] global event than was being done by most news organizations," to another blogger being a bit more blunt, saying "Of course [bloggers] should be entitled to all those things...." ("All those things" being news access, event passes, review copies, etc.) Others fell more in line with what I've already said - that bloggers can essentially be treated as journalists if they adhere to the same standards.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I do think a lot of bloggers would happily take the perks of being a journalist. So then the question becomes "would most actually be willing to take on the <em>responsibilities</em> that go along with that?" That I really doubt. But what do <em>you</em> think, either from the perspective of a PR professional, journalist, or blogger yourself?</p>
<h2>Are Bloggers a <em>Threat</em> to Traditional Journalists?</h2>
<p>Personally, I'd be more worried about journalists having the potential to wipe out smaller bloggers. It's tough enough to break into blogging if you haven't already built at least a little bit of a name for yourself. Sometimes your blog is what makes you known, but I think if we suddenly had a huge surge of professional journalists jumping into blogging, it would be that much more difficult for new bloggers to build an audience -- at least those trying to compete over the same subject matter. Then again, there's something to be said for being independent and not tied to a corporate media source.</p>
<p>Darren doesn't see either blogging or journalism as a threat to the other. According to him, "what we're seeing is a more fuzzy division between the two with more and more journalists also blogging both personally and professionally, and with bloggers crossing over into journalism also."</p>
<p>He mentions that "we're also seeing more and more mainstream media outlets attempting to embrace different forms of 'new media' including blogging." He acknowledges that mainstream media overall may still be in a learning phase as far as figuring out how to effectively incorporate blogs into their networks, but that "we'll see more and more blurring of the line between the two" as more journalists cross into blogging territory.</p>
<p>Darren doesn't want to see either group feel threatened by the other, and instead points out that they may be able to not only coexist, but actually help each other - "Those trained in journalism could offer a lot to those of us who come from the blogging side of things. My hope is that the more these two world [<em>sic</em>] 'collide' the more we'll all learn and develop in our mediums."</p>
<p>I think that's a great way to look at things in theory. I wonder how true it will prove to be in practice though as we <em>do</em> see these worlds "collide" to a greater extent. Are bloggers going to start embracing more journalistic practices (more detailed research and fact-checking for example)? Will journalists getting into blogging feel forced to be more lax in these areas when competing with bloggers who can (and do) post news almost immediately in a constant race to break a story (not something unfamiliar to journalists - just perhaps in a faster-paced environment)? (<em>Update: As of 2014, I'm happy to say I've seen more of the former, with bloggers embracing longer features, more in-depth research, and improved interview skills.)</em></p>
<p>How do you see bloggers influencing journalists and journalists influencing bloggers in the future? Do you think the two groups will learn to welcome each other with open arms, or do you think there's plenty of bickering yet to come? Where do you see that line right now, and how much do you see it blurring, as Darren predicts, within the next few years?</p>
<p>Share your thoughts on this topic in the comments below. And check back on Wednesday for the follow-up post where Darren Rowse and I share some tips on targeting and pitching bloggers with your story ideas.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year is almost over, and that means it's time to evaluate progress and set goals for the New Year. So today I'd like to share an example with a follow-up from my previous progress check-in and also some new goals for my writing business in 2015.</p>
<h2>2014 Year-End Check-In</h2>
<p>This year was very good in some ways. But in others I didn't come close to meeting my goals. A lot of that was poor planning on my part. While I'm a bit of an organization junkie, my biggest issue was with my indie publishing projects -- mostly knocking out first drafts on shorter work. And the problem came in the planning.</p>
<p>While I have a five-year publishing plan in place, that plan was based on projects-per-quarter. What I should have done was map out a more specific schedule by the month, or even the week. That's changing, and I'm working on a plan like that for 2015's first quarter before I finish up work for this year (through the end of next week).</p>
<p>Here are some of the goals left from my <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/2014-writing-goals-3rd-quarter/">third quarter check-in</a> and what I did, and didn't, get finished:</p>
<h3>1. Limit client projects to two working days per week.</h3>
<p>I cut this back to three working days per week at the beginning of 2014 and planned to cut back to two days per week by the end of the year (planning to make the change on my website right before the first of the New Year).</p>
<p>I don't expect this to happen right away. That's a result of some new ongoing work I picked up recently. And I suspect pushing regulars into two working days per week would be a bit tight right now. If I or a client decide to cancel one of those regular gigs in the future, I'll likely take that opportunity to scale back my client-focused working days, but I'm not going to force it at the start of the year.</p>
<h3>2. Start posting to my business blog at least once per month.</h3>
<p>In my last check-in I mentioned wanting to pre-write posts so I couldn't let this slide. And that's exactly what I did. So I'm happy to say I'm on this schedule. And I intend to stick with pre-writing post batches on at least a quarterly basis to make sure I stay there.</p>
<h3>3. Post to my genealogy blog at least twice per month.</h3>
<p>I decided to change this to a monthly posting schedule, and like I did with my business blog, I pre-wrote content for the last quarter of 2014. Again, I intend to continue doing that into the new year with one post per month.</p>
<h3>4. Release one or two e-courses at All Indie Writers by year's end.</h3>
<p>This was an adjustment to my original goal of launching three this year. But as I said in my last update, one to two is more likely. And it's looking like it'll only be one. There are near constant updates to the new e-course platform, including some recent major ones. So I need to make sure they won't affect anything in the first free course's setup. Barring any problems with that, the first one will be scheduled for release either at the end of next week or it will come out while I'm on vacation later this month.</p>
<h3>5. Revise my first mystery novel.</h3>
<p>The revisions have become more of a full rewrite. They're coming along, but they won't be finished by the end of this month. I decided to re-outline the story from its first draft, this time using the Snowflake Method. So far it's helping me with the pacing, but there are still a few big problem areas I need to re-work.</p>
<h3>6. Release three more e-books this year.</h3>
<p>This didn't happen, though one more short one should be released here by the end of next week. There's a <em>slight </em>chance that two will be ready, but I'm not counting on it.</p>
<h3>7. Draft my first horror novel.</h3>
<p>While the first draft isn't finished, I did write a little over 50,000 words for this novel during NaNoWriMo this year. And I plan to pick it up again in January, with an estimated final word count of around 80,000 words.</p>
<h3>8. Launch the podcast and release the new design at All Indie Writers.</h3>
<p>Both of these goals were met.</p>
<p>I had also planned to spend more time on picture book manuscripts and my short stories and flash fiction. But I simply didn't have as much time for them as I'd hoped.</p>
<h2>2015 Writing and Publishing Goals</h2>
<p>I'm not going to go into as much depth as usual with next year's goals, but here's a summary for you with some of my biggest goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given that I'm not cutting another day from client projects right away, I expect to see at least a 25% increase in my freelance income. But if I'm going to keep devoting extra time to these projects (and away from my own, which is the overall direction I'm heading), my ideal goal is to see more like a 40-50% increase over this year's freelance earnings.</li>
<li>Finish the first draft of my first horror novel in January, and get through at least one comprehensive revision by year's end.</li>
<li>Get through 2-3 revisions of my first mystery novel so I can get it into the hands of a developmental editor by year's end (though by the end of the summer would be nice). I'm not going to stress over the first game tied to this series yet -- I'll add that later in the year if I get the novel into an editor's hands, assuming the editor I want is even free then.</li>
<li>Launch QuickMystery.com to feature flash fiction, and draft enough flash fiction to cover at least weekly posts from the time the site launches through the end of 2015. Ideally I'd like to launch this site by the end of March at the latest.</li>
<li>Overhaul my 5 Year Publishing plan to create a stricter, deadline-oriented project calendar rather than its current quarterly breakdown.</li>
<li>Conduct a complete content audit and massive overhaul of my small business niche blog. Nearly every post is expected to undergo revisions or even removal if they're too dated to be saved.</li>
<li>Some big changes are coming to my business site. It's already resource-heavy compared to most freelancers' client-targeted sites, but in 2015 it'll become even more focused on prospect-focused resources.</li>
<li>I won't go into the details here, but I have a lot of administrative work and improvements scheduled here as well -- from back-end improvements to new freebies and a few premium additions.</li>
</ul>
<p>My full goal list also includes picture book manuscripts (less of a priority in 2015), short stories, and several new sites I plan to launch (not necessarily blogs, so most of their work is in the development stage). I also plan to get through the rough draft of at least two novels -- the next mystery and one under one of my private, more experimental, pen names.</p>
<p>What about you? Have you reviewed your progress this year yet? Have you set your 2015 writing or publishing goals? Tell me about some of the big things you plan to accomplish next year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I'd like to tackle a reader question from Evgeni Puzankov related to selling writing to English-language publications when English isn't your first language. Can you do so successfully?</p>
<blockquote><p>"The question that plagues me throughout my adult life is whether one can actually make it in anglophone writing biz, while not being a native.</p>
<p>I'm Russian and still live here. My mother sent me to English classes when I was about 4 and it was the beginning of my downfall. Now I'm 25 and have this dream to get at least one short story written in English published.</p>
<p>Is there any chance for me despite my nationality?"</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Short Answer</h2>
<p>Yes! You can absolutely succeed in English-language markets even if English isn't your first language, no matter where you live. Writers do it all the time. I know successful writers from Pakistan, India, Italy, and numerous other countries who work with English-language markets. And if you read their work, you probably wouldn't even know English wasn't their first language.</p>
<p>That's the key. If you're targeting publications that cater to English-speaking <em>readers</em>, your work needs to be on par with what they're used to.</p>
<h2>Tips on Succeeding in English-language Markets</h2>
<p>While you can certainly succeed writing in English (or in any language you might be fluent in, even if it's not your first language), that doesn't mean it will always be easy. Here are a few tips that might help:</p>
<h3>1. Read as much as possible in the language you plan to write in.</h3>
<p>Better yet, read as much as you can from past issues of the publications you plan to target. Compare the style of your writing to the stories they've already published. You'll have a better chance of landing a contract if your styles are a good fit for each other.</p>
<h3>2. Make sure you can accept payments from your target publication's country.</h3>
<p>For example, make sure your bank can process a check in their local currency, and find out if the transaction fees are reasonable enough compared to the pay rate to be worth it. You can also look into online payment processors available in your country, like PayPal. Most of my work comes from overseas clients, and this is the route we usually take. It shouldn't be a problem for most online publications, but it might be more difficult to get offline publications to pay you through these kinds of services.</p>
<h3>3. Join a writing group with native English speakers.</h3>
<p>There are some common giveaways when a writer isn't a native English speaker. In the worst cases, the writing is barely readable to English-speaking readers. But sometimes those giveaways are more subtle, such as using very formal language in markets where people are used to stories written in a more conversational tone.</p>
<p>Sometimes these issues won't be clear to you because you know what your words meant. By joining a writing group you get feedback from others before pitching your stories to publications. That can help you sort out problems, big and small, before your work is reviewed by an editor. The better your first impression is, the less likely an editor should be to care about your location.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean you can be published by all publications in your target country. Some hire only local or regional writers. And others will only hire writers from their own country or a small group of countries for tax or payment reasons.</p>
<p>Now, a question for the All Indie Writers community: Have any of you been through this, pitching work in a language other than your first? If you've done so successfully, what tips would you offer Evgeni?</p>
