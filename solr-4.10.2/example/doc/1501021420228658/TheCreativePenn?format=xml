				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After wrestling with <a title="letting go of self censorship" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/11/20/writing-fiction-shadow/" target="_blank">letting go of self-censorship</a> in 2014, I am ready to embrace the ups and downs of the creative process in 2015. As Dean Wesley Smith says, &#8220;<a title="dare to be bad" href="http://www.deanwesleysmith.com/the-new-world-of-writing-dare-to-be-bad/" target="_blank">Dare to be bad</a>,&#8221; and something good will come out of it!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/silkegb/2633237471/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20698" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2014-12-02-at-1.51.19-pm-1024x661.jpg" alt="colors" width="400" height="258" /></a>I feel as if my basic process and business model is now (finally) set, and now all I have to do is repeat it in order to develop my craft and grow the business. <a title="know your rights" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/01/07/know-your-rights/" target="_blank">This is the magic of intellectual property!</a></p>
<p>Essentially, the model is: <strong>trust emergence</strong> and continue to feed the muse in order to write (which for me involves travel and research), turn those ideas into books, turn that one book into multiple products, distribute globally and reach readers through marketing, and then repeat.</p>
<h3>Oh yes, and have a great life along the way!</h3>
<p>That&#8217;s important, as if you&#8217;re not loving this, then you&#8217;re better off getting a &#8216;real&#8217; job. No one said this was easy after all, and there are much easier ways of making a living. But if you love it, there&#8217;s no better life!</p>
<p>I find all the aspects of being indie fun, so my focus now is more on creativity and the craft of writing to make the books better, and speeding up the various parts of the process, while still enjoying the journey. Here&#8217;s how that translates into my goals for 2015.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/seeminglee/3882941631/"><img class="alignright wp-image-20764 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2014-12-31-at-7.15.03-am-300x287.jpg" alt="notebooks" width="300" height="287" /></a>Creating new things in the world!</h2>
<p>This is what it&#8217;s all about! I measure my life by what I create now and although this is a list of &#8216;production,&#8217; my focus this year will be on deepening creative practice as well. That&#8217;s just not so measurable, and goals generally need to be measurable <img src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>6 books out in 2015.</strong> A combination of novels, novellas and non-fiction, all in ebook, print and audiobook formats. Three more ARKANE books, Deviance in the London Psychic series plus a minor character spinoff and two books in a new supernatural series. This should turn into 18+ products once each book is turned into the various formats.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Narrate my own non-fiction audiobooks</strong> and publish them on Audible. I&#8217;m also looking at doing royalty split deals with other non-fiction authors and getting into ACX as a narrator as well as an author. Like anyone, I used to hate my voice, but after 4 years of podcasting, I am pretty used to it now and I get so many emails from people who like to listen to it. Narration of other people&#8217;s non-fiction books on a royalty split deal will add another income stream as well, so I will announce availability after I get my own 4 non-fiction books done first.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Translations:</strong> While this is not a primary focus, I do have Portuguese underway for Pentecost as Brazil is likely to be the next emerging market for digital. I also have How to Market a Book coming in German, as well as Prophecy and Desecration in Spanish, so I&#8217;m certainly carrying on, but not expanding too much. I am only one person and it showed this year! I will be doing a review of the translation stuff with sales data in Feb/March once I have a bit more historical information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foreign rights.</strong> I actually want to sell more rights rather than exploit them myself. The translation stuff takes a lot more effort than expected, so I won&#8217;t be doing so much of that in 2015. I have various things bubbling around foreign rights sales, and expect to get into this more in 2015.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Filling the creative well, education and creative habits</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn how to edit audiobooks</strong> for Audible/ACX quality in order to produce my own non-fiction audiobooks. <a title="audiobooks for indies" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/12/13/audiobooks-simon-whistler/" target="_blank">See the interview with Simon Whistler </a>for help on this and his great book, <a title="audiobooks for indies" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PW8TNX0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00PW8TNX0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=WPNVV7HYIWMKB4CX" target="_blank">Audiobooks for Indies</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Robert McKee Genre &amp; TV writing days in London, Fall 2015 for more story focus. I learned so much from McKee&#8217;s STORY conference that I am keen to build on that.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Continue to do courses by Dean Wesley Smith &amp; Kris Rusch to <strong>improve my craft and writing business</strong> &#8211; you can find out <a title="dean wesley smith courses" href="http://www.deanwesleysmith.com/online-workshops/" target="_blank">more on them here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Travel more for research and fun!</strong> Traveling feeds my muse and gives me story ideas for my fiction, so I need more of it in 2015 &#8230;</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_20762" style="width: 222px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dullhunk/8385768077/"><img class="wp-image-20762 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2014-12-31-at-7.02.27-am-212x300.jpg" alt="alarm clock" width="212" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">No social media, no internet &#8230; it&#8217;s just an alarm clock!</p></div>
<p>I also feel that I need to change up my creative routines and habits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No apps or email before lunchtime.</strong> I&#8217;ve had over a year of not using email on my phone &#8211; but I have ended up checking other things e.g. Guardian app for news, Twitter, RSS feeds and other things. I sometimes check it in the morning when I am still in bed as I use my phone as an alarm. It&#8217;s hard to resist &#8220;just checking a few things&#8221;! I have bought an <strong>old-fashioned alarm clock</strong> &#8211; shock horror, it only tells the time and has an alarm function with one ring tone! The mornings are for creativity, writing first draft stuff, walking with my husband and I&#8217;m also starting with Headspace for (once again) attempting to incorporate meditation in my life.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Community</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Continue to blog and podcast at The Creative Penn</strong> for another year, as well as continuing to share useful information on Twitter @thecreativepenn. My aim is to provide graduate level education and inspiration for the indie author community. I&#8217;m not going anywhere so I hope you&#8217;ll stick around for another year <img src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></li>
<li>I&#8217;m also intending to do more Q&amp;A videos, so check out <a title="youtube thecreativepenn" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thecreativepenn" target="_blank">my YouTube channel here</a> if you like vids.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ll continue to try and answer all my email, but I won&#8217;t be answering basic questions like &#8220;how do I self-publish&#8221; and &#8220;how can I sell more books,&#8221; as I have all the free <a title="resources" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/resources/" target="_blank">resources here</a> to help people. If you have a more nuanced question, feel free to <a title="contact me" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/contact/" target="_blank">contact me!</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Be an active member of the <a title="alliance of independent authors" href="http://allianceindependentauthors.org/?affid=88" target="_blank">Alliance of Independent Authors</a>, co-hosting the monthly Q&amp;A show with Orna Ross and contributing to the discussion, promoting quality in the indie community.</li>
<li>Be an active member of <a title="ITW" href="http://thrillerwriters.org/" target="_blank">International Thriller Writers</a>, writing for the Big Thrill and organizing UK events</li>
</ul>
<h2>Income</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/59937401@N07/5857148161/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-20767" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2014-12-31-at-7.34.34-am-225x300.jpg" alt="piggy bank" width="225" height="300" /></a>The big change for me in 2015 is the shift away from online education and courses to <strong>income from books and live professional speaking, </strong>as well as affiliate income and sponsorship. Fiction is evergreen and never needs updating (and super fun!) &#8211; whereas I have found that courses constantly need updates and non-fiction needs at least annual updates. There are also pretty much zero customer service issues with fiction! (I&#8217;m not counting fan email which is a pleasure, not &#8216;service&#8217;)</p>
<p>I was intending to withdraw my courses in 2015 anyway, but the <a title="eu vat law change" href="http://onemanbandaccounting.co.uk/eu-vat-changes-2015/" target="_blank">EU VAT law change </a>for digital products pushed me to do this by Dec 31 2014, so that income stream is now over. I need to replace it, as that has been a significant portion since I left the day job. I&#8217;m not writing off doing online education again, but it&#8217;s not a priority.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ramp up <strong>diversified income streams</strong> for my books. I&#8217;m already publishing direct on Amazon, Kobo, iBooks and NOOKPress. I am just returning to publishing through Smashwords for subscription and other minor sites. I&#8217;m finally going to get into Google Play in early 2015. Financially, I want to have my first 5 figure month in 2015. That&#8217;s a stretch goal but I am putting it out there <img src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Move into <strong>audiobook narration</strong> for my own non-fiction as well as other people&#8217;s books. The royalty split options in ACX mean this is potentially a good ongoing income stream and I believe in audio as a growth market. This will be a new income stream, albeit a slow growing one.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Continue to speak internationally for travel and income reasons.</strong> I&#8217;ve already been booked for <a title="Pubsense Charleston" href="http://www.pubsensesummit.com/announcing-2015-pubsense-summit/" target="_blank">PubSense in Charleston, South Carolina</a> in March, as well as the Shetland Islands and Orkney, which must count as travel! You can <a title="speaking" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/speaking/" target="_blank">find my speaking page here</a> if you want to see me live or book me for an event.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Here we are again! The year rushes by and we stand at the end wondering what we achieved in the last 12 months!</h3>
<p>This is one of the reasons I love blogging – the passing of time is actually trackable. We all change, our goals change, but at least by writing out what we want to achieve and then measuring that, we can keep ourselves heading in the right direction!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I set out to do this year <a title="creative goals 2014" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/01/01/creative-goals-2014/" target="_blank">as documented on 1 Jan 2014</a>, and what I managed to achieve:</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/books/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20684" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/NewBooks2014.jpg" alt="New Books 2014" width="300" height="449" /></a>(1a) Stick with Plan A: Write more books and attract more readers</h2>
<p>I didn&#8217;t quite create as many new books as I intended, but here&#8217;s what I did publish in 2014</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="public speaking" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/speakingbook/" target="_blank">Public Speaking for Authors, creatives and other introverts.</a> In ebook and print formats.</li>
<li><a title="day of the vikings" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/vikings/" target="_blank">Day of the Vikings. </a>ARKANE #5. In ebook, print and audiobook formats. I&#8217;m also giving this away for <a title="free book" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/freebook/" target="_blank">free on JFPenn.com </a>at the moment if you want to try it.</li>
<li><a title="delirium" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/delirium/" target="_blank">Delirium, London Psychic Book 2</a>. In ebook, print and audiobook formats.</li>
<li><a title="business for authors" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/businessbook/" target="_blank">Business for Authors: How to be an Author Entrepreneur.</a> In ebook, print and audiobook formats.</li>
<li>Updated Second Edition of <a title="how to market a book" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/howtomarketabook/" target="_blank">How to Market a Book</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jfpenn.com/gates-of-hell/"><img class="alignright wp-image-20691 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/keyfinal1-186x300.jpg" alt="gates of hell" width="186" height="300" /></a>I also finished <a title="gates of hell" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/gates-of-hell/" target="_blank"><em>Gates of Hell</em></a>, it&#8217;s on pre-order right now, publishing 5 Jan in ebook formats and coming soon in print and audiobook.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have done quite a bit of research and networking on the screenplay side of things, but I will be leaving that until 2016 as well. I want to write a screenplay but because it&#8217;s such a new skill, I&#8217;ll be waiting until I am more settled with my fiction production process.</p>
<h2>(1b) Become a better writer</h2>
<p>The focus on the craft is ongoing of course, but this year I have done a couple of things to invest in becoming a better writer:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Thrillerfest" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/07/17/writing-thrillerfest-2014/" target="_blank">Masterclass at Thrillerfest with David Morrell</a> &#8211; a fantastic full day on thriller writing specifically.</li>
<li>4 day <a title="McKee STORY" href="http://mckeestory.com/" target="_blank">STORY conference with Robert McKee </a></li>
<li>Courses with Dean Wesley Smith and Kristine Rusch on productivity, which has included &#8216;getting out of my own way.&#8217; Necessary for someone who still has problems with self-censorship.</li>
<li>And I have found the right editor, <a title="Adian Editing" href="http://www.adianediting.com/" target="_blank">Jen Blood</a>, who both gets my writing style and kicks my ass when I need it. Jen also happens to write <a title="Jen Blood" href="http://jenblood.com/" target="_blank">great thrillers</a> <img src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Working with Jen has enabled me to learn more about effective story structure and improve my craft.</li>
</ul>
<h2>(2) Exploit more rights and focus on global territories</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/self-publishing-translation/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20682" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Translations2014.jpg" alt="Translations2014" width="280" height="427" /></a>I do now have an agent specifically for foreign rights but this year I went into joint venture deals with translators. You can <a title="self publishing translation" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/self-publishing-translation/" target="_blank">read all the articles and interviews here</a>.</p>
<p>As part of 50:50% royalty split, I published the following books. Desecration-Verletzung was published by Ullstein-Midnight for digital rights and we retain print and audiobook rights.</p>
<ul>
<li>GERMAN: <a title="pentecost german" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/pentecost-deutsch/" target="_blank">Pentecost, Ein ARKANE thriller</a> in ebook and print; <a title="german desecration verletzung" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/desecration-verletzung/" target="_blank">Desecration-Verletzung</a> in ebook and print</li>
<li>SPANISH: <a title="pentecostes" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/pentecostes/" target="_blank">Pentecostés</a> in ebook and print</li>
<li>ITALIAN: <a title="Profanazione" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/profanazione/" target="_blank">Profanazione</a> in ebook and print</li>
</ul>
<p>If you read any of these languages and would like a review copy, please <a title="contact joanna penn" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/contact/" target="_blank">contact me</a> <img src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.jfpenn.com/audio/"><img class="alignright wp-image-19037 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ThrillersOnAudiobook-300x226.jpg" alt="ThrillersOnAudiobook" width="300" height="226" /></a>In terms of audiobook rights, ACX expanded into the UK in April 2014 and so <a title="jf penn audiobooks" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/audio/" target="_blank">all my fiction is now available in audio format</a>, and I will be getting into the non-fiction in 2015.</p>
<p>This has added a great new income stream to the business, and I urge you to consider audiobooks if you haven&#8217;t done so already.</p>
<p><strong>So even though I &#8216;only&#8217; wrote 4 new individual books, I actually produced 19 new products</strong> for my author business, each bringing in a new income stream. This is the magic of publishing and intellectual property rights, and if the penny hasn&#8217;t dropped for you on this yet, <a title="know your rights" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/01/07/know-your-rights/" target="_blank">read this post</a>.</p>
<h2>(3) Professional speaking</h2>

<p>My aim was to develop my speaking in 2014 and take it further than before. Things have definitely shifted as because of demand, I have had to decline a number of events. I love to help people but events have to serve one of two other purposes now: revenue or expenses paid international travel, and preferably both of these!</p>
<p>In 2014, I have spoken internationally in New York on a Thrillerfest panel, Toronto at Kobo HQ, Stockholm, Sweden for an event on self-publishing, Frankfurt Book Fair and Auckland, New Zealand. I&#8217;ve also spoken at a number of events in the UK, plus I&#8217;ve also run my own full day events on book marketing as well as how to make a living from your writing, which I hope to repeat in 2015.</p>
<h2>(4) Focus more on creative entrepreneurship on the blog, podcast and YouTube channel</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve definitely shifted focus this year, posting regularly on the creative entrepreneurship side of things, to go alongside my own development and the writing of Business for Authors book.</p>
<p>You can find a <a title="author entrepreneur" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/entrepreneur/" target="_blank">roundup of the entrepreneurial posts here</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to <a title="fighting overwhelm" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/04/24/fighting-overwhelm/" target="_blank">remove guest posts in April</a>, and am really happy with that decision because it focuses the blog on my personal take on the fast-changing indie world, and I continue to share other people&#8217;s thoughts through the podcast and interviews.</p>
<p><a title="The Creative Penn podcast" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">The Creative Penn podcast</a><a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/podcasts/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-16835" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/CreativePennPodcastButton_240x240.jpg" alt="creative penn podcast" width="200" height="200" /></a> hit 200 episodes, you can listen to the <a title="reinvention 200" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/11/01/reinvention-special-200/" target="_blank">round-up episode here</a>.

Very cool <img src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>I was also in a couple of other box-sets – The Indie PowerPack, Thrill Ride and <a title="dark trinity" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ONG04CQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00ONG04CQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=HNRQM32Z5G6R5XT6" target="_blank">Dark Trinity</a> – and will continue to look for collaboration opportunities in 2015.</p>
<p>Overall, I feel that 2014 has been a pivotal year in my creative career and I&#8217;ve stepped up a rung on the ladder in terms of my professionalism as an author, and in my maturity as a writer and creative entrepreneur. I am certain this is what I want to do with my life &#8211; it&#8217;s now about developing my craft and developing my business over time. And of course, loving the journey!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m ready to step it up again in 2015 &#8211; I hope you will join me!</p>

<p>I read Tony Robbins&#8217; self-help books when I was trying to change my life in 2006/2007 and his message of empowerment is the driver behind my own optimism and pursuit of the dream. In fact, I started professional speaking because I wanted to BE the next Tony Robbins &#8211; I&#8217;d like to think I am one of the inspirational voices in the indie movement at least!</p>
<p>This book on money is his first book in 20+ years and his decision to research and write it was sparked by the generally inept way that governments have dealt with the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis. This is a massive book, but it will truly help you take control of your finances. I&#8217;ve been reading it slowly since it came out in November and intend to make a plan to implement its advice in 2015. As author-entrepreneurs, we care about money: we want to make it and use it to help our families and others as well as have a good life. This book will help. It&#8217;s not an easy read despite the word &#8216;simple&#8217; in the title, but some of the aspects inside may have a huge impact on your future quality of life. It&#8217;s worth investing the time.</p>
<h2>Fiction I&#8217;ve enjoyed this year</h2>

<p>Secret service agent Ethan Burke arrives in Wayward Pines, Idaho, with a clear mission: locate and recover two federal agents who went missing in the bucolic town one month earlier. But within minutes of his arrival, Ethan is involved in a violent accident. He comes to in a hospital, with no ID, no cell phone, and no briefcase. The medical staff seems friendly enough, but something feels…off. Each step closer to the truth takes Ethan further from the world he thought he knew, from the man he thought he was, until he must face a horrifying fact—he may never get out of Wayward Pines alive.</p>
<p>When the twist comes in this book, you won&#8217;t be able to stop reading the rest of the series. Will soon be a TV show, so read the book before you know what happens!</p>

But then secrets from Italy’s dark wartime past begin to surface—revelations that could put them all in danger. To save his own skin, Daniel must decide how far he’s willing to let them in.</p>

<p>The book Hugh doesn&#8217;t want you to read! This is definitely very dark &#8211; you have been warned. I don&#8217;t read many zombie books but this one is more about free will, or lack of it. Will make you think &#8211; but don&#8217;t read after eating too much Xmas pud.</p>

<p>When novelist Owen Quine goes missing, his wife calls in private detective Cormoran Strike.</p>
<p>When Quine is found brutally murdered under bizarre circumstances, it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer, a killer unlike any Strike has encountered before&#8230;</p>
<p>Full of observations about the media and publishing industry, which of course, JK Rowling knows all about! I love Cormoran and his sidekick Robin, a fantastic new series.</p>

<p>The brilliants changed everything.</p>
<p>Since 1980, 1% of the world has been born with gifts we’d only dreamed of. The ability to sense a person’s most intimate secrets, or predict the stock market, or move virtually unseen. For thirty years the world has struggled with a growing divide between the exceptional&#8230;and the rest of us.</p>
<p>Now a terrorist network led by brilliants has crippled three cities. Supermarket shelves stand empty. 911 calls go unanswered. Fanatics are burning people alive.</p>
<p>Technothriller-ish with a touch of sci-fi.</p>

<p>Jack Sigler, Callsign: King, has been a lot of things in his life. A soldier, a father, a hero. But now he’s taking up a new title: guardian. After a life fighting billionaire madmen, terrorists and unnatural threats, he’s stuck thousands of years in the past, using his knowledge of history and modern warfare to right wrongs and stand up for those in need.</p>
<p>When he meets a twelve year old boy—the prince of the Babylonian Empire—who is to be sacrificed to the ancient goddess, Tiamat, by a twisted High Priest, King steps in, sword swinging. But what starts as a simple snatch and grab, quickly turns into a pitched battle against a legion of men and hideous creatures. As Tiamat rises from her ancient resting place, the fate of the world—and King’s future—is at stake.</p>
<p>If you want pure escapist fun, Robinson always delivers! Plus, I have a degree in Theology and studied the ancient Babylonians so this was interesting from another perspective.</p>
<h2>Oh yes, and here are the books I&#8217;ve published this year, in case you&#8217;d like to try one of these!</h2>
<h2>Day of the Vikings</h2>
<h4><em>A ritual murder on a remote island under the shifting skies of the aurora borealis. </em><em>A staff of power that can summon Ragnarok, the Viking apocalypse.</em></h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K49B3X0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00K49B3X0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=3ZKWZTZUTVQ2VFUO"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1155" src="http://www.jfpenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/VikingsSmall.jpg" alt="Day of the Vikings" width="191" height="287" /></a>When Neo-Viking terrorists invade the British Museum in London to reclaim the staff of Skara Brae, ARKANE agent Dr. Morgan Sierra is trapped in the building along with hostages under mortal threat.</p>
<p>As the slaughter begins, Morgan works alongside psychic Blake Daniel to discern the past of the staff, dating back to islands invaded by the Vikings generations ago.</p>
<p><em>Can Morgan and Blake uncover the truth before Ragnarok is unleashed, consuming all in its wake?</em></p>
<p>Day of the Vikings is a fast-paced, action adventure thriller set in the British Museum, the British Library and the islands of Orkney, Lindisfarne and Iona. Set in the present day, it resonates with the history and myth of the Vikings.</p>
<p>Day of the Vikings features Dr. Morgan Sierra from the ARKANE thrillers, and Blake Daniel from the London Mysteries, but it is also a stand-alone novella that can be read and enjoyed separately.</p>

When a prominent psychiatrist is found murdered in the old hospital of Bedlam, Detective Sergeant Jamie Brooke finds herself investigating the history of madness to fathom the motive. Blake Daniel, a reluctant psychic, helps her to research the case, only to discover that his own family are entwined with the shadowy forces that seek to control the minds of the mad.</p>
<p>As the body count rises, and those she loves are threatened, Jamie discovers that the tendrils of conspiracy wind themselves into the very heart of the British government. Can she stop the killer before madness takes its ultimate revenge?</p>
<p>A thriller with an edge of the supernatural, Delirium is a story of love for family, revenge for injustice and the question of whether we all sit on the spectrum of madness somewhere.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s show, I talk to publishing expert Hugh McGuire about <strong>some of the biggest stories of 2014 and how they affect indie authors</strong>. We go through the state of audio, exclusivity and subscription models, discoverability and publishing startups, print on demand, Author Earnings and global development. Exciting times!</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.99designs.com/joanna/"><img class="alignright wp-image-20210 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/99designs-logo-750x200px-300x80.png" alt="99designs-logo-750x200px" width="300" height="80" /></a>This podcast episode is sponsored by <a title="99 designs" href="http://www.99designs.com/joanna/" target="_blank">99 Designs</a>, where you can get all kinds of designs for your author business including book covers, merchandising, branding and business cards, illustrations and artwork and much more.

<p><a href="http://pressbooks.com/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20709 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-04-at-2.02.43-pm-268x300.jpg" alt="hugh mcguire" width="268" height="300" /></a>Hugh McGuire is an author, professional speaker and publishing expert, the founder of <a href="http://pressbooks.com" target="_blank">PressBooks</a>, an online book publishing platform built on WordPress, and of <a href="http://librivox.org" target="_blank">LibriVox.org</a>, the largest library of free, public domain audiobooks in the world as well as lots of other things!</p>
<p><strong>Audio has been a big shift in 2014</strong>, with ACX opening up to UK authors and a big growth in the audio market. We discuss the popularity of audio and why it might be growing. Hugh mentions how the success of his company <a title="Iambik" href="http://www.iambik.com/" target="_blank">Iambik </a>was in the genre fiction categories, which is the same with ebooks. It&#8217;s still a niche market but worth looking at to extend your rights. As with any content, marketing is still really important to make a dent, although I point out that <strong>discoverability might be easier in audio</strong>, because there are fewer titles. The more channels you&#8217;re in, the more formats you&#8217;re in, the more likely you are to build a long-term business.</p>
<h2>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly fine to have a writing career that isn&#8217;t a business, but don&#8217;t complain when you don&#8217;t make any money at it.&#8221; Hugh McGuire, Pressbooks</h2>
<ul>
<li> We discuss <strong>exclusivity, Kindle Unlimited and subscription models</strong>. Authors have to decide what makes business sense in the short term as well as the long term. It makes sense for new authors to use exclusivity to get some movement, but if you have a longer term business model, a wider base of distribution is better. <strong>Subscription models</strong> are not designed to make money from one individual book, it&#8217;s more of a way to grow the amount people are reading altogether. These models are growing. You will always be better off growing your own email list so you can always reach people directly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discoverability and how some of the publishing startups looked like a great idea</strong>, but haven&#8217;t worked out quite yet! Hugh talks about how the self-containment of the e-reading eco-systems have stopped discoverability. We talk about <a title="readmill app" href="https://gigaom.com/2014/03/28/dropbox-acquires-and-absorbs-reading-app-readmill-app-will-be-shut-down/" target="_blank">Readmill</a>, which focused on social reading and was bought by Dropbox and shut down. We both liked <a title="small demons" href="http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-small-demons-to-close-unless-buyer-appears-20131106-story.html" target="_blank">Small Demons</a>, which looked at the cultural milieu around books e.g. what music is referenced within certain books and discovering other books that also mention that song. Unfortunately, they also went out of business. [Side note: I did ask them at a conference why they didn&#8217;t open up to indie authors so we could create content for them, but they only wanted to work with trad pub. I still like the idea!] We also talk about <a title="wattpad" href="http://www.wattpad.com" target="_blank">Wattpad</a>, which is a great startup that is thriving, although its user base may be quite different to mainstream publishing at the moment. And of course, we still love <a title="smashwords" href="http://www.smashwords.com/" target="_blank">Smashwords</a>, and Mark has always focused on indies!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a title="Pressbooks" href="http://pressbooks.com/" target="_blank">Pressbooks</a><a href="http://pressbooks.com/" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-20710 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-04-at-2.03.40-pm-300x87.jpg" alt="pressbooks" width="300" height="87" /></a> is based on producing beautiful print on demand files easily from your manuscript and the interface is built on WordPress so it&#8217;s easy for bloggers to use. There are multiple ebook outputs as well, but it&#8217;s focused on the print on demand aspect primarily. We discuss <strong>the importance of print to the market but how more print sales will go online over time</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global market expansion</strong>. We talk about whether the next big thing will come out of another territory. Hugh mentions that African countries are &#8216;skipping&#8217; technology e.g. moving directly to cellphones instead of landlines, and to mobile tech instead of desktops or laptops. There&#8217;s also fantastic innovation coming out of these other markets. English language authors do have an advantage as we&#8217;ve been thinking about this for several years now &#8211; compare this to French authors or other places where the digital revolution has barely begun.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a title="Author Earnings" href="http://authorearnings.com/" target="_blank">Author Earnings</a> and how supply is increasing. I talk about how my hope is that the romance authors are just ahead of the curve because they started earlier in digital, and that <strong>other genres will catch up in terms of % dominance by indie authors</strong>. In thrillers, it&#8217;s still dominated by trad pub, but we&#8217;re on our way up!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We discuss the fact that <strong>the &#8216;bleeding edge&#8217; of publishing is actually here already!</strong> The self-publishing big names are becoming small presses, publishing other people as H M Ward has now started doing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall, a positive time for creators!</h2>

		<itunes:summary>In today's show, I talk to publishing expert Hugh McGuire about some of the biggest stories of 2014 and how they affect indie authors. We go through the state of audio, exclusivity and subscription models, discoverability and publishing startups, print on demand, Author Earnings and global development. Exciting times!

(http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-04-at-2.02.43-pm-268x300.jpg)Hugh McGuire is an author, professional speaker and publishing expert, the founder of PressBooks (http://pressbooks.com), an online book publishing platform built on WordPress, and of LibriVox.org (http://librivox.org), the largest library of free, public domain audiobooks in the world as well as lots of other things!

Audio has been a big shift in 2014, with ACX opening up to UK authors and a big growth in the audio market. We discuss the popularity of audio and why it might be growing. Hugh mentions how the success of his company Iambik  (http://www.iambik.com/)was in the genre fiction categories, which is the same with ebooks. It's still a niche market but worth looking at to extend your rights. As with any content, marketing is still really important to make a dent, although I point out that discoverability might be easier in audio, because there are fewer titles. The more channels you're in, the more formats you're in, the more likely you are to build a long-term business.
"It's perfectly fine to have a writing career that isn't a business, but don't complain when you don't make any money at it." Hugh McGuire, Pressbooks

	*  We discuss exclusivity, Kindle Unlimited and subscription models. Authors have to decide what makes business sense in the short term as well as the long term. It makes sense for new authors to use exclusivity to get some movement, but if you have a longer term business model, a wider base of distribution is better. Subscription models are not designed to make money from one individual book, it's more of a way to grow the amount people are reading altogether. These models are growing. You will always be better off growing your own email list so you can always reach people directly.


	* Discoverability and how some of the publishing startups looked like a great idea, but haven't worked out quite yet! Hugh talks about how the self-containment of the e-reading eco-systems have stopped discoverability. We talk about Readmill (https://gigaom.com/2014/03/28/dropbox-acquires-and-absorbs-reading-app-readmill-app-will-be-shut-down/), which focused on social reading and was bought by Dropbox and shut down. We both liked Small Demons (http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-small-demons-to-close-unless-buyer-appears-20131106-story.html), which looked at the cultural milieu around books e.g. what music is referenced within certain books and discovering other books that also mention that song. Unfortunately, they also went out of business. [Side note: I did ask them at a conference why they didn't open up to indie authors so we could create content for them, but they only wanted to work with trad pub. I still like the idea!] We also talk about Wattpad (http://www.wattpad.com), which is a great startup that is thriving, although its user base may be quite different to mainstream publishing at the moment. And of course, we still love Smashwords (http://www.smashwords.com/), and Mark has always focused on indies!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just did a fantastic event in Auckland, New Zealand, so a big thanks to everyone who came! Plus a big thanks to <a title="booktrack" href="http://www.booktrack.com" target="_blank">BookTrack</a> who sponsored and organized the event, as well as Auckland Libraries who hosted it.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.booktrack.com"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20594" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/booktracklogo.jpg" alt="booktrack" width="400" height="176" /></a>So what is Booktrack?</h2>
<p>First up, watch this quick video to get the idea about what it is &#8211; watch below or <a title="booktrack overview" href="http://youtu.be/59ixz6udGzQ" target="_blank">here on YouTube </a></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/59ixz6udGzQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In order to learn more about this, I interviewed Paul Cameron, CEO and co-founder of Booktrack about the service. In this video, we talk about why he and his brother started the company and what they want to achieve, as well as the benefits for authors and readers. You can watch below or <a title="paul cameron booktrack" href="http://youtu.be/REQAFhy0Sj8" target="_blank">here on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of our discussion include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People often read in public accompanied by a soundtrack of some kind &#8211; either to shut out ambient noise, or to accompany the story.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Books are (currently) one of the only entertainment choices that doesn&#8217;t have synchronized sound.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Authors often choose soundtracks as they write, and share it with readers. For example, check out the <a title="undercover soundtrack" href="http://mymemoriesofafuturelife.com/category/undercover-soundtrack/" target="_blank">Undercover Soundtrack on Roz Morris&#8217; blog </a></li>
<li>Booktrack takes a <strong>movie style soundtrack and synchronizes it with individual reading speed</strong> via apps. You can create these yourself for free &#8211; and it&#8217;s super fun!</li>
<li>Booktrack has a LOT of music and sound available to use &#8211; you can&#8217;t just use any music because of copyright</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.booktrackclassroom.com/#!/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-20596" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-25-at-3.38.08-pm-300x109.jpg" alt="booktrack classroom" width="300" height="109" /></a>They also have an education side, <a title="booktrack classroom" href="http://www.booktrackclassroom.com/#!/" target="_blank">Booktrack Classroom</a>, where schools are using books to help children engage with texts. <a title="university studies on retention" href="http://info.booktrackclassroom.com/university-studies" target="_blank">Studies show that people retain far more when they read with a soundtrack</a>. It&#8217;s also fun to create, and music means a lot for certain age groups.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I mention how soundtracks on film are designed to <strong>underscore emotional elements</strong>, and no film is complete now without a soundtrack. Booktrack is aiming to get to this point in the future.</li>
<li>Readers can find Booktrack on the app stores or online <a title="booktrack" href="http://www.booktrack.com" target="_blank">Booktrack.com</a> &#8211; it&#8217;s free to use and try at the moment.</li>
<li>The company&#8217;s aim is to become something similar to Audible but without words &#8211; <strong>selling books with soundtracks direct to consumers</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http://www.booktrack.com/#!/?booktrackId=cb3b35953dfd408fa4d4f5cf4541ca96"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-20601" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-25-at-4.27.11-pm-180x300.jpg" alt="budapest booktrack" width="180" height="300" /></a>Marketing and sales with BookTrack</h2>
<p>Book marketing is a constant challenge for us all and one way to <strong>stand out is by having more than just text available</strong>. If you can add sound to your words, it brings another atmospheric dimension to the reading experience, and may be enough to draw people into your book.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to do is to check out a few books. Here&#8217;s my <a title="one day in budapest" href="http://www.booktrack.com/read/cb3b35953dfd408fa4d4f5cf4541ca96" target="_blank">prologue for One Day In Budapest</a>, and <a title="Sand Hugh Howey" href="http://www.booktrack.com/read/73875b0430fd437cac7cbf9ff0bd8687" target="_blank">Hugh Howey&#8217;s Sand</a></p>
<p>You can easily share the Booktracks on social media and email, and coming soon, you&#8217;ll be able to use embeddable widgets on your website.</p>
<p>In terms of monetization, you can add a link to all the platforms where people can buy your book as part of the free aspect of the platform. In 2015, Booktracks will be available for sale, so could provide another revenue stream.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.booktrack.com"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-20597" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-25-at-3.52.47-pm-1024x209.jpg" alt="booktrack" width="600" height="123" /></a></p>
<h2>Five useful tips for using Booktrack</h2>
<p>I asked author <a title="Dawn Grant" href="http://www.dcgrant.co.nz/" target="_blank">D.C.Grant </a>to share her tips for using the service. You can check out her book, <a title="where the flag floats" href="http://www.booktrack.com/read/fcd7cb6876494b33a4b5c4ccf18fc247" target="_blank">Where the flag floats, here on Booktrack</a>.</p>
<p>Dawn also has a book for authors, <a title="booktrack for authors" href="http://www.booktrack.com/#!/bookshelf?booktrackId=339829357ddf499db4684a1c3e04c9fb" target="_blank">The Booktrack Author User Guide</a>, which will help you if you want to do DIY.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.booktrack.com/read/fcd7cb6876494b33a4b5c4ccf18fc247"><img class="alignright wp-image-20612 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-27-at-8.52.44-am-172x300.jpg" alt="flag floats" width="172" height="300" /></a>When you are creating a sound track for your book using Booktrack, it is called booktracking.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Treat booktracking time like writing time</strong> – block off a period of time with no distractions, switch off email/ text message/social media notifications. Also limit or exclude other sounds, or work using a headset so that you can concentrate on the tracks.</li>
<li><strong>Booktrack short sections</strong> at a time. Don’t attempt to do too much all at once.</li>
<li><strong>Keep pen and paper handy</strong>, or a note-taking app like OneNote, to make a note of the tracks that appeal to you as you go through the results of your search criteria. It’ll be a certainty that you won’t remember the track that you liked on page 2 by the time you get to page 6.</li>
<li>If you find the diversity of music tracks overwhelming, <strong>search for a composer whose music suits the genre/theme of your book</strong> and make that your ‘go-to’ composer when choosing tracks. For a showcase of composers and the type of music they produce, use the Booktrack Music Showcase.</li>
<li><strong>Layer your sound</strong> – start with music, then layer on an ambience track and finish with sound effects. Or layer two ambience tracks and then sound effects. Or a music track and two ambience tracks and no sound effects. The choice is up to you. You can layer on as many tracks as you like, but too many and things may get muddled! <strong>Play it back</strong> to make sure it’s not too much and that the sound effects don’t get overwhelmed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Booktracking can appear daunting but there’s no better way to learn that to just jump in and do it! Have a go today.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Simon talks a bit about his background, with a degree in business</strong>, then working in Sri Lanka before moving to Prague. He started narrating audiobooks and working with indie authors, and then started his podcast, Rocking Self Publishing, before deciding to write a book about audiobooks to help authors get their books out there. We talk about the creative hub that Prague is turning into &#8230; We discuss entrepreneurship and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PW8TNX0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00PW8TNX0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=WPNVV7HYIWMKB4CX"><img class="alignright wp-image-20644 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-28-at-5.44.05-pm-196x300.jpg" alt="audiobooks for indies" width="196" height="300" /></a>the mindset shift from writing a book to running a business as an author.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why the audiobook market is growing so fast.</strong> Basically because Amazon is behind it, plus the advance of digital technology. People can consume while they do other things, and it&#8217;s on demand now through wireless technology. It can also help you stand out as there are far fewer books available in audio, plus Whispersync means people can combine editions on their Kindle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On ACX and how it works.</strong> You can also <a title="distributing with acx and marketing audiobooks" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/05/01/audiobooks-acx-marketing/" target="_blank">read more about my experience with ACX in publishing and marketing here</a>. We talk about pricing, ACX bounty, marketing, Whispersync and how the various payments work, as well as how to select a narrator.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best practices for working with a voice talent</strong>. We talk about adaptation, interpretation and respecting creative expression &#8211; as well as balancing it with how you want the book to be.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On fiction and non-fiction audiobooks.</strong> Often listeners want to hear the author read non-fiction, so if you can, narrate it yourself. For fiction, you need to do voices and things, so it&#8217;s best to get a professional. Simon talks about using basic equipment for audiobook narration &#8211; you don&#8217;t need to complicate things and it will only cost you a couple hundred $ to get started. Before you do anything, read your book out loud and see how you feel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Getting over your voice</strong>. We talk about becoming a narrator and how it can become another income stream, on when to take royalty split deals, and more. I am considering getting further into narration in 2015, only for non-fiction though.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On podcasting</strong> and when authors should consider it. We talk about the commitment in time per episode as well as how long it takes to get some traction with an audience. Like writing, it&#8217;s a long term game! We also talk a bit about <strong>video and YouTube</strong> &#8211; the most important thing is regular content. Most successful vloggers are doing videos several times a week. We also mention <a title="skype translator" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJIILew6l28#t=36" target="_blank">Skype Translator</a> &#8211; which translates as you speak &#8211; only in beginning stages, but wow! It&#8217;s like Star Trek!</li>

	* Simon talks a bit about his background, with a degree in business, then working in Sri Lanka before moving to Prague. He started narrating audiobooks and working with indie authors, and then started his podcast, Rocking Self Publishing, before deciding to write a book about audiobooks to help authors get their books out there. We talk about the creative hub that Prague is turning into ... We discuss entrepreneurship and (http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-28-at-5.44.05-pm-196x300.jpg)the mindset shift from writing a book to running a business as an author.


	* Why the audiobook market is growing so fast. Basically because Amazon is behind it, plus the advance of digital technology. People can consume while they do other things, and it's on demand now through wireless technology. It can also help you stand out as there are far fewer books available in audio, plus Whispersync means people can combine editions on their Kindle.


	* On ACX and how it works. You can also read more about my experience with ACX in publishing and marketing here (http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/05/01/audiobooks-acx-marketing/). We talk about pricing, ACX bounty, marketing, Whispersync and how the various payments work, as well as how to select a narrator.


	* Best practices for working with a voice talent. We talk about adaptation, interpretation and respecting creative expression - as well as balancing it with how you want the book to be.


	* On fiction and non-fiction audiobooks. Often listeners want to hear the author read non-fiction, so if you can, narrate it yourself. For fiction, you need to do voices and things, so it's best to get a professional. Simon talks about using basic equipment for audiobook narration - you don't need to complicate things and it will only cost you a couple hundred $ to get started. Before you do anything, read your book out loud and see how you feel.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The fast-growing self-publishing environment is attracting all kinds of start-ups and companies that intend to serve authors.</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fensterbme/4783366926/ "><img class="alignleft wp-image-20513" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-16-at-5.40.24-pm-300x166.jpg" alt="editing" width="450" height="250" /></a>However, most of them seem to aim at the periphery of what authors really need, which in my opinion, is primarily editors and cover designers.</p>
<p>Then I met Ricardo Fayet at a number of events, and discovered that his start-up, <a title="Reedsy" href="https://reedsy.com/" target="_blank">Reedsy</a>, is aimed at connecting indie authors with editors and other professionals. The providers on the site are curated so you can trust that they offer a quality service.</p>
<p>Reedsy itself is a partner member of the <a title="alliance of independent authors" href="http://allianceindependentauthors.org/?affid=88" target="_blank">Alliance of Independent Authors</a>, which also gives it another level of trust, in my opinion. Here&#8217;s a piece on the company in <a title="techcrunch reedsy" href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/06/reedsy-launches-its-marketplace-for-indie-authors-to-unbundle-traditional-publishing-houses/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>.</p>
<p>I asked Ricardo a few questions about what he sees in successful indie authors and what Reedsy can do for them.</p>
<h2><strong>You go to a lot of author events. What are the commonalities you see in successful indie authors?</strong></h2>
<p>First, and this is something that has always struck me, I’m amazed at how <strong>indies are all such positive and energetic people</strong>. Or at least this is what they all appear to be (I know you have repeatedly said you have a<a title="JF Penn" href="http://www.jfpenn.com" target="_blank"> dark side</a> &#8211; I can’t imagine it, but I’ll take your word for it).</p>
<p>I think <strong>this kind of positive energy is absolutely key for indie authors today</strong>: you have got to believe that you can make it and persevere in your work with that belief until things begin to pick up. The process is slow and tedious and it’s easy to get discouraged after you’ve put the first couple of books out there and see they’re not selling themselves…</p>
<p>I also see <strong>a willingness to experiment.</strong> Distribution models have changed, and so have marketing ones. Thinking outside the traditional box usually pays off, but that requires a lot of trying new things and techniques, failing, and “iterating” (to use the start-up jargon).</p>
<p>Finally, I see<strong> union and an incredible willingness to help each other</strong>. All successful indie authors have become successful partly thanks to other authors. Bella Andre and Tina Folsom have been working together (literally) for years now. You have been interviewing authors for years too. <a title="alliance of independent authors" href="http://allianceindependentauthors.org/?affid=88" target="_blank">The Alliance of Independent Authors</a> was born out of this belief that indies don’t compete for space on the Kindle Store, they grow stronger together.</p>
<h2><strong>You&#8217;re a businessman and an entrepreneur with a start-up. What can indie authors learn from entrepreneurs? </strong></h2>
<p>All three points I mentioned in the previous questions! I think this is why we get on well together.</p>
<p><strong>As an entrepreneur, you also have to “build your team.”</strong> Once you do, entrepreneurs are faced with the same problem indies have once your product or your book is up and running: it doesn’t sell itself…</p>
<p>The difference is that entrepreneurs are often a little more educated about all the major challenges on the road from the start of their journey, whereas some starting authors go into self-publishing unprepared, or believing it will be relatively easy.</p>
<p>Start-up entrepreneurs are pushed by their investors to sell, so they market their product before it’s live, they beta-test it before releasing it, they continually improve it afterwards, etc. <strong>This pressure makes us more creative in our marketing efforts</strong>, and I think indie authors could get a lot of ideas by following the start-ups in their industry, reading their newsletters and observing their marketing efforts.</p>
<p>In way, it’s very difficult to remain oblivious to these challenges as an entrepreneur &#8211; there’s no temptation to develop a product in an ivory tower because it’s not an option.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://reedsy.com"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-20512" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/blog_post_image-300x168.jpg" alt="reedsy" width="300" height="168" /></a>One of the biggest problems for indie authors is finding professionals to work with. How does Reedsy help with this issue?</strong></h2>
<p>There’s all kinds of problems with finding good editors, designers, basically any variety of professional. Reedsy makes it easy to find and work with the best professionals &#8211; emphasis on both ‘easy’ and ‘best.’</p>
<p>Take editors as an example. First of all, there’s the challenge of finding them &#8211; Google is awesome, but if you search for ‘freelance editors’ you’re not being shown the best editors, but rather the editors who are best at SEO. Basically, there’s not much of a connection between visibility and quality.</p>
<p>Eventually you make your shortlist, and start exploring working together &#8211; maybe making a spreadsheet along the way of prices, of terms, sending out samples for editing, comparing what you get back… All which is this process you have to micromanage by designing a custom email folder hierarchy…</p>
<p>And that doesn’t even get into what’s involved in tracking drafts and the evolution of a manuscript across multiple rounds of editing. It’s exhausting.</p>
<div id="attachment_20514" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-20514" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-16-at-5.44.32-pm-215x300.jpg" alt="editing" width="250" height="348" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Example of Reedsy editor search with some of the freelancers available</p></div>
<p>So, Reedsy is an easy solution to all of this hassle. We have a growing network of great freelancers &#8211; respectful of their clients, established, experienced, skilled. You’ll be able to manage messaging freelancers, sending  and comparing sample edits, receiving quotes, and negotiating terms from one website. And when you start working together you’ll be able to track the history of the entire collaboration, from the very beginning, through our upcoming gorgeous editor.</p>
<p>The best thing about Reedsy is we make things easier for indie authors without taking away control. We make it an easy process, without taking it out of the author’s hands. That’s really important.</p>
<h2><strong>How can an author evaluate whether an editor or designer is the right one for them?</strong></h2>
<p>There’s all kinds of things authors need to think about when choosing who they want to work with. Looking at previous projects is an important one &#8211; not just whether the work is in a similar genre to your own work, but how you feel about the work that came out of the collaboration, whether you like the text after editing or like the cover design.</p>
<p>Authors should be totally honest about what they’re looking for from the freelancer. Not just because it’s important to make sure that expectations are clear all around, but to see how the freelancer responds. Collaborating with someone creatively can be intense, and it’s difficult to know how it’s going to go. Jumping in and being upfront about what you what (if you know what you want), or admitting your ignorance (if you don’t know what you need help with), can lead to a productive conversation. The earlier this happens, the better.</p>
<h2><strong>What else will Reedsy have coming up for authors?</strong></h2>
<p>Reedsy has a very specific purpose &#8211; to support independent authors. We’re building Reedsy like a toolbox. We’re starting with making something that can help with finding editors and designers. Naturally, we’ll add other professions over time &#8211; right now we’re planning to include publicists, narrators and translators.</p>
<p>But there are other tools we want to build for authors. The first of these is a text editor designed to support the process of creating book-length works, as well as making it more natural to share that work with your editor. We basically want to be more than a simple marketplace, and add value to the collaborations. This is why we’ll release the first set of project management tools in a few weeks only…</p>
<h2><strong>Would you consider having translators there too?</strong></h2>
<p>This should come in a month or two, yes. We’ll start with translators “into English” (not from), as we know many foreign authors wish to enter the US and UK markets but are unsure where to start… And also because translating is actually that: just a start! The book then needs to be copy-edited and/or proofread (in English), the cover needs to be modified (or redesigned), and the launch has to be accompanied by a marketing effort (in English).</p>
<p>On Reedsy, we already have all these resources (US/UK editors and designers), so foreign authors would access the full suite of services they need to really penetrate a new market. We’re going to be like Ellis Island for foreign authors arriving to the English-speaking market.</p>
<h2><strong>How can people find out more about Reedsy?</strong></h2>
<p>Our homepage &#8211; <a href="http://www.reedsy.com">www.reedsy.com</a> &#8211; would be a great start! If you’re an author, it’s free to sign up to the site and take a look around at who we have on the marketplace. If you’re a freelancer, it’s both free and very easy to build a profile and wait to be approached by authors. Reedsy is currently free during this beta stage, so there’s no reason not to take a look!</p>
<p>The other way of learning more is by asking us. We love the way the indie community supports itself, and we’re a part of that community. If you want a hand with anything, or want to know more, let us know and we’ll do what we can to help.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How David started writing</strong> in the 1980s and won a number of awards early on, as well as writing for many gaming and popular sci-fi properties plus green-lighting for Hollywood screenwriting. He started teaching and his students included Stephenie Meyer, James Dashner and Brandon Sanderson. His rules are that a project has to be fun and he has to be able to make some money at whatever he&#8217;s doing.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1614751765/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1614751765&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=WJNRKB5VNMCYUMDN"><img class="alignright wp-image-20538 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-19-at-1.30.09-pm-184x300.jpg" alt="million dollar outline" width="184" height="300" /></a>Writing the Million Dollar Outline</h2>
<ul>
<li>If it is your goal to write a bestselling novel, then you do need to consider certain principles. <strong>Write what you love but then figure out how to write for a wider audience than you started with</strong>. For example, old and young, male and female. The Harry Potter books clearly appeal to many different age groups.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transport your reader to another time and/or place.</strong> Generally speaking, the top 50 books and films of all time do this. We discuss the importance of length in this aspect – despite the recent move to shorter books, the biggest books of all time are doorstop size. You can use novellas over time to create &#8216;mega-novel&#8217; series though, and a lot of people are using this strategy, particularly in romance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>It must score high on the emotional Richter scale.</strong> It needs to impact people deeply and be remarkable so you get that word of mouth</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The word genre is really about emotions</strong> e.g. mystery = intrigue, thrillers = adventure, horror, comedy, fantasy &amp; sci-fi = wonder, romance = love. Nostalgia is another powerful emotion.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1614751749/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1614751749&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=KQVOOAGKAPCYM57S"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20539 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-19-at-1.30.28-pm-187x300.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2014-11-19 at 1.30.28 pm" width="187" height="300" /></a>Drawing on the power of resonance in writing</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resonance arouses an expectation that you&#8217;re going to like this type of book</strong>. Genre conventions are one aspect, cover design another, mentioning other books that people like is another. This is why similar tropes and characters are reused, as they have built in resonance. A good example was the recent Lego movie which was packed with resonance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This is not about plagiarism or re-using other material, but <strong>consciously choosing to riff off earlier ideas</strong>. David goes through the layers of resonance within Pirates of the Caribbean all the way back over centuries. You still have to be original, but add a twist on the past e.g. Meyer&#8217;s sparkly vampires.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Longevity and your career as a fiction writer</h2>
<ul>
<li>You have to be a good storyteller and be able to write well. <strong>There are a lot of skills you need to learn in order to be successful fiction author and it&#8217;s equivalent to getting a doctorate degree.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>It takes about 7 years to become &#8216;publishable&#8217; and another 7 years to become a bestselling author.</strong> To be one of the best, you have to take that onwards to the next level. <em>[I love this because I&#8217;ve been writing fiction for 4 years, so I am halfway through the apprenticeship!]</em> There are people who have some kind of special talent, but most great authors work really hard and practice over years.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On paying attention to dreams and writing them down</strong>. It&#8217;s your sub-conscious talking to you! David talks about his process, thinking about his plot before bed so he can dream about it that night and then write in the morning. Keep a notebook or computer handy at all times!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On fun and hard work as a writer. </strong>You have to consider your creative muse and not do the projects that don&#8217;t bring you alive. Figure out how to stay out of the ruts that the industry will try to put you in.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On author name and branding.</strong> Dave&#8217;s real name, Wolverton, put him on the bottom of shelves in bookstores so when he started writing, he changed to the name David Farland. That is less important in a digital market.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loving the craft is critical for longevity</strong>, or why would you bother! You can always learn something new so there is a sense of a career path ahead. Understanding the markets and being aware of what people want is critical.</li>
</ul>
<h2>On self-publishing</h2>
<ul>

But <strong>sometimes authors are publishing too early</strong> and are slightly delusional in terms of their ability and expectations of income. It&#8217;s a great way to publish, but you need to learn the craft and get critical feedback before you can expect success.</li>

	* How David started writing in the 1980s and won a number of awards early on, as well as writing for many gaming and popular sci-fi properties plus green-lighting for Hollywood screenwriting. He started teaching and his students included Stephenie Meyer, James Dashner and Brandon Sanderson. His rules are that a project has to be fun and he has to be able to make some money at whatever he's doing.

(http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-19-at-1.30.09-pm-184x300.jpg)Writing the Million Dollar Outline

	* If it is your goal to write a bestselling novel, then you do need to consider certain principles. Write what you love but then figure out how to write for a wider audience than you started with. For example, old and young, male and female. The Harry Potter books clearly appeal to many different age groups.


	* Transport your reader to another time and/or place. Generally speaking, the top 50 books and films of all time do this. We discuss the importance of length in this aspect – despite the recent move to shorter books, the biggest books of all time are doorstop size. You can use novellas over time to create 'mega-novel' series though, and a lot of people are using this strategy, particularly in romance.

<p>I started out with a <a title="business models for authors" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/07/25/creative-entrepreneur-business-models/" target="_blank">business model </a>of education through video courses, but now I focus more on books and sales through other online platforms.</p>
<h3>Well, now I&#8217;m biting the bullet and pulling down my courses. And it just so happens to coincide with Cyber Monday <img src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a<a title="eu vat change" href="http://onemanbandaccounting.co.uk/eu-vat-changes-2015/" target="_blank"> law change in the EU</a> which means I will have to do a ton more compliance paperwork if I keep selling direct from 1 Jan 2015, and because my intention was to stop doing these over time, this has just accelerated the change.</p>
<h2>So this really is your last chance to get these great courses!</h2>
<p>This is not one of those fake sales, it&#8217;s actually the end! And you can get <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>25% off by</strong></span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>using the voucher code: PENN </strong><span style="color: #000000;">when you check out.<strong>  </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The 25% code is valid until 12 noon UK time 31 Dec</strong>. If you purchase, there&#8217;s a money back guarantee if you aren&#8217;t happy, plus the courses will be available to view online for another 6 months as well as being downloadable so you can keep a copy for yourself.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>I love to learn, and I&#8217;ve been sharing what I learn on this blog for almost 6 years now!</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/anned/8700093610/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20571" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-24-at-12.29.15-pm-300x198.jpg" alt="still learning" width="450" height="298" /></a>I had an email from a lady the other week and she asked me, <strong>&#8220;How do you continue when things are tough?&#8221;</strong> This could be about writing, or just life in general, but for me, it&#8217;s about constantly learning from others and changing based on what I learn.</p>
<p>When I first started this site, my mentors were people making a full-time living online and the mindset of entrepreneurship &#8211; <a title="from affirmation to reality" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2011/09/12/creative-author/" target="_blank">which helped me escape my day job</a>.</p>
<p>Then I learned about writing books and non-fiction, and then about writing fiction and deeper creativity. I feel like I circle around these topics, learning new things from new people all the time. I devour books every week, writing copious notes in my many Moleskine notebooks. I&#8217;m a learning junkie, but I also try to put things into action, and this keeps me constantly motivated.</p>
<h2>There have been some key mentors in my life, but all their teaching has come from books, seminars and online programs, not from 1:1 discussion.</h2>
<p>These people put their knowledge out in multiple formats to help a broader spectrum at one time, and I now try to do the same. When people email me asking to be mentored, I say &#8216;go read my books, read this blog, listen to the podcasts, or come and hear me speak&#8217; that&#8217;s how I pass on the mentoring relationship. I hope you will do the same with what you learn.</p>
<p>Our mentors change over time, so I wanted to highlight some of mine at the moment.</p>
<h2>Robert McKee STORY conference</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060391685/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060391685&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=NKM4T6GWPEX2QFLN"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20568 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-24-at-12.06.53-pm-196x300.jpg" alt="story" width="196" height="300" /></a>I&#8217;ve just returned from the<a title="McKee STORY" href="http://mckeestory.com/" target="_blank"> 4 day intensive STORY course</a> taught by Robert McKee, and it was absolutely mind-blowing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve now written <a title="McKee STORY" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/books/" target="_blank">8 fiction books</a> &#8211; from short stories, to novellas and novels, and I felt that this was exactly the right time for me to learn what he had to teach. I was going to blog about what I learned but seriously, I have 130 pages of notes and it was way too deep to try and capture in sound-bites. I&#8217;m also going to be processing for a few weeks before trying to incorporate it all into my 2015 creative works. It&#8217;s not about screenwriting, so much as story itself and how that resonates through people for maximum human impact.</p>
<p>If you want to check out this stuff, <a title="McKee STORY" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060391685/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060391685&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=NKM4T6GWPEX2QFLN" target="_blank">read the book STORY</a>, and if you are serious about investing in your creative writing career, then take the <a title="McKee STORY" href="http://mckeestory.com/" target="_blank">multi-day seminar</a>. He also has an <a title="storylogue" href="http://www.storylogue.com/" target="_blank">online video program, Storylogue,</a> but to be honest, I think the live experience is far superior (but obviously more expensive!)</p>
<h2>Dean Wesley Smith &amp; Kristine Kathryn Rusch</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BI88VGI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BI88VGI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=OHG53GGTJAIF7SC7"><img class="alignright wp-image-20567 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-24-at-12.06.29-pm-191x300.jpg" alt="perfection" width="191" height="300" /></a>Dean and Kris have 30+ years as full-time writers and they&#8217;ve seen the full spectrum of what the publishing industry can offer &#8211; from trad pub deals, to indie, to owning their own publishing company and physical bookstore.</p>
<p>Their advice is completely devoid of any hype or short term tactics, it&#8217;s all about <strong>creating a long-term successful career</strong> as an author. They are also both prolific writers and incredibly humble, plus they&#8217;re fun, and seem to have a good marriage <img src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> What better mentors to have!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read all their various non-fiction books and taken a number of courses. The ones that have particularly helped me are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="pursuit of perfections" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BI88VGI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BI88VGI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=OHG53GGTJAIF7SC7" target="_blank">The Pursuit of Perfection and How It Harms Writers</a></li>
<li><a title="productivity workshop" href="http://www.deanwesleysmith.com/online-workshops/" target="_blank">Course on Productivity</a> &#8211; how to write more words per day, get more hours in the chair and get out of your own way.</li>
<li><a title="dean lectures" href="http://www.deanwesleysmith.com/lecture-series/" target="_blank">Paying the Price Lecture</a> &#8211; for those who take this writing life seriously and want to have longevity in the market</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steven Pressfield</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087TUM54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0087TUM54&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=Z7RLSTOZROPQKVI7"><img class="alignleft wp-image-13657 size-full" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/turningpro.jpg" alt="Turning Pro Steven Pressfield" width="191" height="286" /></a><a title="turning pro" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087TUM54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0087TUM54&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=Z7RLSTOZROPQKVI7" target="_blank">Turning Pro</a> is the only book I own in print, ebook and audiobook. Pressfield kicks my ass every time I read or listen to it, and I make sure to read it every January to assess whether or not I am closer to being a &#8216;pro.&#8217;</p>
<p>When<a title="steven pressfield podcast" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/06/18/steven-pressfield/" target="_blank"> I interviewed Steve earlier this year on my podcast</a>, it was a true pinnacle, because talking to someone who had been a mentor to me for years was very special. You&#8217;ll hear it in my voice &#8211; I am a little star-struck!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been listening to the <a title="audiobook turning pro" href="http://www.blackirishbooks.com/store/turning-pro/" target="_blank">audiobook of Turning Pro</a> in the last few weeks, trying to up my creative game. Pressfield&#8217;s books are really about mindset and what really matters, leaving behind the ephemeral to get to the heart of why we do what we do.</p>
<p>His quote from Krishna is particularly important to me right now:<strong> &#8220;You have the right to your labor, not the fruits of your labor.&#8221; </strong>Think on that before moaning about book sales!<strong><br />

<h2>Tony Robbins</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476757801/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1476757801&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=UOFVBLOYNKK67EIU"><img class="alignright wp-image-20558 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-19-at-2.47.10-pm-200x300.jpg" alt="money tony robbins" width="200" height="300" /></a>I&#8217;ve said before that I was so inspired by Tony&#8217;s self-help books and information that my aim was to become a professional speaker like him, and change people&#8217;s lives in the way he does. His book, <a title="awaken the giant within" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671791540/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0671791540&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=TEWO7MCVPZ7WYFOV" target="_blank">Awaken the Giant Within</a>, helped me to overcome a lot of mindset issues and start to create, another pivotal moment in my move from IT consultant to creativity. I&#8217;ve never been to one of his live events, although that is on my list for the next couple of years.</p>
<p>But Tony makes my list again at the moment because of his new book, <a title="money master the game" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476757801/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1476757801&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=UOFVBLOYNKK67EIU" target="_blank">Money: Master the Game</a>. It&#8217;s his first book in many years and comes from his anger over the 2008 global financial crisis and how the lack of financial education costs people far more than they could imagine. I consider myself a decent enough business-woman, but I have made my share of financial mistakes, both in business and in property. I&#8217;ve been reading this book slowly, and will continue to re-read until I understand it and have made the changes necessary to my own financial setup. It&#8217;s incredibly value packed and may change your life! I have bought the print edition as well as digital as it is the kind of book you need to digest slowly.</p>
<h2>Various podcasts</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-15030" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/smallpodcast.jpg" alt="podcast" width="133" height="126" />I listen to podcasts when I do chores or go to the gym, or travel and I find it&#8217;s a great way to learn about new things and discover lessons learned from people in all walks of life. I&#8217;m loving the <a title="tim ferriss podcast" href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/" target="_blank">Tim Ferriss show</a> at the moment and particularly enjoyed this <a title="kevin kelly" href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/08/29/kevin-kelly/" target="_blank">episode with Kevin Kelly</a>. I also like the <a title="james altucher show" href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/category/thejamesaltuchershow/" target="_blank">James Altucher show</a>, particularly <a title="altucher adams" href="http://www.stansberryradio.com/James-Altucher/Latest-Episodes/Episode/736/Ep-47-Scott-Adams-The-Secret-to-Dilbert-s-Success" target="_blank">this episode with Scott Adams, of Dilbert fame</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of self-publishing and related topics, I also listen to the <a title="self publishing podcast" href="https://selfpublishingpodcast.com/" target="_blank">Self-Publishing Podcast</a> (for laughs NSFW), the <a title="sell more books show" href="http://sellmorebooksshow.com/" target="_blank">Sell More Books show</a> (for news and marketing tips), the <a title="rocking self publishing podcast" href="http://rockingselfpublishing.com/" target="_blank">Rocking Self Publishing Podcast </a>(for deeper interviews with top self-publishers), and I&#8217;ve just started listening to<a title="the author biz" href="http://theauthorbiz.com/" target="_blank"> the Author Biz</a>, about author-entrepreneurship.</p>
<h2>Put away your self-development inner cynic!</h2>
<p>I hope I don&#8217;t have too many cynics in my audience &#8211; after all, my relentless positivity would probably put you off over time! The world I live is in brimming with possibilities and exciting projects and a never-ending stream of learning and creating. If your world doesn&#8217;t feel that way, then you need a kick in the creative rear!</p>
<p>These are just a few of my mentors at the moment who help me push the boundaries of what I can achieve in my week, my year and my life. You will need to find your own mentors for what you need to learn, but DO find them. After all, if you&#8217;re the smartest person in the room, you&#8217;re in the wrong room!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">I&#8217;d love to hear about some of your mentors, now or in the past, preferably from books/seminars/courses so others can benefit. Please do leave a comment below and join the conversation.</span></h3>
