				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From GigaOm:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ebooks are feeling a bit hungover heading into the new year. The <em>50 Shades of Grey</em> exuberance of 2011 and 2012 feels long ago. The first seemingly viable ebook subscription services launched at the end of 2013 (Scribd, Oyster) and Amazon launched its own ebook subscription service, Kindle Unlimited, mid-2014.</p>
<p>The main difference between Kindle Unlimited and Scribd and Oyster — all of which cost around $10 a month — is that Kindle Unlimited has way fewer books that people have heard of. That’s because Scribd and Oyster have been able to attract big-5 publishers (HarperCollins, Simon &amp; Schuster, likely soon Macmillan) that hope to shake Amazon’s dominance in the ebook market, so they see no reason to make their books available on Kindle Unlimited.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Smashwords lets its authors distribute their books to Scribd and Oyster. Coker mentions Kindle Unlimited, too:</p>
<blockquote id="quote-our-broad-distributi"><p>“Our broad distribution network helped authors and publishers diversify their exposure to an industry-wide slowdown in ebook retailing…Authors who fully distributed their titles with Smashwords were partially insulated from the dramatic sales drops many Amazon authors reported following the introduction of Kindle Unlimited.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Coker obviously doesn’t mention the word “glut,” though it certainly could be a caption for the chart above. In 2015 we’ll have to see whether “glut” largely continues to be seen as a Kindle Unlimited problem. But if more people aren’t buying and reading more books, it will be a problem for most authors and for all ebook subscription services.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Today marks the beginning of the new European Union VAT requirements. As an EU resident, I’m required to verify that any online vendors I work with are VAT compliant. Amazon is. Audible is. Smashwords… isn’t, and the only public announcement they’ve made on the topic is that they are not currently planning any changes to their web site.</p>
<p>Until that changes, my self-published fiction is no longer available for sale on Smashwords. Because Smashwords will not distribute to Kobo, iTunes or Barnes &amp; Noble unless my work is available in their store, my work will soon be disappearing from those venues, too.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From author Jake Kerr:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the single most misunderstood developments in the publishing world is the various book subscription services: Oyster, Scribd, and, especially, Kindle Unlimited. This has led to widespread misinformation on everything from their economics to their impact on authors. Let’s take a look at the whole structure and see if we can provide a bit more clarity.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>For the user, a subscription only makes sense if they save money. There is simply no other reason to embrace a subscription model when direct sales still exist (as is the case for practically all these services).</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>So if this is great for the consumer why would a business embrace this model? Well, the answer is that you are sacrificing profit on a small group to sell to a larger group, making more money in the process. If the average existing user saved 30% via the subscription model, if you increase your user base by 40% then you are making more money.</p>
<p>In short, the underlying assumption of the subscription model is that pent up demand is significantly constrained by pricing. Of course, you can just drop your price across the board, but that ignores an important point: Subscription models can live alongside direct retail models. So just lowering the price makes no sense, since you could conceivably sell at a higher margin to some of these people, having the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>This underlying concept of the subscription model is critical for authors: If you cannot gain a greater percentage of readers generating new revenue than the revenue you are losing in the price cut, then this is a bad deal.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>One of the things you hear in the publishing industry are horror stories about musicians making pennies from services like Spotify. This is used as a dire warning of what Kindle Unlimited can do. However, the music industry is different in a lot of ways. Hit songs get played by individual subscribers over and over and over again. Each play generates a small amount of money. If each play were paid the same as a sale, then subscription services would quickly go bankrupt. Music is also split between performance and song-writing royalties. If you think Amazon is screwing writers, think about what musicians get from airplay on terrestrial radio. You know how much that is? Zero. Each time you hear an Andy Summers riff from The Police on the radio, he gets nothing. Because broadcast radio doesn’t have a performance royalty. Sting, however, gets royalties, because he is the songwriter.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Back to subscriptions, despite these differences, the actual core economics are the same. You have a set revenue number per subscriber, and people are drawn to “hits,” which will suck up the majority of the money. For Spotify, if the average listener listens to 100 songs a month for their $9.99 subscription fee, that means that each play will generate 10 cents. That 10 cents will also have to be split among the publisher and the performers. Now imagine that 90 of those plays are for “Blank Space” by Taylor Swift. That means that there is only a single dollar to be split by everyone else. Of course, if listeners actually listen to 1,000 songs a month, that’s a penny per play and most likely means more artists are getting paid (albeit less per play).</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Mark Coker:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before I speculate about what 2015 holds for authors and publishers, let’s reflect for a moment about how self publishing has transformed the book publishing landscape.</p>
<p>Thanks to ebook self publishing, every writer in the world has democratized access to the tools and knowledge of professional publishing.  It&#8217;s now possible for writers to make their books instantly accessible, discoverable and affordable to billions of readers around the world.</p>
<p>Most exciting of all, we&#8217;re still in the early days of the ebook self publishing revolution.  I&#8217;m confident that decades from now, ebook self publishing will be viewed by historians as no less transformative than the advent of the Gutenberg printing press.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p><b>1.  More authors will aspire to publish indie</b> – In 2008 when I founded Smashwords, nearly all writers aspired to traditionally publish.  Self-publishing was viewed as the option of last resort – the option for failed writers.  Today the former stigma of self publishing is evaporating.  Indie authorship has become a global cultural movement, as I described when I published the <i>Indie Author Manifesto</i> earlier this year. The indie author movement will grow stronger in 2015.  Traditionally published authors will continue to transition to indie, led by midlist authors.  We’ll also see more hybrid authors reorient their publishing strategy back in the direction of indieville.</p>
<p><b>2.  Indie authors will capture more ebook market share</b> – The percentage of reader dollars going to indie ebooks will increase.  The growth will be fueled by a continued increase in the number of indie-published ebooks, and by more indie authors adopting best practices to publish with greater pride and professionalism.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p><b>5.  Indie authors face increased competition from traditional publishers</b> – For the first years of the ebook revolution, large publishers all but ceded the $4.99 and lower ebook market to indie authors.  Publishers tried to maintain higher prices, and indies – empowered with the ability to earn royalty rates of 60-80% list price &#8211;  offered budget-conscious consumers high-quality books at low prices.  The low prices, including the ultralow prices of FREE and .99, made it easier for readers to take a chance on unknown writers.</p>
<p>In the last year, large publishers, borrowing a page from the indie author playbook, have stepped up their price-cutting in the form of temporary promotions on titles from big-name authors.  In 2015 we’ll see the temporary promotions from large publishers that were so common in 2014 give way to permanent lower prices on backlist titles from big names, and faster, more aggressive discounting on recently released titles.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From The New Yorker:</p>
<blockquote><p>This month, the author Michael Moorcock celebrated his seventy-fifth birthday, which, as fate would have it, fell in the same month that Peter Jackson closed out his hexology of films that began with “Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship the Ring” and ended with “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.” The latter is the third part of Jackson’s “The Hobbit” sequence, a book once considered a delightful fable that has been torn asunder to make its story fit in with the vast continuity of the earlier films, while also trying to honor every one of J. R. R. Tolkien’s footnotes, appendices, and letters. The films are astonishing Hollywood spectacles, and for those of us who grew up reading the books and playing elves in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, it was a thrill seeing those characters realized on screen. Gollum and Sauron and Aragorn were drawn from mythic tropes but are now so integral to science-fiction and fantasy culture that they have become tropes themselves. But Moorcock, one of the most prolific living fantasists, sees Tolkien’s creation as little more than a conservative vision of the status quo, an adventure that brings its hero “There and Back Again,” rather than into a world where experience means you can’t go home again. Moorcock thinks Tolkien’s vast catalogue of names, places, magic rings, and dwarven kings is, as he told Hari Kunzru in a 2011 piece for <i>The Guardian</i>, “a pernicious confirmation of the values of a morally bankrupt middle class.”</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>It is also a lovely irony that it was fifty years ago this year that Moorcock, then twenty-four years old, was offered the editorial helm of the British magazine<i>New Worlds</i>. It was there that the young editor called foul on the old guard of science fiction and fantasy by publishing writers who—with a counterculture fire under their feet—changed the very course of science fiction and fantasy: J. G. Ballard, Roger Zelazny, and Samuel R. Delany, to name a few. It was also here that Moorcock gave a platform for some of the most insightful critiques of Tolkien’s vast influence.</p>
<p>Moorcock and his peers had become tired of the dominant science-fiction landscape: vast fields of time travel, machismo, and spaceships, as well as the beefcake heroes of the fantasy subgenre “Sword and Sorcery.” The Golden Age of Science Fiction, held aloft by authors like Frederik Phol, John W. Campbell, and Robert Heinlein had, by the nineteen-sixties, sputtered out into a recycling of the same ideas. Within the pages of <i>New Worlds</i>, Moorcock created a literary revolution, one that would have science fiction fans calling for his head. It would be termed New Wave, and it was characterized by an insistence that speculative fiction doesn’t need to rely on laser blasters, one-eyed Martians, and sub-light engines to expand its imagination. The stories in <i>New Worlds</i> under Moorcock were often experimental, sometimes pushing the boundaries of what some considered good taste. His first editorial, titled “A New Literature for the Space Age,” set the bar high:</p>
<blockquote><p>More and more people are turning away from the fast-stagnating pool of the conventional novel — and they are turning to science fiction (or speculative fantasy). This is a sign, among others, that a popular literary renaissance is around the corner. Together, we can accelerate that renaissance.</p></blockquote>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Because Moorcock is a fiction writer, it was only fitting that he would offer a critique of Tolkien through his own work. In the nineteen-seventies, swimming in the shadows like a remora alongside Tolkien’s legacy, was a hero of sorts with a slightly darker nature than that of Bilbo or Gandalf. His name is Elric, a frail, drug-addicted albino and the reluctant ruler of the kingdom of Melniboné, where revenge and hedonism are abiding characteristics, and human beings are enslaved. The inhabitants of Melniboné are not the spiritual, almost angelic elves of Lothlórien, but a race of decadent autocrats whose magical gifts are bestowed by demons. While Elric loves his people, he despises their selfishness, and the stories and novels follow Elric across strange lands and times as he tries to come to terms with his own internal struggle with his companion, Stormbringer, a sentient sword that feeds off the souls of those Elric kills.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From veteran publishing consultant Mike Shatzkin:</p>
<blockquote><p>The year ends with a front-page New York Times story reporting the consternation in the indie author community at the current state of their commercial lives at Amazon. The proximate cause of distress is seen to be the Amazon Kindle Unlimited subscription service, through which indie authors are receiving considerably less compensation per read than they get through a sale, combined with the apparent migration of many Kindle readers to subscription, which would also explain the simultaneous sharp decline in those authors’ single-copy sales. Indie author and author service-provider Bob Mayer is quoted in the piece describing a complete turnaround in the past six months, with authors going from what they thought were secure incomes from writing to looking for day jobs.</p>
<p>Nate Hoffelder at Digital Reader makes the point that we’d want to know whether it is just the indie authors feeling this pain or whether publishers are seeing revenues shrink too. But that’s a very difficult comparison to make. Amazon gets the attractive books from the big non-agency publishers by just buying them for each use (paying whatever is the publisher’s wholesale price). Amazon wins that way because they don’t have to get the publisher’s permission to participate in the subscription program, but they’re paying a lot more for each subscriber read than they pay the indies. So even if the reader balance shifts from “individual purchase” to subscription read”, the publisher wouldn’t lose income.</p>
<p>My hunch is that the indie author community has a much more serious and intractable problem. It’s called supply and demand.</p>
<p>What a long list of indie authors has proven in the years since Kindle was invented is that there is a substantial market willing to try storytelling from unknown writers if it is offered at a relatively low price.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>What is now being proven is that market is not infinitely elastic. Most of the data we see suggest that ebook sales growth has stopped. (As Mayer says in the piece, many ebook readers have an inventory of ebooks they’ve bought and not yet read.) Ever-growing supply and stable demand is a toxic formula for the prospects of each successive ebook published for that market. My own hunch is that Kindle Unlimited is simply the straw that broke the camel’s back.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From author Steven Konkoly:</p>
<blockquote><p>I want to take a few moments to explore a critical strategy for navigating the new Indie publishing landscape. <strong>Diversification</strong>.</p>
<p>There’s little doubt that the e-book landscape has changed. From the weakening impact of popular promotional services (if you can even get selected for one of the major services) to a softening of the traditional Indie pricing advantage, most Indies (big and small) have reported a decline in e-book sales and revenue. The launch of Kindle Unlimited remains a key suspect in 2nd half 2014 declines, ironically affecting authors that had taken steps to shield their book portfolios from Amazon by taking their books out of Kindle Select.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>As I sit down to create my 2015 business goals, I look back at 2014, and wonder how I can replicate the year’s sales numbers? Financially, 2014 represented my best year as a writer, and it had little to do with ebooks. That’s not exactly true. <em><strong>It had less to do with ebooks, and more to do with treating the novels as fully exploitable property.</strong> <strong>It also had to do with seeking completely different opportunities, some of which represented a bit of a risk. </strong></em></p>
<p>Before I talk strategies, here’s a brief recap of the basic numbers, which you might find surprising. I certainly did:</p>
<p><strong>Ebook unit sales were down 28.7% in 2014, over 2013—With the addition of 4 relatively successful titles!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Income across all sources was up 51% in 2014 from 2013.</strong></p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p><strong>I raised the prices of all of my titles, </strong>and saw an immediate impact on revenue without a drop in units. I had always hovered in the $3.99 range, with $4.99 the going price for a new release. I bumped that up a dollar in each category. Nothing earth shattering, but it made a difference. I don’t know if these prices will be sustainable in 2015, with the advent of subscription reader services and lower priced “big name” offerings.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p><strong>Audiobooks saved 2014. </strong>I sold nearly 9,000 audiobooks in 2014, most of them in the post-apocalyptic genre, and most of them through pay-per-production deals through ACX. I can’t understate the importance of analyzing your genre and seeing if audiobooks are profitable. My thriller audiobooks (Black Flagged Series) are on a 14 month investment recuperation schedule. I can live with that. My goal is to create viable, long-term income streams. However, my post-apocalyptic (PA) audiobooks earn out within a month, sometimes less than that. Another strong argument for sticking with the post-apocalyptic genre. I won’t hesitate to produce all of my books in 2015.</p></blockquote>
