</p></blockquote>
<p>I waited seven years to do this. I read dozens of books and wasted hours upon hours every week meeting with people, trying to learn this simple secret. It was the answer to the question my heart was asking. Maybe you’re asking it, too.</p>
<div id="attachment_15653" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="Professional Writer"><img class="size-large wp-image-15653" src="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/become-writer-630x351.png" alt="Professional Writer" width="630" height="351" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://my.leadpages.net/leadbox/14205d473f72a2%3A1245e56aeb46dc/5762957321437184/" target="_blank">Click here</a><script src="//my.leadpages.net/leadbox-808.js" type="text/javascript" data-leadbox="14205d473f72a2:1245e56aeb46dc" data-url="https://my.leadpages.net/leadbox/14205d473f72a2%3A1245e56aeb46dc/5762957321437184/" data-config="%7B%7D"></script>to watch my free video series.</p></div>
<p><em>Do I have what it takes?</em></p>
<p>Every writer struggles with this. In fact, every person grapples with it on some level. It’s not just a creative struggle, but a human one. We all are wondering if what we are made of is enough. Can we really survive this trauma, this struggle, this current trial – whatever it may be?</p>
<p>The answer, though, is not something you can find out there, in the world. It’s something you must grapple with from within. It’s a question only you can answer. And for the longest time, I misunderstood this.</p>
<h3>My awakening</h3>
<p>When I was starting out a few years ago as a blogger, I had a few conversations that changed my life. Even though this question your heart is asking is one you know the answer to, you will find guides along the way. These were mine.</p>
<p><strong>CONVERSATION #1:</strong> In an interview, Steven Pressfield told me that a writer becomes a writer “when he says he is.” It doesn’t matter what other people think. It matters what <em>you</em> think, what you believe about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>CONVERSATION #2:</strong> A few months later, I was having a conversation with my friend Paul and he asked me what my dream was. I told him I didn’t have any, and he looked surprised.</p>
<p>“Really? Because I would’ve thought your dream was to be a writer.”</p>
<p>“Well,” I said. “Yeah, I guess I’d like to be a writer… some day.”</p>
<p>“Jeff,” he said. “You don’t have to want to be a writer. You are a writer. You just need to write.”</p>
<p>That was all it took for me to get started. And what happened next was nothing short of extraordinary:</p>
<ul>
<li>I <strong>launched a blog</strong> which had over 50,000 monthly readers by the end of the first year.</li>
<li>The next year, I <strong>replaced my wife’s income</strong>, and a few months later replaced my own.</li>
<li>A few months after that, I <strong>quit my job</strong> and became a <a href="http://goinswriter.com/turn-pro/">professional writer</a> and never looked back.</li>
</ul>
<p>It sounds like it happened so fast, but really the process took about nine years – seven years of waiting and two years of finally doing the work. But all of this knowledge is worthless without understanding one simple principle.</p>

<h3>The Activity-Identity Principle</h3>
<p>I don’t know why, but when I started calling myself a writer, everything changed.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because now that I was owning my identity, I felt pressured to live into it. Or maybe we are all waiting to become who we really are. Regardless, I now believe in a very simple but powerful principle:</p>
<p><strong>Activity always follows identity. </strong></p>
<p>This, I think, is the reason behind most people’s struggles. And it’s the secret to breakthrough in your career, your goals, and your life. Before you can do something, you have to become someone.</p>
<p>But where, exactly, do you begin?</p>
<p>Start with your words, with the everyday things you say (or think) about yourself. In the words of Mr. Pressfield, “You are when you say you are.” And that, as simple, as it sounds, just might be the answer.</p>
<h3>Here’s your challenge (and a free video series)</h3>
<p>If you’ve read my blog for some time, you’re probably not unfamiliar with this story or even this idea of owning your identity. Because of the impact it’s had on my life, I’ve written about it many times.</p>
<p>But just because you’ve heard this doesn’t mean you’ve applied it, right? Often, it’s the most familiar things that we take for granted the most.</p>
<p>So if you’re reading this and feeling a little uncomfortable, maybe that’s a prompting. Maybe it’s time for you to take a significant step towards changing your life. Maybe it’s time to become yourself.</p>
<p>Here’s what I want you to do. Try this out. If you were like me, wondering when you would have permission to start writing, why not do what I did, what my friend made me do?</p>
<p><strong>Call yourself a writer.</strong> And watch your confidence grow. Slowly, you will begin to believe more in yourself, and your competence will increase. It&#8217;s a mysterious but beautiful process. As you declare these things to be true, you are becoming more that person.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in, go watch the <a href="https://my.leadpages.net/leadbox/14205d473f72a2%3A1245e56aeb46dc/5762957321437184/" target="_blank">first video in my three-part series</a> on the questions every writer must ask. <a href="https://my.leadpages.net/leadbox/14205d473f72a2%3A1245e56aeb46dc/5762957321437184/" target="_blank">Click here to leave a comment, declaring you&#8217;re a writer</a><script src="//my.leadpages.net/leadbox-808.js" type="text/javascript" data-leadbox="14205d473f72a2:1245e56aeb46dc" data-url="https://my.leadpages.net/leadbox/14205d473f72a2%3A1245e56aeb46dc/5762957321437184/" data-config="%7B%7D"></script>.</p>

<p>In this episode of <a href="http://goinswriter.com/itunes" target="_blank">The Portfolio Life</a>, my co-host <a href="http://www.takepermission.com/" target="_blank">Andy Traub</a> and I talk about creating wow experiences for people and what it really takes to exceed expectations.</p>
<p>The idea of this show is this:<strong> </strong>Go beyond what is expected, do a little bit more than status quo, to make a difference in someone&#8217;s life.<strong> </strong>Being generous isn&#8217;t always about grand gestures. Doing small things on a consistent basis is all it takes to blow people away.</p>
<p>As you listen to this week&#8217;s episode of the podcast, I hope you are encouraged to make a difference in someone&#8217;s life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was the one thing everyone seemed to say. The crucial piece of advice that I was hesitant to take. And as great as it was, it just wasn’t enough.</p>
<div id="attachment_15498" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-15498" src="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/best-blog-advice-630x421.jpg" alt="Best blog advice" width="630" height="421" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/25533361@N00/280882501/">gatogrunge</a> via <a href="http://compfight.com">Compfight</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>
<p>“Just get started.”</p>
<p>This was what all my friends with successsful blogs had told me. It was the holy grail of advice. If I could just begin, they reasoned, then I would find my way.</p>
<p>The problem was I had already done that eight times before. And it just didn’t work.</p>
<h3>Why starting isn’t enough</h3>
<p>There’s something to be said about starting. It’s the place where we all begin. And I’m definitely a fan of not waiting for perfection and just getting on with the work you know you need to do.</p>
<p>But is that enough to succeed? Not quite.</p>
<p>After seven years of trying and failing and then two years of finally figuring it out, I’ve realized that starting is just, well, the start.</p>
<p>If you’re going to share your message with the world, if you’re going to build a blog that matters, you’re going to have to get intentional.</p>
<h3>Three keys to blogging success</h3>
<p>Recently, I released three free video trainings on what I’ve learned from building an online audience of 100,000 people. This was a process that took less than two years, and since then, I’ve taught over 2000 people to do the same.</p>
<p>And now I’m sharing these secrets with you.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve learned (click the links below to watch the videos which are all now available for a limited time):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://goinswriter.com/intentional-blog-video1">Find your voice</a>.</strong> This is the one thing that only you can provide, your unique perspective and way of viewing the world. Learning how to share it is an essential skill.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://goinswriter.com/intentional-blog-video2">Combine passion with need</a>.</strong> It’s not enough to have a dream. You need demand. People must want what you have to offer and actually value it. Otherwise, you only have a hobby.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://goinswriter.com/intentional-blog-video3">Help people</a>.</strong> Some say it’s not who you know but who knows you. But I think it goes deeper than that: it’s not who you know, it’s who you help. Being resourceful is the absolute best way to build an audience.</li>
</ol>
<h3>An opportunity to go deeper</h3>
<p>If you’d like to learn more about this and have a chance to work directly with me, I want to encourage you to check out my new course, <a href="http://intentionalblog.com">Intentional Blog</a>.</p>
<p>This is an A-to-Z course on all things you need to know to start and build a powerful blog. With over 30 step-by-step video tutorials, I share everything I’ve learned in the past decade of training bloggers to succeed and doing it myself.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever thought about starting a blog or have struggled with building an online audience and wondered what the secret was, this <a href="http://intentionalblog.com" title="Intentional Blog" target="_blank">course</a> is for you.</p>
<p>The course will only be available at a 50% discount for first-time students until <strong>11:59 p.m. CT on Wednesday, Nov. 26</strong>. After that, registration will close and the price will go up. I’m also offering exclusive group coaching calls with this first class. </p>
<p>So you won&#8217;t want to miss it. I&#8217;d love to work with you. You can find out more by clicking below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone seems to be complaining about Facebook these days. Too many ads. Too much clutter. Too little interaction with the people you want to reach. But what if Facebook wasn&#8217;t the problem? What if you were?</p>
<p><a href="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/PL_Header_Ep-032_1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15462" src="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/PL_Header_Ep-032_1-630x349.png" alt="032: Facebook Isn't the Problem — You Are: Interview with Joshua Becker [Podcast]" width="630" height="349" /></a>Mark Zuckerberg and company have given us an opportunity. An opportunity to reach people and interact with others. And maybe it&#8217;s up to us to make the most of it.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s face it. Facebook is a busy place with lots of people vying for your attention. So is it really possible to stand out and get noticed in the crowd? I brought that question to someone I consider an expert on the subject.</p>
<p>In this episode of <a href="http://goinswriter.com/itunes" target="_blank">The Portfolio Life</a>, Joshua Becker shares his specific formula for using Facebook to reach more people. If you&#8217;re a content creator or just someone who wants to reach and help more people on the largest social network in the world, you won&#8217;t want to miss it.</p>

<h3>About my guest</h3>
<p>Joshua Becker is the founder of the super popular blog <a href="http://www.becomingminimalist.com/" target="_blank">Becoming Minimalist</a>. He&#8217;s also a good friend and incredibly nice guy (last time we hung out together, he bought everyone&#8217;s lunch).</p>
<p>In less than three years, Joshua followed a few simple strategies that took his Facebook page from 4,000 likes to over 190,000 likes. He describes being on Facebook as a small storefront in the middle of Times Square. It&#8217;s busy, crowded, and filled with people. You have an opportunity to connect with people.</p>
<p>But how do you stand out and be seen? His advice was simple:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Give people the content they are interested in seeing.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Simple, but not so easy. How do you know what people want? And how do you give Facebook the kind of content that it thinks people want? You have to find out what people want to see and then deliver that content to them in a way that resonates.</p>
<p>His basic process is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Post consistently to your page (a few times per day).</li>
<li>Share relevant links with good descriptions and images.</li>
<li>Use interesting images that people can immediately connect with (image quotes work well).</li>
</ol>
<p>Following these principles that Joshua lays out in our interview will give you better engagement results with Facebook. I know, because I&#8217;ve started following his advice and have seen unexpected growth in my own <a title="Jeff Goins on Facebook" href="http://facebook.com/goinswriter" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.</p>
<h3> Interview highlights</h3>
<p>In this interview, Joshua and I talk about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The switch Joshua made in how he viewed Facebook and why it made all the difference.</li>
<li>The specific formula Joshua follows (and that I have started following) for posting on Facebook.</li>
<li>How to get out of a rut when your engagement declines.</li>
<li>His thoughts on Facebook ads (and why he rarely uses them).</li>
<li>How Facebook rewards people who are posting great content and penalizes those who don&#8217;t.</li>
<li>And a lot more!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resources mentioned</h3>
<p>Joshua shared some important resources, including where to find free, high-quality photos, and how to edit them. Here are some resources to check out:</p>

<p>There are plenty of people out there who are trying to do things they love and aren&#8217;t necessarily succeeding. So what are they missing? The truth is that passion is only one of <em>three</em> characteristics you need to find your <a title="Find Your Calling" href="http://goinswriter.com/calling/" target="_blank">calling</a>.</p>
<div class="special">Watch me explain this in a free video series: <a title="Intentional Blog Video" href="http://goinswriter.com/intentional-blog-video1" target="_blank">Why Passion Is Not Enough</a>.</div>
<h3>Demand, competency, passion</h3>
<p>When I&#8217;m working with my students or workshop attendees, I walk them through an exercise in which I ask them to answer three important questions. If you want to <a title="Intentional Blog" href="http://goinswriter.com/intentional-blog-video1" target="_blank">build a blog</a> that people actually read, make a living doing what you love, or launch a business that succeeds, you&#8217;ll have to answer them, too. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do people want?</li>
<li>What am I good at?</li>
<li>What do I love doing?</li>
</ul>
<p>Where these three questions converge is where you&#8217;ll find your &#8220;sweet spot.&#8221; As Frederick Buechner wrote, your vocation lies in the intersection of the world&#8217;s deep need and your deep joy.</p>
<p>In other words, you have to do something that is both interesting to you and that other people are interested in. And of course, you have to be good (quality is assumed). These questions cover the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demand:</strong> what the world needs or what the market wants.</li>
<li><strong>Competency:</strong> what skill or ability you offer to meet that demand.</li>
<li><strong>Passion:</strong> the enjoyment you get from the work you do.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have only one or two of these but not all three, you won&#8217;t make it. Competency without passion is drudge work. And passion without demand is a hobby. You have to have all three to make a meaningful contribution.</p>
<p>But of course, that&#8217;s not to say there isn&#8217;t value in doing things you love. I have lots of hobbies I enjoy. I just don&#8217;t expect people to pay me for them.</p>
<p>And neither should you.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s in it for them?</h3>
<p>If you want to get the most satisfaction out of your work and make the most meaningful contribution, you have to move beyond just what you&#8217;re passionate about. You have to consider what&#8217;s in it for other people.</p>
<p>This is not such a bad thing, actually. Earning the right to share your dream means you value people&#8217;s time. It means you actually care about someone other than yourself. But what does that look like, practically?</p>
<p>Here are three simple steps you can take today:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ask good questions.</strong> How else are you going to figure out what people want? You discover demand when you find out what others are struggling with.</li>
<li><strong>Share what you know.</strong> The best way to figure out what you&#8217;re good at and what value you can offer the world is to share what seems natural and obvious to you and see what resonates with others.</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to what gets you excited.</strong> See how what you share connects with other people and how that affects you. Do you get excited when you teach? Does it drain you to speak in front of people? Take notice of what lights you up and find ways to do more of those things.</li>
</ol>
<p>No, passion is not enough. The world needs more than for you to just do what you love. It needs you to make a difference. And each of these steps will help you figure out what people want, how you can deliver value, and what it takes to make that work both fulfilling and satisfying.</p>
<p>So you had better get started.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> I&#8217;m not sure who first originated this demand-competency-passion model, but lots of folks have addressed it in different ways. I know for a fact that <a href="http://99u.com/articles/7003/finding-your-work-sweet-spot-genuine-interest-skills-opportunity" target="_blank">Scott Belsky</a> and <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/job-satisfaction.html" target="_blank">Michael Hyatt</a> have both written and spoken about it.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>What do you do? </em>It&#8217;s a common question. And it seems like the answer should be easy enough. But it doesn&#8217;t always feel so simple. Many of us struggle with answering that very question.</p>
<p><a href="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/031_Graphic_1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15401 size-large" src="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/031_Graphic_1-630x349.png" alt="031: The Importance of Being Your True Self [Podcast]" width="630" height="349" /></a></p>
<p>Sometimes the thing we are doing or the job title we hold doesn&#8217;t encompass who we fully are. Sometimes, our dream looks different than our day job. And the truth is we are more than what we do. We are not just one thing. Which is where the struggle comes in.</p>
<p>In this episode of <a href="http://goinswriter.com/itunes" target="_blank">The Portfolio Life</a>, my co-host <a href="http://www.takepermission.com/" target="_blank">Andy Traub</a> and I discuss the importance of owning who you are, even when it feels risky.</p>
<h3>Listen to the podcast</h3>

<p>Listen in as we talk about practical and profound ways to own who you really are. And as usual Andy and I share a couple predictions for the future.</p>
<h3>What we don&#8217;t say (and why it matters)</h3>
<p>Sometimes, people won&#8217;t admit who they are. They&#8217;ll hem and haw and stammer, waiting for permission to be their true selves. I know this, because I was this way (still am sometimes). And I can tell you: it is an utter waste of time.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the essence of the episode in a short statement:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The things you neglect to say about yourself say as much, if not more, than the things you really do say. </em>[<a href="http://ctt.ec/GtQe_" target="_blank">Tweet that</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, what you are afraid to admit about yourself just might be an indicator of exactly who you are.</p>
<p>On the show, we talk more about this fear of becoming ourselves and how we shouldn&#8217;t ignore it. Instead, we ought to realize that in the midst of this fear lie some of our greatest assets.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t spend your life hiding behind the facade of a fake self. Be your true self &#8212; you&#8217;ll be happier, more successful, and live a better life. [<a href="http://ctt.ec/mV8K6" target="_blank">Tweet that</a>]</p>
<p>As you listen to this week&#8217;s episode of the podcast, I hope you&#8217;ll find encouragement to be your true self, even when it feels risky.</p>

<div class="special">I wanted to remind you about Jeff Walker&#8217;s video series on how to do online product launches. I highly recommend this free video series.

I can honestly say this is the best stuff I&#8217;ve ever seen on the subject of launches.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em>The only way to find your voice is to use it.</em><br />
<strong>—Austin Kleon</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The hardest decisions we face are the ones that can&#8217;t be made without you &#8212; in other words, the important stuff that often doesn&#8217;t feel urgent.</p>
<p><a href="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/CourageousWork_1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15340" src="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/CourageousWork_1-630x349.png" alt="The Courageous Decision to Show Your Work" width="630" height="349" /></a></p>
<p>Like taking your spouse out to dinner for no reason at all. Or showing that coworker how much you appreciate her. Even deciding to hit &#8220;publish&#8221; on a blog post.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re the decisions that if you don&#8217;t make them no one notices but you. It&#8217;s the choice to leave your job when you think it&#8217;s time, despite the fact that everyone says you do great work. It&#8217;s the choice to launch an important project when there is plenty of email to answer.</p>
<p>These are the decisions that shape us, that shape our world and affect our future. They&#8217;re not easy decisions to make, but they are important.</p>
<h3>The better of two goods</h3>
<p>Often, it might feel like choosing between two pretty good options. But in your heart you know which one is right. The life of an artist is full of moments like this. Moments where the only wrong choice is to not move forward, to stagnate.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say what this means for you. For me, it means hanging onto a project far longer than I should. It means starting something (or finishing it) before I feel ready. It&#8217;s learning to trust my gut, obey my instinct, and listen to the spirit inside that says, &#8220;It&#8217;s time.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the most important decisions I made happened three years ago. It was the decision to start calling myself a writer. When I did this, all kinds of crazy things started happening. The most amazing one was this: I finally began to believe I was a writer.</p>
<p>And as a result, I began to act like it, publishing and sharing my work.</p>
<p>Eventually, the world started to take notice. Publishers, agents, and editors were now asking me to write. Instead of me going to them, the gatekeepers were showing up at my doorstep, which was, admittedly, weird. But I&#8217;ve learned to embrace the lesson in this experience.</p>
<p>In the words of Maya Angelou, &#8220;Nothing works until you do.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Daily decisions make a difference</h3>
<p>Now, the biggest decisions I face on a daily basis involve when to release my work to the world.</p>
<p>For example, I&#8217;ve been finishing up the manuscript for my next book, which in many ways feels like the most important thing I&#8217;ve ever written. But I&#8217;m beyond petrified of finishing it. Which is what makes me confident I need to do it.</p>
<p>When you begin to feel that fear of inadequacy, knowing you&#8217;ve done the work and simply sat on your behind, this is a telltale sign that it&#8217;s time to ship. To let go. To turn the work in and move on to the next project.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thankful for this hesitation, the thing that causes me to deliberate over something until it&#8217;s as close to perfect as I can make it. But at the same time, I kind of hate it. It&#8217;s paralyzing.</p>
<p>So without thinking, I close my eyes and hit send on the email or &#8220;publish&#8221; that blog post and let go of my work which will never be totally finished.</p>
<p>Often, I have no idea if it&#8217;s going to move people or flop. But that&#8217;s not my call to make. What&#8217;s mine to do, and perhaps yours as well, is to do the work and accept the outcome. Quality comes with time.</p>
<p>Your job is to trust the process and keep showing up.</p>
<div class="special"><strong>Note:</strong> If you&#8217;ve ever wondered what this looks like practically or what you can do to put your work out in the world, I recommend <a title="How to Launch a Blog" href="http://goinswriter.com/launch-blog/" target="_blank">starting a blog</a>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m launching a new project later this month. It&#8217;s always a scary thing, sharing some brand new creation you&#8217;ve made. What if people don&#8217;t understand what you&#8217;re trying to do? What if they don&#8217;t see the value? What if they <em>hate</em> it?</p>
<p><a href="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/ProductKey_1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15382 size-large" src="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/ProductKey_1-630x350.png" alt="The 4 Keys to Creating Powerful Product Launches" width="630" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>There is, however, a simple way to make sure none of those fears come true.</p>
<p>Every great launch begins with a plan. All worthy endeavors, or at least most of them, are not merely thrown together but carefully considered and then executed.</p>
<p>To make sure I don&#8217;t get this wrong, I&#8217;m reviewing a few epic launches from the world of business, technology, and online entrepreneurship. And I thought I&#8217;d share what I learned with you.</p>
<p>So here goes. There are four keys to launching anything &#8212; a book, a business, even a blog &#8212; well. And below I will share them with you, along with some familiar and not-so-familiar examples.</p>
<h3>Key #1: Anticipation (Why People Stand in Line for iPhones)</h3>
<p>There is a reason why people stand in line for hours to get the new iPhone when they could merely order one or waltz into an Apple store the next week, getting one without any trouble or hassle. They just can&#8217;t wait.</p>
<p>Anticipation creates demand. It&#8217;s what makes people want what you have and gets them talking about it. (<a href="http://ctt.ec/fzbGu" target="_blank">Tweet that</a>)</p>
<p>So how do you do this? You create anticipation by:</p>
<ol>
<li>announcing a launch date, and</li>
<li>telling people exactly what they need to do on that date.</li>
</ol>
<p>Think of a &#8220;save the date&#8221; card for a wedding. It&#8217;s designed to get people interested in the event, make sure they don&#8217;t schedule something else, and to hopefully get them to attend.</p>
<p>When <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/" target="_blank">Michael Hyatt</a> told people to wait to buy his book until the week it came out, he was building anticipation. And that book became an instant best seller.</p>
<div class="special"><strong>Lesson:</strong> When you tell people to wait, it creates an energy that can be leveraged into action.</div>
<h3>Key #2: Generosity (How Giving Has a Way of Giving Back)</h3>
<p>Speaking of Apple, why did they <a title="Launch Giveaway" href="http://blog.videofruit.com/launch-giveaway/" target="_blank">give all their users a free upgrade to more iCloud space</a> a day before doing a major product launch? And why did <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/" target="_blank">Chris Guillebeau</a> give a free copy of his new book to every single attendee of his conference, totaling nearly 3000 people?</p>
<p>Was it just to be nice? Maybe. But generosity has a way of rewarding the giver. Especially when you time it right.</p>
<p>This is what product launch expert <a title="Jeff Walker" href="http://www.productlaunchformula.com/sw/?30006" target="_blank">Jeff Walker</a> calls a &#8220;pre-pre-launch.&#8221; The idea is to do this before you begin building anticipation for a launch. Do something unexpectedly nice before making an ask like &#8220;go buy my product&#8221; or &#8220;go tell people about my new book&#8221; and see the power of reciprocity at work.</p>
<div class="special"><strong>Lesson:</strong> Practicing generosity is a way of filling the trust tank and building rapport with your audience before asking them to do something. But in order for this strategy work, it must be done in a completely generous way, and you can&#8217;t expect anything in return.</div>
<h3>Key #3: Urgency (Taylor Swift&#8217;s Secret to Selling a Million Records)</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s not enough to have something great to sell or share with the world. It&#8217;s not enough to be generous and kind and hope people will actually give you their time or money. You have to make it urgent.</p>
<p>Most people are procrastinators. I know I am. I will wait until the last possible moment to do something that I know I should do. Why? Because if I don&#8217;t have to do it now, I would rather be doing something else. But when things start to get urgent and I know the clock is ticking, I start to get serious.</p>
<p>I am not alone in this. Many people are this way. Why else are the malls overcrowded on Christmas Eve, trying to cram in those last few hours of gift buying before it really is too late?</p>
<p>In order to get people to say yes to whatever you&#8217;re offering, you can&#8217;t just tell them a date to buy. You have to tell them why now is the best time. As some have said, something bad must happen on the day after your launch. Maybe you take the product off the market or take away a bunch of bonuses.</p>
<p>This is why why after launching my online course seven different times, I still see most of the students sign up on the last day. It&#8217;s also the secret behind Groupon&#8217;s success.</p>
<p>A more recent example is <a title="Taylor Swift" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2014/11/05/361577726/taylor-swift-platinum-party-of-one" target="_blank">Taylor Swift’s latest album launch</a>, which included a time-sensitive contest that required you to buy the CD to enter to win. The timing of the contest just so happened to be the week that the record released. A million records later (all of which sold in a week), Taylor&#8217;s strategy apparently worked.</p>
<div class="special"><strong>Lesson:</strong> People are procrastinators. And you can help them not miss what you have by making your offering impossible to ignore.</div>
<h3>Key #4: Scarcity (Why People Want What They Can&#8217;t Have)</h3>
<p>People don&#8217;t want things that are abundant. We humans have a tendency to ignore the things that are right in front of us, even when they offer incredible value.</p>
<p>But gold? Diamonds? Buffalo nickels? These rare finds always grab our attention.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard, the next big thing online is a new, ad-free social network called <a href="https://ello.co/" target="_blank">Ello</a>. It started out as a way for some friends to stay connected with each other but when it began attracting groups that felt disenfranchised from places like Facebook, suddenly everyone wanted in.</p>
<p>When you sign up for Ello, you get five free invites to share with your friends. And much like with the release of a new Google product, you will find people (like me) begging their acquaintances for an invite.</p>
<p>Apparently, Ello gets over 40,000 invite requests a day. In other words, scarcity works. But for this to work for you, the scarcity you create needs to be legitimate. It can&#8217;t be contrived. For example, when a developer limits the amount of licenses to a new piece of software they can sell, it&#8217;s usually because they want to be able to support their customer base. I also think that&#8217;s the right thing to do.</p>
<div class="special"><strong>Lesson:</strong> Genuine scarcity leads to trust and demand, whereas false scarcity leads to skepticism and doubt. (<a href="http://ctt.ec/CAHd4" target="_blank">Tweet that</a>)</div>
<h3>Putting it all together</h3>
<p>So what does this all mean for you?</p>
<p>It means you need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create something that people are <strong>anticipating.</strong></li>
<li>Be as <strong>generous</strong> as you possibly can be before and while launching it.</li>
<li>Make your offer <strong>urgent</strong> so that people have a reason to buy now.</li>
<li>Make it <strong>scarce</strong> in a way that increases its value.</li>
</ol>
<p>If done right, this can make people want what you have even more. Any fool can put something together and tell people to buy it, but it takes a plan to do a launch right.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<div class="special">If you want to learn more about this, I highly recommend this <a title="Free video series" href="http://www.productlaunchformula.com/sw/?30006" target="_blank">free video series from Jeff Walker </a>on how to do online product launches. I&#8217;m a proud student and affiliate of Jeff and highly recommend his course (which you&#8217;ll hear more about but are in no way obligated to buy), and I can honestly say this is the best stuff I&#8217;ve ever seen on this subject.</p>
<p>If you decide to get his course, I will receive a commission, but remember I don&#8217;t recommend anything I don&#8217;t use myself and absolutely love.</p>
