				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>Scribd, a company offering unlimited access to half a million e-books for $8.99 a month, is announcing that it has raised $22 million in additional funding.</p>
<p>The round was led by Khosla Ventures, with Khosla partner Keith Rabois (previously an executive at PayPal, LinkedIn, Slide, and Square) joining the Scribd’s board as an observer. Asked via email about how the subscription business will play out for books, Rabois noted that the model has “already transformed the way we consume other forms of content.”</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>“With over 80 million users in nearly every country, the Scribd team is well positioned to grow to a massive global audience,” he said.</p>
<p>Launched in 2007 and incubated at Y Combinator, Scribd started out as a document-sharing service. While it still supports those features (and we still use it at TechCrunch when we want to embed documents in our posts), its focus shifted last year to subscription e-books, where competitors include startup Oyster and Amazon’s Kindle Unlimited service.</p>
<p>Echoing Rabois’ comment, co-founder and CEO Trip Adler told me that Scribd now reaches more than 80 million unique visitors each month. He didn’t specify how many of those visitors are actually paying subscribers, but he did say subscriptions have been growing an average of 31 percent each month since the service was officially unveiled in October 2013.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Asked if he thinks the subscription model has now proven itself in the e-book world, Adler replied, “From <em>my</em> perspective it’s proved out. From the industry perspective, there are still people at both ends of the spectrum.” He noted that Scribd is now working with two of the big five publishers (HarperCollins and Simon &amp; Schuster — they’re mostly offering older “backlist” titles).</p>
<p>“I can’t say where we are with the other ones, but they’re all going really well,” he added. “By the end of [2015], we’ll be able to basically say almost all of the significant players in the industry are on-board.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Link to the rest at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/02/scribd-khosla-funding/"  target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TechCrunch</a></p>
<p>PG says this is a rare occurrence &#8211; a prominent VC firm making an investment in a company that competes with Amazon. The investment is not very large, but it will keep an ebook subscription business operating and competing with Amazon for at least a few more years.</p>
<p>And, yes, PG has his doubts that standard Big Publishing contracts made adequate provisions to allow publishers to enter into this business in the way they seem to be proceeding.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From The Book Deal:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kimberley Cameron is a great example of how one innovative agent is dealing with the stonewalling risk-averse attitude these days of many mainstream commercial book publishers.</p>
<p>“Traditional publishers are rejecting so many quality books we’re submitting, by both debut authors and those with a solid track record of successful titles,” Kimberly told me recently. “We’re convinced these books have a market, so we started a new in-house imprint called Reputation books, with the tag <em>Books we stand behind.</em></p>
<p>We’re publishing new titles and rights-reverted backlist books, and releasing them as eBooks, print-on-demand paperbacks, and even hardcover.”</p>
<p>Kimberly Cameron has been a player in the book world for more than twenty years. Writer’s Digest calls her a superstar agent.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p><em><strong>What percentage of writers who get in touch with you do you take on? And how many are debut authors?</strong></em></p>
<p>We get thousands of submissions every year, mostly through email query letters, some through attending writers conferences, and take on less than one percent. About 80 percent of them are debut. I personally have about 50 to 100 authors at various stages of development, submission, publication and marketing. I wish I could clone myself and represent more.</p>
<p><strong><em>What kind of advances are you getting these days?</em></strong></p>
<p>Advances have gotten lower as the industry has changed, so sometimes I’m content with a few thousand for an unproven author. But I made a two-book $85,000 deal recently for a debut author. It was so satisfying to make that call to let her know. We’ve also made deals for more than $100,000 but not for first-time authors.</p>
<p><strong><em>Why did you start Reputation Books?</em></strong></p>
<p>We continue to sell books to the various big conglomerate imprints. For example, I recently sold a new author’s first thriller to Minotaur at St. Martin’s for a solid advance. But we also spend countless hours sending out manuscripts we love and believe in without finding a home for them. It can get frustrating to wait and wait and then be rejected. It’s not only a question of time, though, but an instinct, a feeling that we’ve exhausted all the old possibilities. So I believe that agents have to adapt to myriad transformations in publishing. Our role is constantly changing. It makes sense to step in and rescue those books that might never be published, and I like being a publisher.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From author and TPVregular Camille LaGuire:</p>
<blockquote><p>I just spent three hours writing a blog post &#8212; trying to capture what I see in the state of publishing right now &#8212; which I then decided to pitch, because my perception had changed in the space of writing it.  This is the fourth or fifth post I&#8217;ve written on this subject in the past week.  Things seem to be changing really fast again in the industry.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p><b>Last Year the Indies Got Less Indie (but now they&#8217;re free again)</b></p>
<p>One of the things that changed is that for the past 6-18 months, the indie publishing world had become almost synchronized.</p>
<p>And now suddenly it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a bad thing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it has, as a side effect, done some bad things.  In particular, the crash of a number of successful careers.</p>
<p>There are some in traditional publishing (who should know better, as they have the longer term experience to know that success tends to rise and fall on a 5-7 year cycle &#8212; which is about how long many of these indies have been around) who are crowing about it.  They are declaring the end of indie publishing &#8212; or at least the end of that snotty, successful side of indie publishing.</p>
<p>And many indies agree with them.  They fear that now traditional publishers will retake the market, and that indie publishing will be pushed back to the margins.</p>
<p>Which is a mistake on both their parts.</p>
<p>Oh, sure, I expect traditional publishing will see some recovery from the nervous days of this past year or so.  They have got used to the new world, and have had time to adjust their own strategies.  And yes, the gold rush is over, and some people will quit self-publishing, but most who decide to ride out the negative wave will build an even stronger career.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>The internet did not just remove gatekeepers, it removed gates. It removed walls. It removed all kinds of barriers.  Including the barrier between amateur and pro, reader and writer.</p>
<p>And Amazon seems like the only one in publishing to realize that.  The KDP is just a more extreme from of self-service, where the customers supply the content to each other.</p>
<p>Which is what the internet is.  It&#8217;s what the new paradigm is all about. Open source.  Creative commons.  Information wants to be free, and all that.  (Also, Information wants to have a small fee taken by the enabler of its freedom.)</p>
<p>This world is no longer about pushing a product from producer to consumer.  It&#8217;s about connections.  It&#8217;s about engagement.</p>
<p><b>And three or four years ago the whole indie community knew this.</b></p>
<p>We knew that this was a great new world, empty of boundaries, and full of popcorn kittens. (&#8220;Popcorn kittens&#8221; is a concept spawned by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDABjGGeZzM"  target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this video</a> &#8212; which is a metaphor for the fact that we had so many opportunities, our minds were like these kittens, bouncing and tumbling with ideas.  Heck, WE were like those kittens. Bouncing, slipping, tumbling and trying out new things all the time.)</p>
<p>At that time, while few of us were getting rich, most of us were actually making money.  Not a lot, but we all could see it.  <b>We all made more money than we had made in traditional publishing:</b> If you had made no money at all, you now made pocket change.  If you had made pocket change, you now made folding money, etc.</p>
<p>And that was great.</p>
<p>But then something changed.</p>
<p>There was so much opportunity, that people started chasing success.  Speculative fever chased away the popcorn kittens.  And thus began what some people call a &#8220;gold rush.&#8221;  (It was never a &#8220;bubble&#8221; btw, because it was never a scheme driven by false or inflated value.  The value was always real.)</p>
<p>And since excitement always draws in those looking for a short cut or a quick buck, some of the gold rush was accelerated by an influx of the get-rich-quick crowd. But it also happened naturally, because entrepreneurship is HARD, and the glitter of success, just out of reach, can be very distracting.  In any case, success begat glitter, and glitter begat more chasing of success, and the kittens ran for cover.</p>
<p>We stopped being creative, and started following formulas.  We started playing the odds, and applied the Pareto Principle, not realizing that, even though all of your success comes from 20 percent of your effort, you actually need to go through that other 80 percent of effort before the 20 percent can pay off.</p>
<p>We narrowed our focus.  And narrowed it more.</p>
<p>And suddenly too many people were doing exactly the same thing at the same time.  Which is exactly what causes the end of every gold rush.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From BookRiot:</p>
<blockquote><p>A few years ago, I wrote a silly post about literary confessions — one of which was that I frequently confused <em>Jane Eyre</em> and Jane Austen. It was mostly a joke, but also when I told people that in real life, they’d always look at me with that particular sympathy consistent only with a self-deprecating joke falling flat on its face (i.e., too stupid to be funny).</p>
<p>For penance, I decided I should probably read them both — so I knocked out <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> last year, and then just a few weeks ago, <em>Jane Eyre</em>.</p>

Jane Throws Shade</strong> — On page 33, not even 7 percent of the way into the novel, Jane tells her adopted guardian Mrs. Reed she hates her more than anyone else in the world except her idiot son. “I am not deceitful,” she says. “If I were, I should say I loved you.” This was the first indication that many of my long-held preconceptions (read as: misconceptions) about this story were pretty wrong. I thought, maybe this isn’t just a long-winded, ooey-gooey love story. And plus, that made me laugh, and I decided right then I was going to like this book.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p><strong>2. Speaking of Mr. St. John…</strong> — What a tool! I loved laughing at this chucklehead. And it’s too bad he’s so clueless, because his sisters seem nice. And that poor rich lady who is (improbably) in love with him seems nice, too. Good on you, Jane — even if took a touch of the supernatural to somehow hear Mr. Rochester calling to you in your head, and withstand St. John’s “unimpeachable” logic, wily advances, and a free trip to mid-19th century India!</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Futurebook:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tis the season to make predictions, and so we asked digital luminaries from both sides of the pond for their 50 words about digital publishing in 2015.<br />
Here, by way of introduction is my own prediction and analysis about what may pass next year:</p>
<p>In 2014 the digital book business enjoyed a somewhat puzzling year. We now know that the ebook market has settled (for now), and we know now that many of the digital experiments conducted in the years before failed to find a commercial model. What we are left with is a fickle ebook market allied to a print book market only slowly recovering.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>The book business emerges strong and well-formed from the first dazzling shift in digital, but now needs to get more serious about how it operates in this new world. I suspect that some of the moves we’ve seen in 2014, particularly around brands, subscription, and website development, will emerge more fully formed in 2015. As Dave Morris puts it in his comment about content, “The pieces are all there.”</p>
<p>The same is also true across the business: publishers can now publish in a range of forms and formats, they can do so while operating a number of different business models, and can now meet their audiences in an array of different places: but they need to do this strategically and with purpose. We will therefore see greater differentiation in publishing and content creation, a recognition that there genuinely are different markets for distinct types of book—none of them devaluing of the others.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>I don’t think the book market does boring anymore — in the past decade we have witnessed the collapse of one major book chain, Borders, and the near collapse of others; the loss of one major distributor; the invention of the iPad, and Kindle devices; the reinvention of self-publishing; and the rise and rise of social media platforms that put readers and authors together in one space — it therefore seems unlikely that this seismic change won’t continue.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p id="story-continues-1" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="208" data-total-count="208">BROOKLINE, Mass. — On a recent drizzly afternoon, the short-story writer Edith Pearlman sat reminiscing in the living room of her apartment here with her best friend, Sandy Siler, a retired psychoanalyst.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="327" data-total-count="535">Ms. Pearlman recalled a trip they had taken as young women to the Venice Lido. One day, while her friend was off swimming, Ms. Pearlman visited the casino. She said that the man who ran the roulette wheel was very kind and every so often would say something to her, loud enough so only she could hear it and know where to bet.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="88" data-total-count="623">“It was an inside job,” Ms. Pearlman said, grinning broadly. “I did very well.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="58" data-total-count="681">Dr. Siler chimed in, “Edie paid for her entire trip.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="147" data-total-count="828">It was the sort of story — a pretty young tourist, a lovesick croupier, the ineffable mechanisms of chance — in which Ms. Pearlman specializes.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="147" data-total-count="828">On Tuesday, Little, Brown will release “Honeydew,” her fifth story collection and first to be published by a major house. Ms. Pearlman is enjoying a commercial breakthrough at 78, after five decades of writing short stories, some 200 of them, nearly all appearing in small literary magazines.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="147" data-total-count="828">. . . .</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="279" data-total-count="2237">“Edith has always known that death is the essential human story,” the novelist Ann Patchett said. “It’s not about falling in love. It’s not about travel and expectation. The difference between her and the rest of us is that she has always had this electricity, this capacity to draw beauty from loss.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="279" data-total-count="2237">Ms. Pearlman emerged from obscurity in 2011 when her previous collection,“Binocular Vision,” became the first book ever to be a finalist for the National Book Award, the Story Prize, The Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award, which it won.</p>
<p id="story-continues-3" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="580" data-total-count="2817">“With Edith, so often I can’t remember if her stories are something I read or something that somebody told me,” said Ms. Patchett, who wrote the introduction to “Binocular Vision” after selecting one of Ms. Pearlman’s pieces for the “Best American Short Stories” anthology. “Often I’ll be driving and I’ll think: ‘Now, who was that woman who gave pedicures? The one who was spied on by that lonely man from his third-floor bathroom?’ Her stories are so true in how things are lived and how we tell them to one another that they become true in my mind.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="580" data-total-count="2817">. . . .</p>
<p id="story-continues-6" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="219" data-total-count="4428">“I wrote in the cellar for a number of years,” Ms. Pearlman said. “I needed a private space, and it had a furnace, so it was always warm.” Her armchair was forever flanked by the books she used for her research.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="387" data-total-count="4815">Ms. Pearlman published her first story in 1969. Her first book didn’t appear until 1996, a 27-year lag that has been a source of consternation among her fans. But she herself has long promoted writing as an amateur enterprise. All her work, she explained, is directed toward “a single imaginary ideal reader, someone wishing to be entertained and not averse to being enlightened.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Brave New World:</p>
<blockquote><p>What happens when the amount of books available to read exceeds the market’s ability to read them! We have always struggled with more books than buyers. The economics of market forces has always prevailed, choking back on production, shrinking shelf space and reducing the rewards to those who aspire to make fame and fortune from their writing.</p>
<p>It was simple when we only had the physical book. The market was controlled by the shelf space available, the cost of the inventory and the rate of purchases. We still produced more titles and units than could be purchased, but for those who back the right works the rewards were significant and for those with excess inventory there was always the ability to trade this through. Importantly the sales were steady and although unpredictable at title level, they were more predictable at market level. The supply chain was inefficient, but worked and publishers wallpapered stores with their sale or return approach to merchandising. Some aspects still remain, but those heydays are long gone. Many blame the demise of the Net Book Agreement in the UK and the resultant discount wars. The truth is far more complex and one element alone drove the result.</p>
<p>The arrival of the Internet resulted in the virtual shelf and inventory. No longer was shelf space an issue, as warehouse space, distance shopping and customer service prevailed. The back list vied on equal terms with front list and the mid list often found itself squeezed. Those mail order players who were in the market should have won this battle, but were wedded to yesterday, did not understand the new parameters and importantly did not understand virtual inventory and changing consumer demands.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>However, the biggest change that digital introduced was to lower the barriers to publishing, not only allowing anybody to publish anything, but also giving them channels and virtual shells on which to display their works next to more traditional published works. Suddenly we were awash with books, physical and digital. Self publishing was no longer to be dismissed and looked down on. We were no longer just over producing new books, but effectively bringing back every book ever published, but the consumers were still only buying the same number of books. They may buy more to fill their physical shelves, but why should they buy more to fill a virtual shelf?</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From The Atlantic:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smallcaps">Pronounce the word <em>artist</em>,</span> to conjure up the image of a solitary genius. A sacred aura still attaches to the word, a sense of one in contact with the numinous. “He’s an <i>artist</i>,” we’ll say in tones of reverence about an actor or musician or director. “A true artist,” we’ll solemnly proclaim our favorite singer or photographer, meaning someone who appears to dwell upon a higher plane. Vision, inspiration, mysterious gifts as from above: such are some of the associations that continue to adorn the word.</p>
<p>Yet the notion of the artist as a solitary genius—so potent a cultural force, so determinative, still, of the way we think of creativity in general—is decades out of date. So out of date, in fact, that the model that replaced it is itself already out of date. A new paradigm is emerging, and has been since about the turn of the millennium, one that’s in the process of reshaping what artists are: how they work, train, trade, collaborate, think of themselves and are thought of—even what art is—just as the solitary-genius model did two centuries ago. The new paradigm may finally destroy the very notion of “art” as such—that sacred spiritual substance—which the older one created.</p>
<p>Before we thought of artists as geniuses, we thought of them as artisans. The words, by no coincidence, are virtually the same. <i>Art</i> itself derives from a root that means to “join” or “fit together”—that is, to make or craft, a sense that survives in phrases like <i>the art of cooking</i> and words like <i>artful</i>, in the sense of “crafty.” We may think of Bach as a genius, but he thought of himself as an artisan, a maker. Shakespeare wasn’t an artist, he was a <i>poet</i>, a denotation that is rooted in another word for <i>make</i>. He was also a <i>playwright</i>, a term worth pausing over. A playwright isn’t someone who writes plays; he is someone who fashions them, like a wheelwright or shipwright.</p>
<p>A whole constellation of ideas and practices accompanied this conception. Artists served apprenticeships, like other craftsmen, to learn the customary methods (hence the attributions one sees in museums: “workshop of Bellini” or “studio of Rembrandt”). Creativity was prized, but credibility and value derived, above all, from tradition. In a world still governed by a fairly rigid social structure, artists were grouped with the other artisans, somewhere in the middle or lower middle, below the merchants, let alone the aristocracy. Individual practitioners could come to be esteemed—think of the Dutch masters—but they were, precisely, <i>masters</i>, as in master craftsmen. The distinction between art and craft, in short, was weak at best. Indeed, the very concept of art as it was later understood—of Art—did not exist.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>A<span class="smallcaps">rtisan, genius, professional: </span>underlying all these models is the market. In blunter terms, they’re all about the way that you get paid. If the artisanal paradigm predates the emergence of modern capitalism—the age of the artisan was the age of the patron, with the artist as, essentially, a sort of feudal dependent—the paradigms of genius and professional were stages in the effort to adjust to it.</p>
<p>In the former case, the object was to avoid the market and its sullying entanglements, or at least to appear to do so. Spirit stands opposed to flesh, to filthy lucre. Selling was selling out. Artists, like their churchly forebears, were meant to be unworldly. Some, like Picasso and Rilke, had patrons, but under very different terms than did the artisans, since the privilege was weighted in the artist’s favor now, leaving many fewer strings attached. Some, like Proust and Elizabeth Bishop, had money to begin with. And some, like Joyce and van Gogh, did the most prestigious thing and starved—which also often meant sponging, extracting gifts or “loans” from family or friends that amounted to a kind of sacerdotal tax, equivalent to the tithes exacted by priests or alms relied upon by monks.</p></blockquote>
