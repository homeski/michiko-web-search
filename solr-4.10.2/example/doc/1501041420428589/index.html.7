<p>When I started out as a freelance writer, I knew nothing about finding clients that pay well.</p>
<p>I started with bidding sites and general job boards, because I thought it was easy money. But I quickly discovered you can’t <a title="What it Really Takes to Make a Living Writing" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/what-it-takes-make-a-living-writing/" target="_blank">build a successful career</a> as an article writer if you’re only earning $5 per article.</p>
<p>It was clear I needed to make more money for each article.</p>
<p>So I stopped hanging out on the bidding sites and targeted higher-paying writing jobs. In one year's time, I went from earning $5 dollars an article on bidding sites to earning $900 for a feature article.</p>
<p>How? Here are the steps I took:</p>

<p>I started with bidding sites and general job boards, because I thought it was easy money. But I quickly discovered you can’t <a title="What it Really Takes to Make a Living Writing" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/what-it-takes-make-a-living-writing/" target="_blank">build a successful career</a> as an article writer if you’re only earning $5 per article.</p>
<p>It was clear I needed to make more money for each article.</p>
<p>So I stopped hanging out on the bidding sites and targeted higher-paying writing jobs. In one year&#8217;s time, I went from earning $5 dollars an article on bidding sites to earning $900 for a feature article.</p>
<p>How? Here are the steps I took:<br />
<span id="more-4162"></span></p>
<h2>Leverage experience</h2>
<p>After starting at the bottom of the barrel in pay, I had nowhere to go but up, right?</p>
<p>And I did. I used testimonials and clips from bidding sites (published and ghost-written clips with the appropriate permissions) to apply to potential clients on job boards. This change in my marketing approach quadrupled my average pay per article from $5 to $20.</p>
<h2>Differentiate</h2>
<p>Although I had a tiny victory in raising my per-article rate to $20, I knew I had to keep learning to command professional rates. I looked for a way to set myself apart myself from the competition.</p>
<p>My first approach was to <a title="AP Style" href="https://www.apstylebook.com/" target="_blank">learn Associated Press Style,</a> the leading compendium of writing conventions that newspapers and magazines follow. Taking the initiative to learn AP Style using the latest guide, online resources, and my clients&#8217; unique style guides showed I was eager to learn and a quick self-study.</p>
<p>I used that knowledge — and my testimonials — to reach out to editors at trade publications and online magazines. This shift put me into the $.10-a-word range, <a title="How One Freelance Writer Got a 600 Percent Raise" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/freelance-writer-got-600-percent-raise/" target="_blank">ramping my income up</a> to about $50 per article.</p>
<h2>Learn and improve</h2>
<p>One trick I used to find my writing weak spots was to run my articles through Copyscape, comparing the draft I turned in with the final version. Comparing lede to lede, nut graf to nut graf, and so on, Copyscape highlights what clients kept &#8212; and what I needed to improve upon.</p>
<p>I also asked editors for feedback on what I did right and, more important, what I did wrong. This was helpful because the editor pointed out things I missed. I learned more about the publications&#8217;s voice, better ways to introduce quotes, article depth, and details on the intended audience.</p>
<h2>Build a portfolio</h2>
<p>Creating a portfolio gave me more confidence to quit bidding sites completely and rely only on reputable job boards that pay professional rates.</p>
<p>After a year of perseverance and prospecting to clients, I made a pitch to a nonprofit organization, and got an assignment for a $900 feature article!</p>
<p>This win came from my pitch to Best Friends Animal Society. The story focuses on how therapy dogs saved U. S. soldiers from physical/emotional disabilities (PTSD), and how the soldiers saved the dogs from being euthanized. A topic close to my heart — and a great fit for my chosen nonprofit.</p>

<p>Well, here's something interesting that just happened to me that explains why I keep encouraging writers to learn reporting: I did a Google search on a term, and got some results...and then a section of results labeled "In-depth Articles."</p>
</p>
<p>Article writing is the future. More businesses will be paying for it, online magazines are springing up -- the lucrative opportunities for writers who can develop a great idea, do a sharp interview, and weave it into a compelling story are growing like mad.</p>
</p>
<p>We've also got article writing on the brain around here because of an upcoming writing class I'll be teaching with Linda Formichelli -- we're giving out some <a title="How to find experts for your article" href="http://articlemasterclass.com/landing/free-article-writing-resources/#2" target="_blank">free article-writing trainings</a> to celebrate that right now, if you haven't seen.</p>

<p>When I first got into writing, I imagined I'd be living alone in some tiny apartment above a little boutique in some rundown alley, scribbling and starving.</p>
<p>My life didn't work out remotely like that. Instead, I'm a mom of three and married 30+ years! (Yes, thanks, I was a child bride.) And instead of writing alone in a garret somewhere, I wrote for editors at a string of publications, and later for businesses.</p>
<p>My point is, every successful writer I know has many people standing behind them -- family members, personal friends, writer friends, editors, mentors, and more. If you're a blogger, most of need tech helpers, too.</p>
<p>As we wind to the end of the year, I want to take a moment to recognize all the people who stand behind me, and who've helped me be a successful freelance writer and online entrepreneur.</p>

<p><span id="more-4129"></span></p>
<h2>The home team</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ll kick it off by mentioning that my husband has been an enthusiastic supporter of every single idea I&#8217;ve ever had for my writing business &#8212; even the ones that involved a decent amount of risk and the outlay of thousands of dollars. I know not every spouse is like that, and feel very fortunate. Thanks, honey.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also a super brainstormer &#8212; <a title="Larry Tice" href="http://seattledigitalvideo.com/" target="_blank">Larry</a> helped develop the name for <a title="Freelance Writers Den" href="http://freelancewritersden.com/" target="_blank">Freelance Writers Den,</a> for just one example.</p>
<p>All three of my kids have helped out here on the blog at some point, too, killing spam and doing other menial tasks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been lucky to have terrific mentors both as a blogger and a writer &#8212; <a title="Boost Blog Traffic" href="http://boostblogtraffic.com/" target="_blank">Jon Morrow</a>, <a title="Mary Jaksch" href="http://writetodone/about" target="_blank"> Mary Jaksch</a>, <a title="Danny Iny" href="http://www.firepolemarketing.com/danny-iny/" target="_blank">Danny Iny</a>, <a title="Ed Gandia" href="http://b2blauncher.com/" target="_blank">Ed Gandia</a>, and my departing <em>Forbes</em> editor <a title="Tom Post - Forbes" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/tompost/" target="_blank">Tom Post</a> among them. I&#8217;m still learning so much from each of you.</p>
<h2>My pro team</h2>
<p>If I rattled off everyone who helps behind the scenes in my business today, this would be a very long post. Let&#8217;s just say I sent out more than ten holiday gifts to my team this year.</p>
<p>Without this group below, I wouldn&#8217;t really be able to freelance myself anymore. Instead, I&#8217;d spend all my time trying to figure out how to make some widget work, probably while crying a lot.</p>
<p>Just a few of the essential people who truly are the secret behind my success:</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignright  wp-image-3259" src="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/Linda-LawnColor-150x150.jpg" alt="Linda-LawnColor" width="66" height="66" />Linda Formichelli</strong> &#8212; One of the best things that ever happened to me was winning Top 10 Blogs for Writers the first time, at the end of 2010 &#8212; mainly because that&#8217;s how I met Linda. She&#8217;s been a busy Other Den Mother the past couple years, and we also teach <a title="Useful writing courses" href="http://usefulwritingcourses.com" target="_blank">Useful Writing Courses</a> together, including the upcoming <a title="Article Writing Masterclass" href="http://articlemasterclass.com/" target="_blank">Article Writing Masterclass</a>. Linda is whip-smart, super-funny, and you should read her <a title="The renegade writer" href="http://www.therenegadewriter.com/" target="_blank">Renegade Writer</a> blog, if you&#8217;re not already.</p>
<p><strong> <img class="alignright  wp-image-4181" src="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/Keira-LinkedIn-150x150.png" alt="Keira-LinkedIn" width="59" height="59" />Keira Dooley</strong> &#8212; Keira created everything you&#8217;re looking at on this blog and on the Den site, on my <a title="Twitter - Carol Tice" href="https://twitter.com/ticewrites" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. Especially, all the pro-looking <a title="Article Writing Masterclass" href="http://articlemasterclass.com/" target="_blank">sales pages</a>, site logos, Facebook ads, and <a title="Ebooks for writers" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/ebooks" target="_blank">e-book covers</a>. To sum up, she makes me look like I know what I&#8217;m doing. She&#8217;s like a magical design fairy who waves her mouse and suddenly, I&#8217;ve got a sparkly gown and I&#8217;m ready to go to the ball.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft wp-image-4178 size-full" src="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-12-23-at-3.54.58-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-23 at 3.54.58 PM" width="62" height="58" />Gerard Greenidge</strong> &#8212; When I need some fancy plug-in or program to talk to PayPal, WordPress, or about six other things, Gerard is the man for this job. Massaging databases, helping <a title="Den affiliates" href="http://freelancewritersden.com/affiliates" target="_blank">Den affiliate sellers</a>, fixing broken stuff, creating pay buttons for classes, discounts, and special offers, reworking, upgrading, sanding, buffing, helping me deliver free goodies I want to hand out&#8230;it&#8217;s Gerard doing all the heavy lifting.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignright  wp-image-4176" src="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-12-23-at-3.54.20-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-23 at 3.54.20 PM" width="66" height="58" />Jennifer Roland</strong> &#8212; It was a good day when Jenn replied to my ad for a Den admin a couple years back.

<p>I groaned when I read the email subject line, saying a former client had written a bad review of my business on a very popular online site.</p>
<p>This<a title="The Right Way to Drop a Writing Client: My 5 Tips" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/time-kill-writing-client/" target="_blank"> client had been a problem</a> for several weeks, and finally requested a refund. Despite my no-refunds policy, I agreed.</p>
<p>Because of a postal delay, that refund check didn’t arrive by the designated deadline. The client then sent an obnoxious email and posted negative reviews to Yelp and Thumbtack.com — sites where my profiles generate a combined 85 percent of my new client calls. Negative reviews on these important prospecting tools could tank my business.</p>
<p>Plus, the Better Business Bureau contacted me for a written response to his complaint there.</p>
<p>No question -- it was a client disaster in the making.</p>
<p>I know clients need to trust professional resume writers like myself, so this was a "do or die" situation.</p>
<p>How can you make a bad review work for you, and not against you? Here's what I did:</p>

<p>No question &#8212; it was a client disaster in the making.</p>
<p>I know clients need to trust professional resume writers like myself, so this was a &#8220;do or die&#8221; situation.</p>
<p>How can you make a bad review work for you, and not against you? Here&#8217;s what I did:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-4136"></span></p>
<h2>Calm Your Emotions</h2>
<p>My first reaction was frustration and slight panic.</p>
<p>Then I remembered what a former boss once told me: &#8220;How you react to a negative situation reflects on how you handle your business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another mentor told me to stick to the facts and not add any emotional responses to resolve complaints.</p>
<p>I analyzed the bad review to determine how to best respond professionally. Once I focused on the issues and trusted my instincts, the responses flowed smoothly. Plus, by focusing on the facts, you show professionalism and a calm demeanor while respecting the client. That impresses prospects that you won&#8217;t trash them online, either.</p>
<h2>Stick to the Facts</h2>
<p>This client claimed I missed multiple deadlines, including his refund, and attacked my integrity, work ethic, and work hours. And he claimed I was dishonest because I&#8217;d required full payment up front.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how I addressed each issue, showing ownership for what I could control:</p>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. Postal Service perhaps delayed delivery of the refund, which I can&#8217;t control. Once aware, I cut a new check and sent it certified mail. He received it in 48 hours.</li>
<li>To speak to my character, I mentioned a public service I provide the unemployed, and that I rearrange my schedule to meet writing deadlines.</li>
<li>I mentioned that payment up front is the norm for professional resume writers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reach Out to Happy Clients</h2>
<p>Wanting positive reviews to round out my page, I contacted past clients and sent my Thumbtack link. These bolstered my ranking and helped offset the impression given by the single negative review.</p>
<p>Thumbtack&#8217;s support team and the BBB raved at my professional responses, and the positive comments I solicited .</p>
<p>By staying positive, I&#8217;ve been able to find new clients and earn $1,100-$1,500/week, avoiding the typical seasonal famine that afflicts resume writers. And my <a title="How I Got a Great Freelance Gig After a Royal Screw Up" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/great-freelance-gig-after-royal-screw-up/" target="_blank">new clients</a> are excited to work with a professional.</p>

I know mine do.</p>
<p>Now&#8217;s the time to lay the groundwork to earn more in the months ahead.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also a busy time for many of us &#8212; there&#8217;s shopping, travel, vacationing, kids at home, visiting, decorating the house, and more.</p>
<p>Still, there&#8217;s one change you can begin making right now that I promise you will set the stage for a more lucrative freelance New Year. This will take a minute a day, tops.</p>
<p>It involves taking quick action to eliminate the single biggest problem freelance writers face.</p>
<p>Do you know where that massive stumbling block is located? Well, go to a mirror and take a look at your head.</p>
<p><span id="more-4130"></span></p>
<p>In my experience, the top problem freelance writers face is right there, between your ears.</p>
<h2>Here&#8217;s what needs to be different</h2>
<p>The biggest thing that needs to change to grow your writing income is your attitude.</p>
<p>We fill our heads with &#8220;that&#8217;s too hard&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m scared&#8221; thoughts, and then we don&#8217;t get paying gigs.</p>
<p>So this coming week, focus on changing how you view yourself as a freelance writer. Pop out that negative self-talk tape you&#8217;re playing, and write a new one to use for 2015. Yes, I do recommend you physically write it down.</p>
<p>Depending on what you&#8217;re struggling with, your attitude change might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beating yourself up about what you haven&#8217;t accomplished yet? <a title="A short prayer for freelance writers" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/prayer-for-freelance-writers/" target="_blank">Forgive</a>.</li>
<li>Worried you&#8217;re unqualified? Realize there are <a title="The credentials you need to be a freelance writer" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/credentials-freelance-writer/" target="_blank">no formal credentials needed</a>.</li>
<li>Afraid of being rejected? Relax &#8212; it&#8217;s <a title="How writers can stop being crushed by fear of rejection" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/writers-stop-being-crushed-by-fear-of-rejection/" target="_blank">sure to happen</a>, so no need to fear it.</li>
<li>Think you&#8217;re too young, or too old? Some client wants your POV and experience, as long as you <a title="How young writers are killing their chances" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/how-young-writers-kill-their-chances/" target="_blank">present yourself professionally</a>.</li>
<li>No work in your small town? Realize freelance writing is a <a title="Writers in charge - how to get lucrative freelance writing gigs no matter where you live" href="http://www.writersincharge.com/lucrative-freelance-writing-gigs/" target="_blank">global business</a> now.</li>
<li>Hesitant to ask for a raise? <a title="How to earn more money as a freelance writer -- no marketing required" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/easy-way-earn-more-money-as-a-freelance-writer-no-marketing-required/" target="_blank">Be bold</a>.</li>
<li>Hate marketing? Make a pact with yourself to <a title="Marketing my writing: How I learned to love it" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/marketing-writing-learned-love/" target="_blank">find a method you enjoy</a>.</li>
<li>Holding back because you feel a need to improve your writing first? Plan to <a title="Article Writing Masterclass" href="http://articlemasterclass.com/" target="_blank">take a class</a> to gain the confidence you need.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever aspect of your attitude needs adjusting, now&#8217;s the time to start thinking differently. It takes time to change our thought patterns &#8212; and its not easy.</p>
<p>Give yourself a few weeks to build your confidence now. Repeat your new attitude statements daily, and you&#8217;ll roll into 2015 ready to go after better-paying gigs.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s your new, improved attitude for next year?</strong></em> Leave a comment and share it.<br />

<p>You may keep strange hours. You may have to navigate periods of too much work — and the dry spells that sometimes follow.</p>
<p>The one thing you need most is the support of those around you. But sometimes they just don’t get it.</p>
<p>Here are the comments I’ve heard from people who don’t understand freelancing — and the responses I’ve used to help them get it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-4102"></span></p>
<h2>1. “If you had a <em>real</em> job, you’d understand.”</h2>
<p>For people who equate the word “job” with working 9-5, the world of freelance writers is baffling.</p>
<p>You see the late nights, early mornings, and weekend work. They picture you napping during the day and binge-watching Netflix.</p>
<p>Comments like these are hurtful, no doubt. But they’re often said because of a true lack of understanding (or even a little tinge of jealousy), and not out of spite. Knowing this can help to lessen the sting.</p>
<p>Instead of throwing a jab back, try educating the person about what life is really like for freelance writers. When they toss an, “If you had a real job” your way, you can say,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Actually, I’ve got deadlines to meet and clients counting on me just like you do. Every morning I get up at 7:30, answer e-mails from clients, spend some time brainstorming story ideas, put together pitches for magazines, and scout out potential new clients.</p>
<p>&#8220;I break around noon for lunch, probably like you do when you’re at work, then I get back to it and spend time writing and revising copy, meeting with clients in person or on the phone, and sending invoices. It&#8217;s a real job &#8212; I’m just doing it in my home.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>2. “What do you <em>do</em> all day?”</h2>
<p>This may come from a friend who has the day off and wants you to join them somewhere. Or it could be an honest question from a family member who just isn’t thinking about the implications of their words.</p>
<p>Instead of laughing off the remark or rolling your eyes, try saying something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I usually start my day by answering e-mails from clients. Then I spend the rest of the morning working on new projects, whether it’s writing an article for a magazine or handling copy for a client’s brochure.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the afternoon, I’ll work on pitching new clients or invoicing so I can keep the work coming in when I’ve wrapped up my current projects. Sometimes, I’ll have a meeting with a potential new client or a call with an existing one. I typically work until 5:30 or so, and may do some more work in the evening depending on deadlines.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s easy for someone to understand what a doctor or a teacher does when they head into work, but they may need more details to fully appreciate the <a title="New Data Reveals Why Today’s Freelance Writers Are Smart" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/freelance-writers-smart-stop-feeling-weirdos/" target="_blank">workflow of a freelance writer</a>. By hearing exactly what a day looks like for you, they’ll understand it’s not just about lounging around in your sweats.</p>
<h2>3. “Could you watch kids/do an errand for me?&#8221;</h2>
<p>You know the quality of your work suffers when you divert attention away from writing projects to child care or household chores, but this may not be apparent to others.</p>
<p>Explain to your family that <a title="How I Became a More Productive Writer by Doing This One, Simple Thing" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/productive-writer-one-simple/" target="_blank">your workday is like anyone else’s</a>, even if it happens at home:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It wouldn’t be a good idea if I showed up to your school or workplace with a load of laundry that needs folding, right? These chores wait until you come home, so you can concentrate during the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’d appreciate it if it could be the same for me. My work suffers when I’m trying to multitask, and I want to make sure I keep my clients happy by giving them 100 percent of my attention.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Whatever you do, keep your cool &#8212; and remember, the only one who really has to understand the freelance lifestyle is you. If friends and family don&#8217;t get it, <a title="Freelance Writers Den" href="http://freelancewritersden.com" target="_blank">find a writer community</a> where you can share your concerns.</p>

<p>It can be one of the most enjoyable assignments in journalism -- interview movie stars! Or music artists, politicians, magicians, authors, dancers, mega-church pastors. Pick your favorite celebrity flavor.</p>
<p>But it's often difficult to get famous people to grant you an interview. I spent 12 years pursuing CEOs of major corporations for interviews as a staff reporter, and I was a movie-industry secretary for several years, so I speak from experience on both sides of the fence here.</p>
<p>Here's what I learned: To get household names to slot you an interview time, you have to be wily, creative, and unstoppable.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s often difficult to get famous people to grant you an interview. I spent 12 years pursuing CEOs of major corporations for interviews as a staff reporter, and I was a movie-industry secretary for several years, so I speak from experience on both sides of the fence here.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I learned: To get household names to slot you an interview time, you have to be wily, creative, and unstoppable.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>Here are my tips for landing celebrity interviews:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-4042"></span></p>
<h2>1. Start small</h2>
<p>Major celebrities want to be interviewed by people with a track record of interviewing public figures. So if you&#8217;re interested in this niche, look for ways to get started.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to interview Lady Gaga, start interviewing local singers in your town for the local daily or alternative paper. Into politics? Talk to your small-town mayor, or cover your city council for a local rag. If you swoon over actors, interview the star of your local theater production for a start.</p>
<p>Every town has local celebrities &#8212; the former Olympian or TV star from the &#8217;60s who retired there. Find them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s common these days for big celebrities to do group phone interviews, where hundreds of reporters might be on the line, taking turns asking questions. Don&#8217;t turn these offers down &#8212; go, listen, learn what the big outlets ask, and see if you can get in a question. Sure, it&#8217;s not an exclusive, but it&#8217;s a start at interacting with celebs.</p>
<p>Build up your celebrity-interview track record, so you can show clips that confirm you&#8217;re accurate and know how to get lively quotes from busy people.</p>
<h2>2. Work your connections</h2>
<p>Never assume you know no one who could give you an introduction to a celebrity. The way we&#8217;re all connected online these days, it&#8217;s six degrees of Kevin Bacon out there.</p>
<p>Remember, you may not need a connection directly to the celeb. An introduction to one of their handlers &#8212; manager, agent, publicist &#8212; might work just as well. Start by asking if anyone knows who manages your dreamboat (or Google it and see if you can find out). Getting a warm intro to one of the team could be all you need to get your interview idea a fair hearing.</p>
<h2>3. Appeal to their interests</h2>
<p>Do some research and learn about your celebrity. Do they have a pet charity they love to support? Did they found a charity of their own? Are they a born-again Christian? A Scientologist? A vegan? A motorcycle nut?</p>
<p>Think about publications that might want an interview with your target about that aspect of their life. Celebrities give many interviews, and they like variety. They get tired of being asked the same six questions about their upcoming film, and might love to talk about their new boyfriend, their customized Harley, their backyard organic garden&#8230;anything else.</p>
<p>Develop a focused angle for your interview that&#8217;s off the beaten trail and interest a magazine in it, and you might get a yes. A pitch like &#8220;I want to interview Joe Famous for X magazine&#8221; leaves the celebrity nervous about what you might ask.</p>
<h2>4. Be where they are</h2>
<p>One thing is as certain as the rising of the sun: Celebrities make personal appearances. They turn up at movie premieres and charity events and industry conclaves on a fairly regular basis.</p>
<p>Greta Garbo and J.D. Salinger are dead, and so is the concept of the reclusive celebrity. They all appear sooner or later, and they all want press.</p>
<p>Your job is to learn where they&#8217;ll be, and show up there. Yes, you might need to wangle a ticket to an event, or even buy one. But usually, there&#8217;ll be a media question time at these celebrity sightings, and you could get a chance to pop out a question or two.</p>
<h2>5. Persist</h2>
<p>Top celebrities often have multiple layers of protection around them, and it&#8217;s all designed to get rid of you. A hot actor may have both a manager and an agent, as well as a publicist and a personal assistant. You watched <em>Entourage</em>, right?</p>
<p>All of these people may need to confer and concur that your interview proposal is a good idea. That can take weeks.</p>
<p>Allow plenty of time. Often, you&#8217;ll have to gently follow up, over and over. Never, ever be angry with the team. That will kill your chances dead.</p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t hearing a yes, don&#8217;t just sit on your hands waiting. Keep developing thoughts and ideas and questions&#8230;and send them over. Try a junior member of the PR staff and see if you can pick their brain for tips. Propose different angles. See what might make the penny drop.</p>
<p>With some celebs, this may be a dance that takes years to complete. Just keep working at it and developing relationships with celebrity PR people.</p>
<h2>6. Use social media</h2>
<p>Social media has become the great workaround for reaching celebrities with an impenetrable PR wall. Many celebrities are tweeting their little hearts out. You can stalk venture capitalists on LinkedIn &#8212; I did that more than once for one of my <a title="How They Started" href="http://www.amazon.com/How-They-Started-David-Lester-ebook/dp/B008846LN0/" target="_blank">print business books</a>. I also got one of the biggest interviews in that book by leaving a comment on one very famous company founder&#8217;s blog.</p>
<p>If you think a prominent figure won&#8217;t return your tweet, I&#8217;ll just say that I got <a title="Entrepreneur -- Shark Tank effect" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/slideshow/224405" target="_blank">every investor on the ABC series <em>Shark Tank</em></a> to talk to me for one feature article &#8212; and I connected with most of them on<img class="alignright wp-image-4153 " src="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/Herjevec-answers-my-tweet.png" alt="Herjevec from Shark Tank answers my tweet" width="434" height="227" /> Twitter.</p>
<p>One thing I&#8217;ll note about that tweet on the right: My pitch there also uses tip #3.</p>
<p>What investor doesn&#8217;t want to brag about how smart they are, and how their picks did great? So I didn&#8217;t just tweet them &#8212; I had a question I knew they&#8217;d love to answer.</p>
<h2>7. Dig dirt</h2>
<p>There is one foolproof way to get a celebrity to talk &#8212; find out something scandalous about them that nobody else knows yet.</p>
<p>Comb court records for lawsuits. Interview their former housekeeper. Verify nasty rumors you hear.</p>
<p>This approach won&#8217;t be for everybody, but it&#8217;s the tabloids&#8217; bread-and-butter. Everybody loves an exposé. Even better, if you find your own facts, then you&#8217;ve got a story about a celebrity you can do, even if they <em>refuse</em> to talk. But most often, they&#8217;ll jump at the chance to spin the negative news their way.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s less common, you can also break stories and get celebs on the line by finding out something good that&#8217;s not common knowledge yet, too. That baby on the way, the hot new role they&#8217;ve landed &#8212; that works, too.</p>
<h2>Which comes first</h2>
<p>One of the big questions I get asked about celebrity interviews is who to ask first &#8212; the publication or the celebrity. The answer is the celebrity.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t ever want to tell a magazine you can deliver a celebrity interview, only to have to come back later and say really, you had no contact with that person and they&#8217;re not returning your calls. That can really blow your credibility with that editor.</p>
<p>What you can do is explore with a magazine editor whether they&#8217;d be interested in an interview with Jill Rockstar about X topic. You&#8217;ll almost always get a &#8216;yes&#8217; &#8212; and then you can take that to the celebrity&#8217;s people to show them their star won&#8217;t be wasting their time talking to you.</p>
<p>I once cold-called a celebrity magazine to ask if they were interested in a chat with a film star I knew I would be on-set with soon&#8230;and they about fell over themselves with excitement. They didn&#8217;t even ask to see my clips (which were nonexistent at that point).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got access to a celebrity, it can open a lot of doors. It&#8217;s worth starting small and building up some celeb Q&amp;A clips to show around.</p>

<p>But if you care about earning more as a freelance writer, then you might want to stop writing blog posts.</p>
<p>Why do I say this?</p>
<p>There are four big reasons I want to steer you away from blogging:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-4133"></span></p>
<h2>1. It&#8217;s a time-waster</h2>
<p>One common affliction currently plaguing many aspiring freelance writers is that they start a blog because they&#8217;ve heard they should. Next, they fall in love with the blog, and then spend way too much time on it. All at the expense of finding the paying clients they need, and without examining what they&#8217;re blogging about or why.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the typical diary-you-put-online type blog posts rarely attract many readers. And they don&#8217;t make a good writing sample for luring clients, either. Businesses want fact-filled posts written on a single topic, not random posts about your personal thoughts.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s so empowering, pushing that &#8216;publish&#8217; button on whatever you want to say&#8230;that it becomes addictive.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unusual for writers to tell me:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My goals for this month include posting twice a week on each of my three personal blogs. Plus&#8230;um&#8230;guess I need to do some marketing to find clients.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The blogging sucks up all your free time, the marketing falls to the bottom of your priority list, and next year, you&#8217;re still starving.</p>
<h2>2. It has a crummy reputation</h2>
<p>No client is impressed to hear that you&#8217;re writing blog posts.</p>
<p>Blogging is the entry point. The bottom rung. There&#8217;s no barrier to entry. Often, you have no editor &#8212; and your prospects know it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why blogging isn&#8217;t a prestigious type of writing.</p>
<p>If you can manage to guest post on a big, popular, brand-name blog, that helps your cred a bit. But it&#8217;s still not a byline in <em>Vanity Fair</em> or the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>
<h2>3. It doesn&#8217;t pay well</h2>
<p>Yes, there is an elite rank of business blogging clients that now pay $100-$300 a blog post and more. But even this upper end of blog-post pay is low compared to what you can earn from other types of writing.</p>
<p>And the vast majority of blogging gigs are still going for $5-$25 a post, which isn&#8217;t a living wage in any First World country, no matter how fast you write.</p>
<h2>4. It&#8217;s a shrinking market</h2>
<p>With the ongoing efforts of Google to exclude mass-content sites from its search results, the forecast is for less blogging-for-hire work in future. Most of the cheap, SEO-keyword driven, short-post assignments are drying up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a dying niche because semi-literate, half-baked posts you dash off in 15 minutes for search robots to index don&#8217;t work any more. They don&#8217;t drive traffic because they&#8217;re not turning up in search results. So businesses are not going to pay even $5 for them in future.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re dependent on this sort of work for your living right now, it&#8217;s time to make plans to move into a new niche. You&#8217;ve got all your eggs in a vanishing basket.</p>
<h2>What to write instead</h2>
<p>If I&#8217;ve made you rethink your feelings about blogging, good.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to tell you to stop writing, of course. Just that blogging isn&#8217;t the greatest format if you&#8217;re looking to earn a living from writing (short of seeing a moonshot success on monetizing your own blog).</p>
<p>So what should you write instead of blog posts? Articles.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Articles pay well.</strong> You can earn $1 a word and more, from better companies and publications.</li>
<li><strong>Articles are a prestige assignment.</strong> You&#8217;re not &#8216;just a blogger&#8217; anymore.</li>
<li><strong>Article clips are respected.</strong> Editors and marketing managers alike are impressed when you show them article clips.</li>
<li><strong>People love to read articles.</strong> This is a format that&#8217;s been around a long time, and readers &#8216;get&#8217; it.</li>
<li><strong>Blog posts are becoming articles.</strong> The call for 2,000-word blog posts on many top blogs and websites really means they want articles.</li>
<li><strong>Businesses need articles.</strong> Increasingly, corporate clients are looking for article content for their websites, to set them apart from all those ordinary, low-value blog posts. I&#8217;ve earned $2 a word in this niche.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The secret of online writing success</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you in on a little secret that I think was key to this blog&#8217;s success: I never thought of myself as a blogger.</p>
<p>My concept for this blog has always been that I&#8217;m writing and publishing an online magazine, and these posts are the articles. And that has made all the difference.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why while most blogs blather on about the author&#8217;s personal feelings or whatever strikes their fancy that morning, I do <a title="Writing for Guardian Liberty Voice" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/writing-for-guardian-liberty-voice/" target="_blank">exposés</a>, report on <a title="What the Elance-Odesk merger means for freelancers" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/elance-odesk-merger-freelance-writers/" target="_blank">news that affects freelance writers</a>, and <a title="How will freelance writers earn well from longer blog posts?" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/how-freelance-writers-can-earn-from-long-blog-posts/" target="_blank">discuss trends</a>. Because this is a magazine for freelance writers.</p>
<p>When I started writing article-style posts back in 2008, I think I was a little ahead of the curve. But now, in-depth, fully reported blog posts &#8212; (cough) articles &#8212; are fast becoming the online norm.</p>
<p>If you like writing online, know that article format is the future.</p>
<p>Which makes sense, because readers want great stories and useful information. Fascinating interviews and unique facts. Always have, and always will. In the future, when they&#8217;re laser-beaming content into our brains, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll want.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know how yet, you should learn to deliver this.</p>
<h2>Reposition to earn more</h2>
<p>To sum up: stop writing &#8220;blog posts.&#8221; Stop thinking of yourself as a blogger. Become an article writer instead. If that idea scares you &#8212; of doing interviews and finding facts &#8212; I just want to say: You can do this.</p>
<p>Sell what you&#8217;re writing to clients as articles instead of blog posts. &#8220;Instead of short blog posts, we should create better content that&#8217;s article quality, with interviews and research data &#8212; that&#8217;s what builds authority and really gets you traffic and leads.&#8221; Then, ask for $.50-$1 a word for it.</p>
<p>Ride the trend toward better, article-style content and you&#8217;ll be positioned to earn more as a freelance writer in 2015. Then, you can write whatever you want on your own blog.</p>

You slave away meeting a freelance client&#8217;s deadline, send in your invoice, and then&#8230;nothing.</p>
<p>Your client is smelling like a deadbeat.</p>
<p>What can you do about it? Plenty.</p>
<p>As it happens, I&#8217;ve had my share of clients who drag their heels on payment. Over the years, I&#8217;ve developed a system for making sure those checks arrive&#8230;more on that below.</p>
<p>First, here are my five best tips for rounding up those stray checks:</p>
<p><span id="more-4044"></span></p>
<h2>1. Friendly email reminder</h2>
<p>I like to begin on the assumption that my lack of a payment is a simple oversight or mistake. The day after the payment was due, I send a friendly email:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m just checking in because my final payment on this project was due yesterday. I know you got my final draft a couple weeks ago &#8212; are we all set? Please let me know if you need anything from me, and do let me know when I can expect payment. Let me know if you need another copy of the invoice.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, that&#8217;s all it takes. The invoice was mislaid, or the accountant was out sick a couple days, and your nudge will send the check your way.</p>
<h2>2. Make the call</h2>
<p>No response to this friendly email? It&#8217;s time to try to get them live on the phone.</p>
<p>Many people are less evasive if you can get them on a call. They may give you a sob story about why it&#8217;s late (set phasers to &#8216;ignore&#8217;), but hopefully they&#8217;ll tell you when you can expect the check.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re too chicken to confront a client about an overdue bill, consider hiring a collections agency to help you, or enlist a friend to do it.</p>
<h2>3. Go up the chain</h2>
<p>After a live chat, if the check fails to arrive on the new (late) date they promised, I usually conclude I&#8217;m talking to the wrong person. It&#8217;s time to try someone else.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re talking to an editor, try the managing editor or editor-in-chief. Better yet, try the accounting department. Often, the bean-counters will tell you the editor has failed to send over your invoice for payment. Or they&#8217;ll reveal that the invoice came too late for this month&#8217;s cycle, so it&#8217;ll pay out in 30 days.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been working with a marketing manager at a company, try the chief finance offer (CFO) or their right hand.</p>
<p>Now, you at least know the problem, and can get back to the editor if it&#8217;s their mistake and they need to supply paperwork.</p>
<p>Editors will sometimes dodge these calls because they feel frustrated and helpless &#8212; they don&#8217;t sign the checks, and are often deeply unhappy that their writers are being jerked around. Hopefully, if it&#8217;s an oversight on their part, they&#8217;ll help.</p>
<h2>4. Bill a late fee</h2>
<p>In the absence of any satisfying responses on steps 1-3, I will sometimes re-submit my bill with a 2% monthly late fee (compounding) applied for the first month. For those of you who aren&#8217;t math dorks, that means next month, I&#8217;ll take this new larger amount and charge them 2% more based on that amount, not the original, lower fee. And so on.</p>
<p>Often, the late-fee bill will wake up the client and they&#8217;ll send a check.</p>
<p>They may only send the regular amount and not the late fee, but they decide it&#8217;s time to pay. The late fee makes them see that not only are you not going away, but you will actually expect more money from them, the longer they drag this out.</p>
<p>Once it&#8217;s clear that they can&#8217;t sit on the bill forever without consequence, it&#8217;s amazing how often deadbeats suddenly find the money they need to pay you.</p>
<h2>5. Social shaming</h2>
<p>I know &#8212; I feel ashamed to mention this. It&#8217;s a little bit mean, I admit. But it often works like a charm.</p>
<p>Publicly &#8216;outing&#8217; a deadbeat client in social media can really get them off the dime. Every company is paranoid about social-media reputation damage. So you&#8217;ll usually get a rapid response to a tweet like these:</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8220;@magazine &#8212; Still looking for my $1,000 article fee due 3 weeks ago. When may I expect it?&#8221;</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>&#8220;@company &#8212; Turned in my final draft 3 weeks ago. Payment now overdue. Please advise when I will see my check?&#8221;</p>
<p>OR, possibly worst:</p>
<p>&#8220;@writers &#8212; anyone else writing for @X company? Having trouble getting paid? Would like to connect&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>My social-shaming hint: Keep it professional. Don&#8217;t be rude or call names. Stick to the facts. Once they see that word of their irresponsibility may spread to their own clients, they&#8217;ll probably overnight you a check.</p>
<p>They owe you money, and it&#8217;s overdue. If you start flaming them, you may hurt your chances of getting paid instead of helping them.</p>
<h2>Stop working</h2>
<p>The other thing to do to protect yourself from deadbeat clients is to stop working on any ongoing assignments you have from that client. Slow payers earn a trip to the bottom of your priority list.</p>
<p>You might choose to let them know that this work stoppage has occurred, or you may decide to keep it under your hat. But you should move on immediately to either do other client work or to do marketing to find more clients.</p>
<p>After all, this payment may never arrive. Don&#8217;t get in deeper and rack up more bills with a client who may be getting ready to stiff you. I hear too many sad stories from writers who end up with $10,000 or more outstanding from a client who&#8217;s gone belly-up.</p>
<h2>Preventing the problem</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to prevent the late-payment scenario in the future, there are three key steps to getting prompt payments. You need to have a contract that defines when you get paid, you need to bill clients promptly, and then you must act immediately if payments are late.</p>
<p>One big pitfall many freelance writers fall into is they don&#8217;t have a contract at all. Or if they do, it doesn&#8217;t define how long the client has to pay you after you turn in your work. I prefer terms like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Final payment due on finalization or 14 days after receipt of final draft, whichever is sooner.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Get in the habit of invoicing clients immediately. That&#8217;s right &#8212; don&#8217;t wait around to hear that your draft has been accepted &#8212; send the bill with the first draft, so it gets in their payment cycle right away.</p>
<p>Some companies will take 30-60 days to cut a check and only pay contractors once a month. You don&#8217;t want any delays on your end that might cause you to miss a week they cut checks and leave you waiting another month.</p>
<p>You also need to set up a payment calendar so that you&#8217;re aware of the exact due date for each outstanding payment. The day after it&#8217;s due, if it isn&#8217;t in your hand, you should be using one of the five steps above to let the client know you noticed and care deeply that your payment arrive.</p>
<h2>Why suing is not the answer</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ll note one of my tips is NOT &#8216;take them to court.&#8217; It&#8217;s increasingly rare that pursuing payment via a lawsuit is a sane choice. Freelancing is increasingly a global business, and often, your deadbeat client will be in a different state or even a different country. This makes applying the law extremely difficult, as you might have to appear in court where they&#8217;re located.</p>
<p>But more importantly, suing does two bad things: It costs you money, and it messes with your head.</p>
<p>Unless you have at least $10,000 owed you, even going to small claims court, it&#8217;s not going to be worth it, between your lost work time and lawyer costs.</p>
<p>Worse, thinking about how this client screwed you all the time as you prep and pursue your lawsuit is very bad. This is not a climate that fosters productivity or finding great new clients.</p>
<p>If you try every approach and there&#8217;s still no payment, I offer one final option: Consider this lost money tuition in the school of freelance life.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking: &#8220;He ripped me off for $X thousands!&#8221; realize that this happened because of your own poor freelance business choices&#8230;and learn from it.</p>
<p>You need to qualify clients better in the future and go after more reputable companies and publications, so that you work with clients that pay their contractors &#8212; on time, and well.</p>

<h2>I&#8217;m a freelancer?</h2>
<p>I did my first freelance writing in Seattle’s reality TV industry, when I was 23. During my interview with the production company, I was told the gig was temporary and would only last a few months.</p>
<p>It sounded great, so I accepted it — and the $13-an-hour salary that came with it.</p>
<p>But after talking with my coworkers, I found out I wasn’t a typical employee. In fact, I wasn’t an employee at all. I was a freelancer. And when they said the gig ended in March, they weren’t lying.</p>
<p>Over the next several years, I bounced around in gigs that lasted anywhere from three months to a year — with lapses of up to five months in between.</p>
<p>To survive, I took odd jobs doing everything from coaching soccer to selling cell phones. This hand-to-mouth cycle sucked, but seeing my name in the credits on TV made it seem worth it.</p>
<h2>Not making a living doing what I love</h2>
<p>Of course, reality (no pun intended!) eventually hit.</p>
<p>I was now 29, and had a six-week gig scripting TV. Talking with a fellow co-worker about money, I suddenly realized I made a higher hourly rate delivering pizzas than I did writing nationally broadcast TV.</p>
<p>That realization didn’t sit well with me, and I soon left.</p>
<p>I spent the next ten months in my hometown of Chicago, where my writing hit new lows. The only writing income I made was $25 from Fiverr.</p>
<p>Next, I decided to pack my bags and follow my girlfriend to Bangkok, Thailand. I took a job as an English teacher so I could survive while I figured things out.</p>
<h2>The turning point</h2>
<p>Last December, I read the book <em>Eat That Frog</em> by Brian Tracy. In the opening chapter, the author says the key to being successful at anything is to learn what other successful people are doing &#8212; and do the same.</p>
<p>This seemed obvious at first. But I realized that although I’d spent significant time developing my craft as a writer, I never cared to learn what successful freelancers were doing.</p>
<p>So I started learning. I joined the <a title="Freelance Writers Den" href="http://freelancewritersden.com" target="_blank">Freelance Writers Den</a>. On my hour-long commute to my full-time job, I read blogs and e-books by Ed Gandia, Danny Iny, and others. And I set aside 5 hours a week in the evenings to learn.</p>
<p>One big realization is that I had to stop fearing failure. I&#8217;ve started looking at all my business experiments as practice. If I fail, then it&#8217;s not a big deal. It&#8217;s just practice, and I&#8217;ll get better as I go along if I keep going.</p>
<h2>Taking action</h2>
<p>Another thing I realized? My biggest challenge was marketing. It was scary, and I hated it. But if I was ever going to actually make a living writing, I needed to suck it up.</p>
<p>I started by asking family and friends for referrals. No dice.</p>
<p>I sent letters of introduction to hotels that had poorly translated English websites. But none of them could afford a writer, so that was a dead end.</p>
<p>After about six months, I began<a title="7 Networking Tips for Cowards" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/7-networking-tips-for-cowards/" target="_blank"> going to local networking events</a> hosted by Meetup and the Chambers of Commerce in the embassies here in Bangkok. Once I took the advice of the freelancers I was following and started looking to make friends, not just find work, I started to really enjoy in-person networking.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when I started making progress. I eventually found all three of my current clients through networking.</p>
<h2>Finding clients</h2>
<p>My first client came this past August. I used the lessons I learned — and the templates provided — in the <a title="Freelance Business Bootcamp" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/ebooks" target="_blank">Freelance Business Bootcamp</a> offered within the Freelance Writers Den. It was the first time I ever created a freelance writing contract, negotiated the payment myself, and truly felt in control of my freelance destiny.</p>
<p>Eight years in, and I was finally acting like a real freelancer.</p>
<p>When I got three clients, I quit my full-time job. I have a great variety of work teaching writing to one client, writing video scripts for another, and writing content and web copy for a travel/backpacking site.</p>
<p>And even though some of the rates aren&#8217;t what I&#8217;d ask for now, I feel awesome that I negotiated them myself. My best rate — and my easiest client to work with — came when I entered the negotiation with a solid idea of what other people charged for that type of work and the knowledge that I could walk away if I didn&#8217;t get that rate. I&#8217;m actually prepping to re-negotiate one of my lower-paying clients, and I am ready to quit if they can&#8217;t meet my new rate.</p>
<h2>Having a good problem</h2>
<p>I’m drowning in work now, and I&#8217;ve turned down a few other clients already! I&#8217;m not sending out LOIs, but I am still attending networking events.</p>
<p>This whole &#8220;being swamped with clients&#8221; thing is kind of new to me. And it’s kind of scary.</p>
<p>So what am I doing? Same as before…learning how others handle <a title="How I became a more productive writer by doing this one simple thing" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/productive-writer-one-simple/" target="_blank">juggling multiple clients</a>, and doing the same myself.</p>
