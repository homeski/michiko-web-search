<p>I put out a call on Facebook a few days ago, asking writers who aren&#8217;t writing, why they aren&#8217;t writing. (I know some of my own reasons.) Of course, not writing because you know your creative process and the value of fallow fields is good. I&#8217;m interested in reaching out to those who&#8217;d rather be writing and aren&#8217;t or, for some reason or another, can&#8217;t. Here are some unrefined thoughts on the subject.

<p>I put out a call on Facebook a few days ago, asking writers who aren&#8217;t writing, why they aren&#8217;t writing. (I know some of my own reasons.) Of course, not writing because you know your creative process and the value of fallow fields is good. I&#8217;m interested in reaching out to those who&#8217;d rather be writing and aren&#8217;t or, for some reason or another, can&#8217;t. Here are some unrefined thoughts on the subject. (If I were capable of refined thoughts, I&#8217;d be writing a new novel right now.)</p>
<p>Most of the people wrote in saying that time was the issue. I&#8217;ve given a lot of advice in the past on creating time, on reserving your freshest brain cells for your own work (and committing to that), on reclaiming your muse time (down time while showering, gazing, waiting for kids to get out of practice, commuting) &#8212; I have a very specific speech for this alone.</p>
<p>But the fact is that when juggling the demands of a very, very busy life, sometimes there simply isn&#8217;t enough time. And the novel, in particular, is so architectural burdensome and, early-on, so ungainly that it&#8217;s very hard to work on it in small increments. This is why artist colonies exist and why some writing professors simply don&#8217;t write until summer hits. (I can&#8217;t work this way. I have to write or my gears would whir too hard, and I&#8217;d resent those around me. I believe in living life with a metaphorical metal detector, always listening for the beeps of possible resentment and digging them out so they can&#8217;t root &#8212; especially important in relationships.)</p>
<p>But what happens here is that the desire to write when you know you won&#8217;t really have the time and head space to do it is painful. It&#8217;s an ache. And sometimes the only way to make it not ache is to shut down your desire to write. Stop the wanting. If you practice this, however, this tamping out of the creative impulse, you&#8217;ll perfect it. And once shut off tight, it&#8217;s hard to open again. There&#8217;s been a breach of trust inside of yourself.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure that I have a fix. (Can you accept the ache if you know that a stretch is coming? Can you build stretches for yourself? Can you work with your partner to find ways to allow yourself time and head space?) I do know that shutting down the want is not healthy. It&#8217;s a shutting down on a life force.</p>
<p>In lieu of not having a great answer to the above, I&#8217;ll offer three things I&#8217;ve thought of recently about why I get stuck.<br />
<span id="more-34991"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Being haunted by projects past.</h3>
<p>Sometimes I can&#8217;t move forward because I have too many almost finished projects or fifth-draft disasters or it&#8217;s-so-close-but-this-bucket&#8217;s-got-a-hole novels on my desk. I try to head into something new, but I&#8217;m entangled by the complex pulley system of weighted failures (or near misses).</p>
<p>Should you go backward and rededicate yourself to finishing all of those projects? I&#8217;ll say this. One reason companies fire a CEO is that a new CEO will come in and clean-house on projects that have been draining resources (in our case the resource is time). The old CEOs sometimes can&#8217;t cut a project loose because they feel like they&#8217;ve already invested too much (both resources and personal investment) to let it go. (This is discussed in the book Thinking Fast and Slow, which wasn&#8217;t about writing.) But this is where the phrase about good-money-after-bad comes into play. In some cases, it&#8217;s better to stop pouring time into a novel that&#8217;s not working. It&#8217;s a drain on your resource of time.</p>
<p>That said, can you reframe the loss of, well, perhaps years? You should try. Almost all of my novels have parts of other novels or stories inside of them. In my early days as primarily a short story writer, I used the stories to build novels. Now I use failed parts of novels to build better novels. All of the texture of my failures &#8212; painfully wrought and worry-loved &#8212; are great saplings.</p>
<p>Can you and the almost-novel go &#8220;on a break,&#8221; to reference Rachel and Ross? In this case, you need the time away, but you promise to come back with fresh eyes and you might be able to really make it work. Meanwhile, however, you&#8217;re allowed to work on other things &#8212; it won&#8217;t even be cheating. That&#8217;s key. Write while you&#8217;re on that break because it will allow you, possibly, to get caught up in a novel that could really work.</p>
<p>Fact is, the time away is often what the novel really needs. And this you&#8217;re drilling your skills and learning something (or relearning something) that&#8217;s the answer to the novel that you&#8217;re taking a break from.</li>
<li>
<h3>The Commitment.</h3>
<p>While I&#8217;m locked in edits, my mind riffs on new ideas. They&#8217;re kind of escape hatches. I&#8217;m locked in this book for now, yes, but that escape hatch is marked with some new desired world I want to build, sometimes comedic, sometimes brutal, sometimes just a feeling &#8230; But it keeps me going.</p>
<p>However, if I reside in edit mode for too long, then too many escape hatches appear &#8212; a wall of them. And when I&#8217;m finally allowed to open one, I don&#8217;t just open one. I open five. And then I don&#8217;t know which one to travel through. I&#8217;ve spent too much time, dreamily envisioning each one, and then I&#8217;m over-committed in my imagination, and a kind of paralysis takes hold.<br />
I start writing each one &#8212; just a bit &#8212; to see if one will take the lead.</p>
<p>If I still want, say, three of them, then I need someone else to tell me what to do. It&#8217;s got to be someone I trust &#8212; who knows me and my work and what I want &#8212; even when I&#8217;m not clear on that myself.</li>
<li>
<h3>Commitment within the novel itself.</h3>
<p>Sometimes the problem is that you&#8217;ve written the beginning and now you&#8217;re seeing the infinite heartbeats of the novel &#8212; all the directions it can go. (I&#8217;ve written about infinite heartbeats elsewhere&#8230;) Here&#8217;s my advice. If you know the ending in any way, shape or misty form, write it.</p>
<p>Why? Well, the only analogy I have is this one. You&#8217;re in a tub. You&#8217;re reaching for the rubber ducky. You can&#8217;t reach it. You panic. Your wild gestures and flailing create waves that push the ducky farther from you.</p>
<p>By writing the ending, you&#8217;ve already got the rubber ducky in hand. It&#8217;s done. The action is known.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s the wrong ending, it&#8217;s fixable, but meanwhile you&#8217;ve got a finished action of some sort, duck and all.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rubber duck metaphor, however, isn&#8217;t the one I want to end on. In fact, I don&#8217;t want to end on how we navigate the middle of a novel. I want to circle back to wanting for a moment because wanting isn&#8217;t just something we shouldn&#8217;t tamp out. It&#8217;s something that we should tend and care for and nurture within ourselves. Or, maybe, it&#8217;s something we should fire and stoke. Wanting provides the urgency that the page demands.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m going to err as a writer, I don&#8217;t want it to be because I was cautious with my heart, that I loved writing a little but never too much.</p>
<p>My resolution is to want to write, to desire it, deep down. To be jealous of my time with the page when I&#8217;m away from it. To long for it. To be torrid. To love it too much and to accept the pain that might come from that.</p>

If you&#8217;re a part of the WU Facebook scene (and if you aren&#8217;t, <a href="http://writerunboxed.com/what-you-should-know-about-wus-facebook-group-aka-the-best-writing-group-on-the-interwebs/">remedy that pronto</a>), then you are surely familiar with Jo&#8217;s name; she frequently provides helpful advice and encouragement for others there. If you don&#8217;t yet know Jo, let me make a prediction: You&#8217;re going to love her. It&#8217;s nearly impossible not to. I had the pleasure of meeting her this past year at the Un-Conference, and was struck by her effervescent, warm personality (not to mention <a href="http://writerunboxed.com/jo-2/">her magical red hair</a>). When an opportunity opened up here at WU, I thought first of Jo&#8211;writer, mother, Australian adventuress, and already one of us.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve introduced you to her, she&#8217;s going to introduce you to something else. Take it away, Jo, and welcome to WU!</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>When was the last time you sat and watched ants?</p>
<p>As a child, I could do it for hours. Or what felt like hours to a small, non-time-telling version of me. I&#8217;d sit and watch a line of ants walk across the grass, and then follow the line one way and then the other, working out where they came from and where they were going. But then I grew up, and ant-watching became just another hobby left behind as I moved from childhood through adolescence and into adulthood.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>Fifteen months ago, I threw in the towel on my suburban life and moved to live in a caravan in the bush. Since then, I&#8217;ve rediscovered a lot of my childhood joys, largely by watching my children discover the same ones, and shamelessly copying them. These days, I build stick-houses for fairies, find shapes in the clouds, and make up stories about the water dragon who lives in the creek. And, of course, I watch ants.</p>
<p>And because I&#8217;m me, watching ants soon transitioned into experimenting with ants. What would happen if I lay down a trail of breadcrumbs for them? Would they follow it?</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: The answer is yes.</p>
<p>With a trail of breadcrumbs, I could lead them anywhere. First one ant, and then another, would find the first breadcrumb. A bustle of activity would run up and down the line. And then the trail of ants would split, some ants continuing on their original mission while others went to investigate this new, tasty treat to be taken home and put in the ant-parlour for later consumption.</p>
<p>Eventually, I took the experiment to the next level. I set up my trail of breadcrumbs, and then finished it with a larger piece of bread. Then, I watched the ants swarm.</p>
<p>As you probably know, ants can carry up to fifty times their own weight. But if something is too big for them, too awkward, they don&#8217;t just let it lie. They gather their ant-cohorts and they patiently work at bringing the whole thing back home. One piece at a time, if necessary.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the way I develop ideas for stories.</p>
<p>Come on, you knew that was coming.</p>
<p>There I&#8217;ll be, minding my own business, when all of a sudden I see or hear something, and BANG. A story breadcrumb. My thoughts swirl around it eagerly, getting a feel and a taste for it. Then I follow it to the next breadcrumb, and the next, and the&#8230; You get my point.</p>
<p>Breadcrumbs can appear any time; often when you least expect it. For example, a couple of months ago I found one lurking in the “trending articles” list of my Facebook feed. My eyes skimmed over it, and I started to scroll down, and then&#8211; BANG. I was jolted back to the headline.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Logan International Airport: Nude suspect assaults 84-year-old man after falling through ceiling.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>A breadcrumb.</p>
<p>My thoughts raced, searching for the next breadcrumb on the trail to this story. Maybe the guy was a time-traveller, sent back into the past to prevent some terrible event from occuring. No, poor Sarah Connor deserves a break.</p>
<p>Maybe he was a member of an ancient druidic order intent on creating world peace by having druids perform mystical rites in the ceilings of all international airports simultaneously, and when this hapless druid (with anger management issues &#8212; ironic, yes?) fell through the ceiling mid-rite, he opened a rift in reality to another, more terrifying, world. And now, all hell is about to break loose.</p>
<p>I can hear the melodramatic movie trailer already.</p>
<p>Or maybe <a href="http://mlswift.me/">Mike Swift</a> was right when he pointed out that the guy was probably a psycho stalker on drugs. But that&#8217;s okay. There&#8217;s a story there, too. You just have to keep following the breadcrumbs.</p>
<p>And, speaking of flash fiction (What? We weren&#8217;t? Did you not notice my seamless segue?), I&#8217;d like to officially welcome you to the&#8211;</p>
<h3><strong>2015 Writer Unboxed Flash Fiction Contest!</strong></h3>
<p>&#8220;A contest?&#8221; you say. &#8220;How does it work?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad you asked.<span id="more-34935"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>On the first Saturday of each month between now and November, we&#8217;ll post a prompt. <strong>Your story must be inspired by each month&#8217;s visual prompt.</strong></li>
<li>Each submission must be <strong>250 words or fewer</strong>. The restrictive word count means that each word is crucial. Also, 250 words fits nicely into the comment section.</li>
<li>Each story must contain a <strong>beginning, middle, and end</strong>. Like all stories, a compelling narrative is essential.</li>
<li>All submitted work <strong>must be original</strong>, not published elsewhere, and written by you, for this contest. After the contest, what you do with your story is up to you; we hold no claim on your work.</li>
<li>Post your submission in the comment section of the prompt post. Each month, the deadline will be <strong>one week</strong> after the prompt is posted, meaning 7 a.m. EST on the second Saturday of the month. Stories posted after that time will not be eligible for the contest, but feel free to post them anyway &#8212; we&#8217;d love to read them.</li>
<li>No more than two entries per person, per prompt will be eligible for that month.</li>
<li>The winning story each month will be selected by a mix of votes in the form of Likes in the comment section (remember to <strong>Like your favourite stories</strong>!) and our own discretion.</li>
<li>Each month&#8217;s winning story will be announced the following month, and republished on Writer Unboxed, along with the author&#8217;s bio, and links to the winner&#8217;s website and social media accounts. As well as this platform-raising exposure, the monthly winner gets bragging rights and the exclusive opportunity to compete for the grand prize in December.</li>
<li>In December, the eleven monthly winners will be asked to write a new flash fiction story based on a new prompt. The overall winning story will be selected by a mix of votes via a poll and our own discretion.</li>
<li>The overall winner of the 2015 Writer Unboxed Flash Fiction Contest will be announced by the end of December 2015, and will win a fabulous Mystery Prize Pack. (Trust me when I tell you it&#8217;s even better than bragging rights.) The other ten finalists will also receive runner-up prizes.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what are you waiting for? Below you&#8217;ll find this month&#8217;s picture prompt; a breadcrumb for you to follow all the way to your story. Good luck, and may the ants be with you.</p>

<p>I know, I know—an article in early January about New Year’s resolutions? How original is that? But I happen to be a list maker junkie and New Year’s resolutions are the mother of all lists, so I can’t help it. I look forward to setting new goals, charting my progress, marking off the accomplishments on the list (yes, I’m a geek). Lots of people despise resolutions and feel they set us up for failure, disappointment, and self-loathing (and who needs any more of those?), so if it’s not your thing, no worries. They work for me, and my only hard and fast motto for this crazy business of writing is “whatever works.” If making writing resolutions sounds like something that might galvanize you, too, then here are some tips that make your resolutions more likely to stick.</p>
<p><strong>START WITH THE REVERSE OF RESOLUTIONS</strong></p>
<p>While it <em>is</em> important to challenge ourselves, it’s <em>just as</em> important to acknowledge the things we <em>already</em> accomplished. I know, I know, we are taught not to “toot our own horn,” but really, it’s good to take a look at all you’ve done in the course of a year—good for the soul, good for the ego, just plain good any way you look at it. Take an indulgent, congratulatory look at all the cool stuff you did between this year and last. It will make you feel proud, it will make you feel kinder towards yourself, and it’s a nice affirmation.</p>
<p>Some years, your list might include more “biggies” than others, for example “I landed an agent,” or “I published my fifth novel,” or, for me, 2014 included “I finally started teaching online writing classes after people have been bugging me to for years” (I have brand new ones beginning January 15 if you’re interested&#8230;) and “finished a draft of a new novel.”</p>
<p>But be sure to include accomplishments no one else might recognize or know about, such as: “Never got lost a single time while renting a car on book tour” or “Stopped going to writing group with X because it was toxic and not giving me anything.”</p>
<p>You get the idea. Nothing that comes to mind is too small to include. Sometimes, on discouraging days, it helps to go back and read your list—especially on days you feel you aren’t living up to your resolutions. You’ll go over your list and think, “Look at me. Look at all I did. Okay, tomorrow is another day. I’m inspired to do better.”</p>
<p>Start making <em>your</em> list. Look at you! Look at how strong, kickass and interesting you are!</p>
<p>Don’t you feel better already?</p>
<p><strong>MAKE SURE THE OUTCOME IS IN YOUR OWN HANDS</strong></p>
<p>As you make a list of resolutions for your writing life in 2015, don’t allow anyone else to control your success or failure. It’s not a good idea to resolve “I will be published in 2015” or “I will become a bestseller in 2015” because that outcome is not something <em>you</em> can actually control. <span id="more-34884"></span>Publishing can be a capricious and crazy-making business. If you want to be published, list resolutions such as “I will create an excellent query letter for my novel” and “I will submit queries to agents beginning in March” or what have you. Those are things that will certainly set you on the path to publication, but more importantly, they are goals <em>you</em> control.</p>
<p><strong>MAKE YOUR RESOLUTIONS CHALLENGING BUT DOABLE</strong></p>
<p>Both parts of that sentence are important. Challenging is key. It’s one of the reasons people bother to make resolutions at all—you are trying to kick start your productivity, get yourself out of your comfort zone, push yourself in some way. But don’t set yourself up for failure by setting insane and impossible goals. In my Inspiration &amp; Motivation class, I first coach students to carve out a writing schedule and keep it sacred. It’s a mistake for a relatively new writer to declare “I will write every day for four hours.” They’re not likely to sustain that kind of discipline, and then, after a week or so of failing to live up to that resolution, chances are they scrap the whole idea. Make your goal <em>doable</em>, and if you find you are accomplishing your goals with flying colors, celebrate it (more on that later) and then raise the bar for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>KNOW THY ENEMIES</strong></p>
<p>Chances are, there are reasons why you haven’t already met this particular goal you’re resolving to meet; that’s why you’re resolving to do it now. It’s crucial to assess and be aware of the enemy to meeting this goal. Another exercise we do in my Inspiration &amp; Motivation class is to identify what has kept you from meeting your goal in the past. What do you foresee being an obstacle to meeting your goal in 2015? First, identify it. Then, decide what preemptive plan will prevent this same obstacle from foiling you again. You have to be brutally honest and defensive. I’ll admit it: Facebook was/is a huge enemy to my writing time and productivity. For me, it’s a rabbit hole, a giant time suck. So, for starters, my plan was to set a stopwatch when I logged in so I could track my time, kind of like punching a time card. Well, that didn’t work! I’m embarrassed to say that I’d tell myself “I’m just going to change my status and answer messages and I’ll be off in ten minutes,” but the reality was (revealed by my stopwatch) that an hour would go by! So, I began to use my timer instead, and set an alarm for ten minutes so the time couldn’t slip away. Which leads me to&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>HAVE MONTHLY CHECK-INS TO SEE HOW YOU’RE PROGRESSING TOWARD YOUR GOALS</strong></p>
<p>You need to set time to assess how you’re doing. I was able to see my little time card plan was a bust and figured out something else. Seems obvious, I know, but if you don’t actually set a time to take a good objective look at how you’re doing, you might end up spinning your wheels and reinforcing bad habits. Be willing to make changes. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results. Don’t be insane. But also&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>CELEBRATE EVERY SINGLE SMALL SUCCESS</strong></p>
<p>Don’t be stingy! Be good to yourself. Any time you can mark something off your list or you do a check-in and recognize you’re right on track, <em>celebrate it</em>. I firmly believe celebrating each small accomplishment keeps them happening, and all those small steps build up to big leaps. Reward your writer self however you see fit—ice cream? A new writing book? A trip to a book store? A weekend writing retreat? Just as only you will know what your obstacles will be and what is doable for you, only you will know what is a worthy celebration.</p>
<p>Dan Blank wrote beautifully about this here last month in his post “Do You Have the Clarity to Celebrate Success?” (<a href="http://writerunboxed.com/2014/12/16/do-you-have-the-clarity-to-celebrate-success/#more-34735">http://writerunboxed.com/2014/12/16/do-you-have-the-clarity-to-celebrate-success/#more-34735</a>). If you didn’t read it then, I highly recommend you return to it now.</p>
<p>I wish you all the best with your writing projects in the New Year. May the words and inspiration flow for you in 2015!</p>
<p><strong>Will you track any of your writing goals this year? How? If you had goals for 2014, did you reach them?</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.” ~Henry David Thoreau</strong></p>
<p>For those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, we are just on the other side of the solstice, in the dark, dark days. Light is precious, especially when many of our waking hours are spent under low, heavy clouds, enduring winter storms, or in the lethargic state prevalent at this time of year. (Can you tell I need my happy light?)</p>
<p>I have great admiration for creatures who hibernate, but since I can’t cozy up in a cave to wait it out, I thought I’d look to the future for momentum. Like many others, I use this time to set my creative goals, which are two-fold: first, to get my forthcoming novel <em>The House of Hawthorne</em> (NAL/Penguin Random House, May 5<sup>th</sup>) into the hands of the <em>first </em>readers who would most enjoy it, and second, to complete a new historical novel that does not have a famous dead writer as a protagonist, but rather, a very specific setting and time period.</p>
<p>I asked a group of authors whom I admire to share their goals for 2015 with me. Their answers were humorous, heartfelt, reassuring, and inspirational. I hope they are for you, too.<span id="more-34927"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>“After two writing projects (let’s call them books) that didn&#8217;t quite gel, I’m hoping 2015 is the year that the third one is a charm.  Here’s to someone thinking what I’ve got is worth sharing and here’s to this next year being one where I can learn how to meditate for even ten minutes.” ~Lee Woodruff, NY Times Bestselling Author of <em>Those We Love Most</em></p>
<p>“I&#8217;ll be publishing my biography of Daphne Du Maurier in March 2015 in France and then hopefully in other countries. She is my favorite writer, a great inspiration for me, and writing her life was a tremendous experience.” ~Tatiana de Rosnay, Internationally Bestselling Author of <em>Sarah’s Key</em></p>
<p>&#8220;In 2015, I hope to finish work on my sixth novel, &#8220;The Painted Dove&#8221; about the French courtesan Marthe de Florian and the mystery of her Paris apartment that remained locked for 70 years.  I&#8217;ve been relishing working on a novel than spans the Belle Epoque to Paris just before its German occupation in WWII.&#8221; ~Alyson Richman, Bestselling author of <em>The Lost Wife</em></p>
<p>“The first order of business is to complete what I hope will be the final major rewrite of my new book, and then to herd the text through the gauntlet of line edits and copy edits that await. Oh yes, finding a title would be good, too. When I finally head into the foothills of my new project, I’ll be confronting the same old challenges, no less confounding for their familiarity: to find a healthy equilibrium between my writing, my family, and my legal career; to write with passion and humility and maybe the occasional pretty sentence; and to always, always tell the truth.” ~Alex George, Bestselling author of <em>A Good American</em></p>
<p>“I&#8217;m hoping not only to finish my new novel, but more importantly, to savor the process. As exciting as launching <em>Chasing the Sun</em> was in 2014, the real reason we do this is for the moments that happen on the page, so I&#8217;m making it a point to relish them.” ~Natalia Sylvester, Author of <em>Chasing the Sun</em></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;2014 was a year of waiting. Interminable waiting, it often seemed. In mid-summer I finished a first draft of my third novel. In the time since, I’ve waited for myself (to figure out how to fix what was wrong with the book), I’ve waited for my wife (to tell me what was still wrong with the book), I’ve waited for trusted friends (to help me fix what was still wrong the book), I’ve waited again for myself (for the time to fix all that was wrong with the book). And I’ve waited for agents and editors (to let the business end of this whole endeavor unfold). For much—maybe most—of the time I spent waiting, I was downright fretful. Naturally, I told myself over and over again. This was three years worth of work, after all. But all that waiting took its toll, and only as the holidays rolled around did I convince myself that the waiting is something almost entirely out of my control, and in order to restore my own peace of mind, I vowed to get to work on something new. Which I did. And so now I vow to relish the work and forget the waiting. In this game, you’re always waiting for something. The rewards can seem scant because of how much time passes between them. But the <i>pleasure</i>, that’s something that can be found anytime the fingers find the keyboard. And so I vow to make that time often, and to let that be the pleasure <i>and</i> the reward.&#8221; Peter Geye, Bestselling Author of <em>The Lighthouse Road</em>.</p>
<p>“I’m hoping to write more short stories in the New Year, and perhaps even publish some of them in a few journals and magazines. But good stories are hard to write, and that short story market is difficult to crack.” ~Wiley Cash, New York Times Bestselling Author of <em>A Land More Kind Than Home</em></p>
<p>“Every day since July 1, I have set a timer for 30 minutes. I write during this time, and on less-chaotic days, the 30 minutes extends into longer sessions. My goal is to continue my streak (I haven&#8217;t missed a day, yay), and produce my version of a readable draft by June 1.” ~Maryanne O’Hara, Bestselling Author of <em>Cascade</em></p>
<p>“With my next deadline looming, my very first goal is to finish my current novel, THE EDGE OF LOST. (If my editor is reading this, I swear I&#8217;m almost done!) Soon after, I&#8217;ll be diving into promo plans leading up to its November release while also researching and brainstorming for the next book &#8212; because who really needs sleep, right?  :)” ~Kristina McMorris, Bestselling Author of <em>The Pieces We Keep</em></p>
<p>“My 2015 goal is to finish a draft, maybe two, of my new novel, The Gypsy Moth Summer. Another goal of mine is to have a more complex story line in this next novel, and so I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about order of information, what info needs to be revealed (or withheld) from the reader, and when is the best time to reveal. I’d also like to do this without eating too many donuts, which helped fuel late night writing when I was working on my first novel, Cutting Teeth.” ~Julia Fierro, Author of <em>Cutting Teeth</em></p>
<p>“My goal for 2015: Basically I&#8217;m just going to walk the earth. You know&#8230; like Kane in Kung fu: walk from place to place, meet people, get in adventures. Visit Harlan Ellison. And write more short stories.” ~Jamie Ford, NY Times Bestselling Author of <em>Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet</em></p></blockquote>
