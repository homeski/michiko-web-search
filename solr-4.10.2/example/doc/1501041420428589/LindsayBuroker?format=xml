				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><p>I&#8217;m about ten weeks into my pen name experiment, which I first blogged about back in November: <a href="http://www.lindsayburoker.com/amazon-kindle-sales/pen-name-launch-first-month-earnings-marketing/">Pen Name Launch: First Month Earnings $3043 (what worked and didn’t for marketing)</a>.</p>
<p>The first book launched around October 10th at 99 cents and went permafree about a week later, at roughly the same time as I launched the second book. The third book was ready to go four weeks after that. On Christmas Eve, I launched a fourth book, but there hasn&#8217;t been time for it to do much, so today&#8217;s post will focus on the first three books.</p>
<p>For those curious as to the earnings, my pen name has made approximately $12,824.88 between October 10th and December 25th. (I say approximately, because the second and third books are in Kindle Unlimited, so I&#8217;m guestimating what the December borrows will be worth, based on November&#8217;s rate). Also, several regular readers emailed me after my last blog post on this matter, letting me know that they had figured out who my pen name was. I know some of them picked up books, so we could subtract $200 or so from the earnings, since those books would not have been sold if the pen name author was not me. As far as influencing Amazon rankings, I believe those sales were statistically insignificant (as of December 25th, only one LB book appeared in the also-boughts for the pen names books, and it was eight pages deep).</p>
<p>I revealed my pen name to my newsletter subscribers and Facebook followers yesterday, so whatever earnings and rankings come from these books in the future may be a little fuzzier. I don&#8217;t know how many of my fantasy readers will cross over and try the science fiction romances, but I would guess it to be less than 10%. That will be hard to judge, though, so this will be the last post where I can say that these results could be achieved by a brand new author, coming into this without a following or even any family/buddy early reviews starting out.</p>
<p>I detailed my launch strategy (such as it was) in my last post, so I&#8217;ll try not to repeat myself too much, but I&#8217;ll discuss the last 5-6 weeks or so, whether I experienced the 30 Day Cliff, and how I managed to &#8220;stick&#8221; in the Top 20 of my sub-genre for a good eight weeks or so before dropping. I&#8217;ll also talk about some of the things I could have done better, in the hopes that what worked and did not work for me can help others.</p>
<p><strong>Sales Rising and Falling with the Success of the Peramafree Title</strong></p>
<p>All of the books except for the first one are in KDP Select and Kindle Unlimited (so they&#8217;re exclusive to Amazon). I&#8217;ll go into the why later on, but let me talk about the book that isn&#8217;t first.</p>
<p>The first book in the series, Mercenary Instinct, has been permafree since the second week I released it. I made it 99 cents at Amazon and free at Barnes &amp; Noble, Kobo, iBooks, and Smashwords. Eventually, Amazon price-matched.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my last post, it did well as soon as it was dropped to free. Even though it wasn&#8217;t picked up by Pixel of Ink or any of the major sites that monitor such things, I think the 70 or 80 sales I manage to get while it was 99 cents helped thrust it onto people&#8217;s radars. Even though the cover art is just made with stock images, I think it&#8217;s better than a lot of what you see in the science fiction romance niche (admittedly, a tough genre to nail with stock art, since models so rarely dress suitably for a galaxy far, far, away), and I&#8217;m sure that helped get people to download it. It reached around 225 in the free list at Amazon and hung out in the Top 500 of its own accord for quite a while.</p>
<p>I did buy a few ads, the most useful being an Ereader News Today ad for $15. Later in the month, around Thanksgiving, I spent a whopping $85 for an ad on My Romance Reads. That was the most I spent on any ads, and it resulted in around 2,000 downloads, which was nice since the momentum had started to wane by that time.</p>
<p>In December, the freebie dropped further, hanging around 1,000 for a while, and it&#8217;s now dropped to 1600. A couple of days ago, I tossed $40 at eBookBooster to see if they could try to get it onto some sites that hadn&#8217;t already featured it. I also paid $30 at Kindle Nation Daily for a spot in their automated daily freebie roundup this weekend. I don&#8217;t think either service will give it a big boost, but maybe it will pop up a bit in the SFR free chart for a little longer.</p>
<p>Why bother?</p>
<p>As you might guess from the sub-title of this section, the sales of the second and third books have risen and fallen in sync with the freebie. As long as the freebie was getting a lot of downloads, the other books stuck in the Top 20 of the SFR sub-category on Amazon, which has resulted in steady sales. Lately, the books have been dropping off, appearing on the 21-40 page. They&#8217;re still selling &#8212; I can hardly complain about a 3,000 sales ranking (paid) in the Amazon store, especially when none of my LB books are in that range, except for the recently released Patterns in the Dark. But they haven&#8217;t sold as well as they did in November, when both were under 2,000 in the Amazon store for quite a while.</p>
<p>If my second and third books featured the same hero and heroine as the first book did, I suspect the sales would have been even better. Once of the tough parts of writing romances is that you typically wrap up the story at the end of the book and bring in different protagonists in future novels. All of the stories center around the same spaceship, and main characters become side characters in later books, so I&#8217;m sure that does help, but for those of you writing a clearcut series with the same heroes continuing the story from book to book, you might do much better than my pen name has done, especially if you can push a permafree Book 1 and keep it up there in the free rankings.</p>
<p><em>What I&#8217;ll be trying in the future with the permafree angle:</em></p>
<p>The big thing is that I&#8217;m mulling over making the first book $3.99 (the price of the others) after a while. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s much point in having a permafree that hangs out at 6,000 or some such in the free store. My Emperor&#8217;s Edge Book 1 is dealing with that now, after being free for years, and the sales have really dropped off on the rest of the series. I&#8217;m kicking around some ideas for bringing it back to life in 2015, but it&#8217;s definitely a challenge to keep even a <em>free</em> ranking up, because there are so many offerings out there. Also, for people who are KU subscribers, they have no need to browse the free books when everything in the KU store is essentially &#8220;free&#8221; for them.</p>
<p>If I revert <em>Mercenary Instinct</em> to a paid book, I&#8217;m thinking that I&#8217;ll either make something else in the series permafree for a while or I&#8217;ll use the Kindle Countdown Deals (an option for those in KDP Select) to temporarily make the other books free or 99 cents. One perk of this being an open-ended series, with different heroes in each one, is that people don&#8217;t have to have read Book 1 for Book 3 or 4 to make sense. So I do have the option of trying to get people into the series using the other titles. As I get more novels out, it may make sense to cycle between the first three or four, having a different one free at different times in the year.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s possible the pen name will get to the point where it has a big enough fan base that I don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to use permafree to gain momentum and keep relatively new releases in the Top 20 for the sub-genre, especially if I&#8217;m able to keep putting out books regularly. I would love to manage one a month, but I&#8217;m still writing books for my regular name, so it&#8217;s more likely that I will get a new novel out every 6-8 weeks. Still not shabby. We&#8217;ll see how things work out. In the end, science fiction romance is a small sub-niche, and the space operas I like to write are even smaller (I&#8217;ve been watching the Top 20 of the niche for a while, and the stories that are set on Earth, usually involving hunky aliens coming to visit, seem to be a much easier sell than the far-future outer-space stuff). I&#8217;m not sure how many readers there are, overall, to tap into. There&#8217;s a reason why the Big 5 doesn&#8217;t touch this niche.</p>
<p>Still, I&#8217;ve found a lot of people so far, and I can hardly complain about the early results!</p>
<p><strong>Launching with More Than One Title (and why I wish I&#8217;d had Book 4 ready to go sooner)</strong></p>
<p>A permafree alone doesn&#8217;t do much for you. As I&#8217;ve mentioned, one of the reasons the pen name books (2 and 3) sold decently right from the start is because Book 1 was free and a lot of free ebooks were being downloaded at the same time as I released Book 2. When I released 3 about four weeks later, the freebie still had some momentum. I did see some of that momentum wane in December, at which point I was basically ignoring the pen name stuff (not attempting to promo anything) and working on getting the new Dragon Blood book out.</p>
<p>I wish I&#8217;d had the fourth and fifth books in the pen name series ready to go like clockwork, 30 days after the release of the previous ones, as I think this would have helped keep the momentum going. No, not everyone writes that quickly, but if you&#8217;re launching something new, it might make sense to hold back on the release of that first title until you have some more in the pipeline.</p>
<p>I believe the reason launching with multiple titles really helps is because it gives you some more promotion options (you can make one free, or maybe trying some rolling Kindle Countdowns if you are in KDP Select), and it also gives readers more of a chance to connect with you as an author. A world or a set of characters is much more likely to stick in a reader&#8217;s head if they&#8217;ve read several of your adventures instead of just one. Assuming they like the experience, they will be more likely to remember you and seek you out in the future, even if they don&#8217;t sign up for a newsletter or follow you on the social media sites.</p>
<p>Also, when you&#8217;re releasing something every month, you have the opportunity to be featured as a hot new release in your category on Amazon. If you&#8217;re worried about falling off the &#8220;30 Day Cliff,&#8221; then having a new title to take the place of the old makes sense (I didn&#8217;t notice the cliff, but I think that&#8217;s because the permafree was what was feeding my Book 2 and 3 sales, rather than any particular loving from the Amazon algorithms).</p>
<p>Do you have to keep up this pace indefinitely? A book a month? I don&#8217;t think so. Ideally, you&#8217;ll reach a point where you have XXXX newsletter subscribers and so many people waiting for your new releases that even if you&#8217;ve got a 3- or 4-month gap between titles, your new releases should make it to the top of your category lists.</p>
<p>Of course, if you can put out a book a month, it can only help, especially if you&#8217;re writing in any of the romance sub-categories, where readers tend to be voracious. But it&#8217;s a pretty nutso pace for most people, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll drop back to one every other month or so, since I&#8217;ll be writing and releasing my usual LB fantasy novels too.</p>
<p>How often you need to publish to keep the momentum going likely depends on your genre. I&#8217;ve noticed that there&#8217;s a lot of churn in those romance categories, but in some other categories, where readers might take longer to consume books on average, it may be easier to stay in the charts without publishing every month (if you have thoughts on this, feel free to comment below!).</p>
<p><strong>How Kindle Unlimited Helped with the Pen Name Launch</strong></p>
<p>I talked about this in the last post, but right now, there&#8217;s an advantage for any author in Kindle Unlimited, because borrows get weighted as heavily as sales, insofar as your overall Amazon sales ranking goes (which affects how high up in your chosen categories you will appear). To get paid for borrows, a reader must get to the 10% point in the book, but right now, every single borrow that is made gives a boost to your sales ranking, regardless of whether the person reads any of it. (Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lindsayburoker.com/amazon-kindle-sales/kindle-unlimited-why-ebooks-not-enrolled-are-at-a-disadvantage/">my earlier post where I hypothesized about this</a>, and here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.selfpublisherbibel.de/test-how-amazons-algorithms-really-work-myth-and-reality/">a more scientific approach from a German publisher</a> that backs up my suspicions).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the big deal, you ask? A borrow is a heck of a lot easier to come by than a sale. As I mentioned above, for anyone enrolled in Kindle Unlimited, every book in the program is free under their $10 monthly fee. They can borrow 10 books at a time, and all they have to do is return one to grab another one. Just think about how you used to grab books off the shelves at the library (back before we were all doing this digitally). If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;d leave with a huge pile every time, even if you only ended up reading two of them. There was no punishment for checking something out, not getting past the first paragraph, and returning it, so why not do so?</p>
<p>In short, if you&#8217;re selling enough books to get into some Top 100 lists, being in KU can be a huge advantage right now, especially if you&#8217;re a new author. (As others pointed out on my earlier posts, being in KU doesn&#8217;t do much at all if you&#8217;re <em>not</em> moving enough copies to make those lists and show up in other authors&#8217; also-boughts.)</p>
<p><em>Will my pen name stay in KDP Select indefinitely?</em></p>
<p>I doubt it. Even though I&#8217;m talking about the advantages right now, I believe that if you&#8217;re trying to build a career and want this to be a reliable source of income, then it doesn&#8217;t make sense to rely completely on Amazon. With my LB books, I could pay my bills and make a living (albeit a more modest living), based on my iBooks/Smashwords/Kobo/Audible/CreateSpace(paperback) sales. Even though I sometimes lament that I&#8217;m missing out on the opportunities that being exclusive offers (for the moment), I feel a lot more comfortable knowing I wouldn&#8217;t be dead in the water if Amazon decided to freeze my account tomorrow or if Amazon suddenly decided all ebooks only receive 35% royalties instead of 70%.</p>
<p>Because I don&#8217;t depend on the pen name income, and because KDP Select offers tools that help a new author with visibility, those books are in the program for now. I do plan to start cycling some of them out later in 2015. As long as being in there is an advantage, I&#8217;ll probably put new releases there, but I think these titles could do well on other sites too, especially since the first book is already out there as a permafree.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media and Mailing Lists &#8212; did I use them?</strong></p>
<p>I talked about this in the earlier post, so I&#8217;ll keep this brief, but I did start a mailing list and website for the pen name. Right now, I&#8217;m only giving information about book releases on the blog, and I send out a newsletter when I have a new release. There are 120 subscribers, so far.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m debating if I&#8217;ll give away a free novella or something like that in the future, as an incentive to get more people to sign up for the list. I haven&#8217;t done that with my regular list, but I know a lot of authors do give away extras, designed to entice existing fans onto the list (i.e. You finished the first book and want an extra epilogue with these characters? Sign up here&#8230;). I wouldn&#8217;t bother trying to get people onto the list who haven&#8217;t read at least one of the books, such as by giving away gift certificates or the like. Those guys don&#8217;t usually stick around, and they&#8217;re not the true fans you really want to gather to you.</p>
<p>As for social media, I haven&#8217;t done anything yet. I may do a Facebook page eventually, just because I enjoy sharing snippets of the works-in-progress, but as far as promotions go, I&#8217;m seeing that social media can help but that it isn&#8217;t necessary for every author. If you write fun stories and you&#8217;re prolific, you can probably focus on putting out good books frequently and on taking advantage of advertising and less time-intensive methods of increasing visibility at Amazon.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising &#8212; how much did I spend?</strong></p>
<p>Less than $200. For kicks, I tried to get a Bookbub ad for the permafree, but they rejected me. It&#8217;s probably just as well since I&#8217;d have to put these under science fiction, there being no SF romance category, and I&#8217;m not sure how many of those readers would turn out to be romance fans too. ENT, at $15, was the best deal, and My Romance Reads did decently, though I suspect that site is better for contemporary romance authors. I&#8217;ll see how the eBookBooster thing goes (these guys, for $40, submit to a big pile of the sites that will mention your free book for free), as some of those plugs should come out in the next week or two. Overall, though, I didn&#8217;t spend a lot, especially not when you consider the overall earnings in the last couple of months.</p>
<p><strong>Cover Art &#8212; anything special?</strong></p>
<p>A few people mentioned this in the comments of the last update, that I had money to spend on really professional covers (they hadn&#8217;t seen my covers yet at this point, har). With few exceptions, these are the cheapest covers I&#8217;ve had made. They&#8217;re completely based on stock photos. I&#8217;m lucky that this is pretty much what everyone in the genre does, unlike epic fantasy, where custom illustrations are common (and expensive).</p>
<p><strong>So what&#8217;s the pen name&#8230; name, anyway?</strong></p>
<p>For those who want to check things out, here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Lionsdrake/e/B00P2NEY6G/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1">the author page for the pen name</a>. As I mentioned, the genre is science fiction romance (specifically space opera romance, so it&#8217;s a tiny niche, but I think it&#8217;s a lot easier to gain visibility if you can come on strong in a small niche).</p>
<p><strong>Will there be more updates?</strong></p>
<p>I just released a fourth book, and I&#8217;m enjoying writing these stories, so the pen name will continue. But since I&#8217;ve now shared the name with my regular readers, future results wouldn&#8217;t be as pure, insofar as the new-author-starting-from-scratch concept goes. I&#8217;m planning to continue to blog about how things go, though, most likely sharing what I&#8217;m doing with KDP Select and Amazon-specific promotions. So if that&#8217;s of interest, please stay tuned in the new year!<br />

<p><em>Everyone knows dragons have been extinct for over a thousand years. Everyone is wrong. At least one dragon remains, and military scientists from the Cofah Empire are experimenting with its blood, using the magical substance to power deadly new weapons that could be used to bring the world to its knees. </em></p>
<p><em>That&#8217;s a concern for Zirkander, Cas, and the rest of the Iskandians, but all Tolemek wants is to find his missing sister. The last time he saw her, their father had locked her in an asylum because of a mental illness with no cure. Now the military has taken her. What use the Cofah have for her, Tolemek can only guess, but he is certain she is in danger. He must save her before it&#8217;s too late. But her fate is inexplicably tied to the dragon&#8217;s, and he must find it to find her.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><p>If you&#8217;ve been following the blog and Twitter, you may have heard me mention my pen name project. I haven&#8217;t shared the details with many people &#8212; mostly just my editor and beta readers &#8212; because I wanted to see if I could start from scratch today and do reasonably well as a &#8220;new author.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have a breakdown of sales and borrows farther down, but the quick summary is that I earned about $3043 in the first month, most of that coming from one book (but that book being bolstered by another free one). The book was priced at $3.99, participated in KDP Select (and therefore Kindle Unlimited), and received 638 sales and 683 borrows between October 17th and November 16th.</p>
<p>Note: I&#8217;m using the $1.33 October figure to calculate earnings from borrows. If that drops in November, it might knock off $100 or $200 from my earnings estimate here.</p>
<p><strong>The multi-book launch strategy</strong></p>
<p>I knew it would be hard gaining any momentum with just one book, so I planned from the beginning to launch with three, with the goal of putting out another novel (or at least a novella) each month after that. I wrote the rough drafts for the three novels this summer, but of course I was working on my own LB novels at the same time. By the time the pen name books were beta read and edited, it ended up being more of a launch with two novels with the third coming almost a month later (it went live on Friday night, November 14th, and had 79 sales and 59 borrows Sunday night when I tallied everything). But at least I had two books to work with from the start and that was key in gaining some momentum.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at what I tried for marketing, what worked and what didn&#8217;t, and what I didn&#8217;t bother with.</p>
<p><strong>Pre Launch</strong></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want to make a whole second persona that I would have to manage, so I didn&#8217;t sign up for any of the social media sites with the pen name. I did put up a website, using WordPress as the backbone, and started a mailing list with the sign-up form on the front page of the site. I put some samples chapters up on the blog, but I don&#8217;t think that did anything, since nobody knew the site existed yet.</p>
<p>So far all I&#8217;ve done on the blog is post release information. Honestly, because I already sink time into my posts here, that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m planning to do in the future.</p>
<p><em>Wattpad Experience</em></p>
<p>In the hope of finding some people who might review the first book when it launched, I made a Wattpad account for my pen name. I started posting chapters as soon as I had the rough draft finished (around July) and updated regularly to try and get some early fans. There were a handful of people who found it and followed along, but I never gained much traction on Wattpad. I had a few positive comments from the people who did read it, but part of the trouble, I believe, is that the novel has R-rated material in it, so I had to check the R-rated box. On Wattpad, users have to specifically checkmark that they&#8217;re looking for adult content in order to see it, and I don&#8217;t think they even see that option if they&#8217;re younger than 18 (perfectly understandable).</p>
<p>(For those who are wondering at the how and why the pen name came about, I got some backlash from readers last spring when I published <a href="http://www.lindsayburoker.com/fantasy-novels/steampunk-romance-balanced-on-the-blades-edge/">Balanced on the Blade&#8217;s Edge</a>, a steampunk romance which had a sex scene in it. Even though I haven&#8217;t exactly been a prude in my other novels, most of them are less detailed in that area. I decided to split things off and use the pen name to write stories that include more, ahem, naughty bits.)</p>
<p>I <em>have</em> heard of authors gaining a good-sized following when they have R-rated content on Wattpad (even though there&#8217;s a large user base of teenagers, I learned in an <a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/01/31/wattpad/">interview with a Wattpad representative</a> that there are also some 20+ readers), but I should point out that I am writing in a <em>small</em> niche here. There are some voracious readers (i.e. the types of people who go through a book a day) in it, but it&#8217;s quite a limited pool of people overall. I wouldn&#8217;t have tried jumping into this niche at all if Amazon hadn&#8217;t finally made a subcategory for it about a year ago.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m debating here whether to share the niche, but because I&#8217;m still incognito with the pen name, I think it would be pretty easy for curious people to go find me if I talked about it here. By the end of this post, you might be able to guess anyway, but I&#8217;m going to wait another month before going public, as I want to see how the &#8220;30 Day Cliff&#8221; and other things effect the pen name before muddying the waters as to where readers are coming from.)</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t say that Wattpad was a total waste of time, but it was pretty close, at least in this case. I ended up with two pre-launch mailing list signups, and I don&#8217;t think anyone commented more than twice over the course of the novel, so I didn&#8217;t feel we had enough of a relationship for me to send them private messages and ask if they would like review copies of the final book.</p>
<p>The other thing I did with the pen name was join Romance Divas, a forum where self-published and traditionally published authors hang out. I had a notion of maybe finding some readers there by chatting about the industry and including a link to the Wattpad chapters in my signature (with a promise of review copies for anyone who was interested), but I didn&#8217;t end up posting there that much, as it felt weird to chime in and give advice on self-publishing and marketing when I was, for all they knew, an utter nobody without any books out.</p>
<p><em>In short, very little that I did pre-launch mattered.</em></p>
<p><strong>Launch Week</strong></p>
<p>On October 11th, 2014, Book 1 went live for 99 cents at Amazon and for free at Smashwords and Kobo (I ticked the distribution box, so it would eventually end up at Barnes &amp; Noble and Apple for free as well). I knew I was going to launch the rest of my books in KDP Select so I could take advantage of the way Kindle Unlimited borrows count as sales (for more details, see my earlier post on <a href="http://www.lindsayburoker.com/amazon-kindle-sales/kindle-unlimited-why-ebooks-not-enrolled-are-at-a-disadvantage/">Kindle Unlimited: Why Ebooks Not Enrolled Are at a Disadvantage</a>), so the only reason I was putting Book 1 in the other stores was so it would be made free on Amazon.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure how long it would take for Amazon to price-match the first book to free, but I didn&#8217;t expect it to happen quickly. It&#8217;s generally been my experience that already-popular books get price-matched almost right away, whereas it can take much longer for books that aren&#8217;t selling.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t planning to do any marketing whatsoever of Book 1, since there was little point until I had Book 2 out, and since it wasn&#8217;t as if I would make much money with it at 99 cents. But a few people found it within 24 hours of publication (okay, three) and apparently liked the 99-cent price tag enough to give it a try, even though it was by a new author. That got me a little excited (yeah, I know, it doesn&#8217;t take much), so I decided to see if I could find any place to advertise.</p>
<p><em>Attempts at Advertising Book 1</em></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve tried to buy advertising lately, you probably already know that there aren&#8217;t many places that will plug books with no reviews and on short notice. I was also limited by the fact that these books don&#8217;t fall neatly into any of the categories that book blog sites offer, so I stuck with sites that basically just say, &#8220;Yo, this stuff is free/99 cents today &#8212; go get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>That first weekend, I paid $5 each to <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/bknights">bknights</a> and <a href="http://www.kboards.com/index.php?topic=181784.0">genrepulse</a> through Fiverr. Bknights has a site where he posts free and 99 cent ebooks, and GenrePulse (which has since moved off Fiverr, but still offers the same service) plugs your book through his Android and Kindle Fire aps. I had heard about these guys on Kboards.</p>
<p>I think I can attribute about 10 sales to each service (they went out a day apart). This was enough to get the book into the Top 100 for the subcategory. It currently takes a 9300 sales ranking to hit the #100 spot (that makes the category sound more popular than it is, but there are a ridiculous number of books in it that don&#8217;t belong there, and yes, it&#8217;s irritating).</p>
<p>I bought a couple more ads from places that accepted books but that had more of a delay. None of them went live until the book was free, something that happened after about six days.</p>
<p>Overall, I spent about $50. The only other site that gave me results worth mentioning was <a href="http://ereadernewstoday.com/bargain-and-free-book-submissions/">Ereader News Today</a>, which currently allows you to plug a free book for a mere $15. This was a deal as I ended up getting over a thousand downloads that day from their site (even though the book ran with a big pile of other free books). I&#8217;m sure people publishing in more popular genres would get <em>many</em> thousands of downloads.</p>
<p>I should mention that the book got as high as 225 in the free list of its own accord when it first went free (before the ENT ad kicked in). I think that it helped that I had actually sold some copies at 99 cents before it went free. I also made sure to use the <a href="http://www.lindsayburoker.com/tips-and-tricks/book-more-categories-amazon-with-keywords/">right keywords to have it listed in about five different subcategories</a>, rather than the two Amazon gives you in the dashboard. (I admit I was a little nervous about adding those extra action-adventure types of categories, because even though the story surely qualifies, there are a lot more male readers browsing those other subcategories, and this was also clearly a romance. But overall, the experience has been positive, and I got some nice emails from male readers who probably would never have wandered over into the romance subcategory to look for it.)</p>
<p>As I write this now, Book 1 has dropped to 528 in the free store, but I have an ad coming up later in the month on <a href="www.myromancereads.com/advertise/">My Romance Reads</a> that may give it another nice boost. After that, I think I&#8217;m going to put the book back to 99 cents, rather than keeping it permanently free. Since the other books are in KU, I can play around with free or 99-cent days on them when sales start to fall.</p>
<p><strong>How effective was permafree for selling copies of Book 2?</strong></p>
<p>I published the second book in the series on the night of October 16th (I don&#8217;t think it went live until the 17th). The day before that, the first book went free, so that was nice timing. I immediately added a link to the second book at the end of the Amazon version of the free book. (Note: the afterwords also include an invitation to sign up for my pen name&#8217;s mailing list.)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think permafree is nearly as effective as it used to be (there are more free books out there now; thanks to KDP Select making it easier for authors to make books free; the lists aren&#8217;t displayed as prominently as they used to be; and KU subscribers can essentially get all the &#8220;free&#8221; books they want for their $10 a month, so there&#8217;s no reason for them to browse the free lists anymore), but it was instrumental for me in my launch of Book 2, which jumped into the Top 100 of its subcategory right at the beginning.</p>
<p>It hung out in the 60-100 range for the first week, then gradually improved to make it into the Top 20. It topped out at 8 or so, which was about a 1350 Amazon sales ranking. It&#8217;s been around 2000 for a couple of weeks now, thanks in large part to the borrows. On sales alone, it wouldn&#8217;t have been anywhere near the Top 20, so I&#8217;ll thank KU for the extra visibility (even as I loathe this aspect for all of my other books, which aren&#8217;t in KU and which don&#8217;t get their sales rankings artificially propped up by borrows).</p>
<p>The book has been out for 30 days now, so I&#8217;m expecting to see it drop in rankings, as a result of the 30 Day Cliff, which I mentioned before. Countless authors have noted that books seem to get a boost in visibility when they&#8217;re first published on Amazon, but then start a downward descent after being out for a month. This doesn&#8217;t hold true for every book &#8212; some have enough sales momentum behind them that they keep going &#8212; but it&#8217;s true in enough cases that just about every author on Kboards knows exactly what you&#8217;re talking about when you mention it.</p>
<p><em>Permafree when Book 2 has different characters from Book 1</em></p>
<p>Even though having Book 1 free definitely helped me sell Book 2, I should point out that it wasn&#8217;t as effective as I think it would have been if Book 1 had left some things unresolved and 2 had picked up with the same characters. I am writing in a series, but all of the books stand alone and feature different main characters. Outside of writing serials that follow the same heroes across the different installments, it&#8217;s tough to get around this with romance-centric novels, where readers expect the hero and heroine to get together in the end. If you continue on, you&#8217;re not really writing a romance anymore, not to the formula anyway.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see from my numbers (below) that a relatively small number of people went on to buy Book 2 compared to the number who downloaded Book 1.</p>
<p>I do think more people &#8220;hoard&#8221; freebies these days, since there are just so many of them out there, and don&#8217;t try them right away (or ever), but I do see a much higher buy-through ratio with my <a href="http://www.lindsayburoker.com/fantasy-novels/the-emperors-edge-a-high-fantasy-novel-in-an-era-of-steam/">Emperor&#8217;s Edge series</a> where Book 1 is free and Book 2 continues on with the same characters.</p>
<p>On the plus side, because each novel stands alone with its own characters, I can experiment in the future with making different books in the series free or discounted &#8212; something that didn&#8217;t make much sense with EE, since it would be confusing for new readers to start with Book 4. With this series, there would be some spoilers for someone starting in the middle (the old heroes and heroines stick around as side characters), but it&#8217;s not as if there&#8217;s any surprise about whether or not people are going to hook up in a romance anyway.</p>
<p>Okay, this post has gone on forever, so let me include the numbers, for those who like that kind of thing, and then I&#8217;ll sign off on this subject for another month (I&#8217;m planning to post another update before I share the pen name with my regular readers around Christmas).</p>
<p><strong>Book 1 sales and free downloads (Oct 10th to Nov 17th):</strong></p>
<p>Sales at 99 cents: 89</p>
<p>Free downloads at Amazon to date: 14950</p>
<p><strong>Book 2 borrows and sales at $3.99 (Oct 17th to Nov 17th):</strong></p>
<p>Oct: 166 sales, 139 borrows</p>
<p>Nov: 472 sales , 544 borrows</p>
<p><strong>Book 3 borrows and sales at $3.99 (Nov 15th to Nov 17th):</strong></p>
<p>79 sales, 59 borrows</p>
<p><strong>Book 2 sales chart on Amazon, for those who are curious about the snapshot for the month:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.lindsayburoker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PenNameBookSalesAmazon1Month.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4908" src="http://www.lindsayburoker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PenNameBookSalesAmazon1Month-1024x535.jpg" alt="PenNameBookSalesAmazon1Month" width="500" height="261" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A couple of extra notes</strong></p>
<p>Books 1 and 2 have 50 reviews on Amazon now (and some on Goodreads as well), which I credit to making it clear in the back of the book that review copies were available to anyone who would post a review. I&#8217;ll likely take that out soon, since they have enough reviews now, but in the past, this is the kind of thing I would only put out to my mailing list. Since the pen name had two subscribers when I started, that seemed a little pointless. But I was more than happy to give away free copies to get some early reviews.</p>
<p>The mailing list is up to 58 subscribers (I sent out the first email on Saturday to announce Book 3).</p>
<p>I used my regular editor (who isn&#8217;t the cheapest out there), but I did go cheap on cover art, having someone make collages with stock photos. Even so, the covers are better than a lot of them in the subcategory. (This niche is probably one of the few out there where there&#8217;s still a lot of really awful cover art in the Top 100).</p>
<p><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Overall, I think the pen name is off to a nice start. As I&#8217;ve been saying, it&#8217;s not a very popular genre, but there&#8217;s something to be said for the big-fish-small-pond tactic. There will doubtlessly be indies who start in 2015 and rock it by publishing in a big, popular genre, but I&#8217;m <em>positive</em> it&#8217;s easier to get noticed today if you can find a subcategory that you want to write in and that has <em>some</em> readers but that isn&#8217;t super competitive. (The Big 5 publisher presence is entirely non-existent in my subcategory, presumably because they don&#8217;t think it represents a big enough market to bother with.) I would guess that if my pen name established herself here, then later moved into a more popular category that was closely related to this one (so readers would cross over), she would find it much easier to get the sales necessary to rank there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to stop talking about myself in third person now. Thanks for reading this beastly long post. Good luck with your own endeavors!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><p>The &#8220;KU Apocalypse,&#8221; as some writers have called it, has cut into the bottom line for many independent authors, especially those who have refused to participate in Amazon&#8217;s KDP Select program, because they&#8217;re not willing to go exclusive with the mega retailer. I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that the sales rankings on most of my books have taken a dive since the program launched this summer.</p>
<p>I thought I would write this post to offer some ideas for authors who are feeling the pinch and are staring at their sales reports, wondering what they can do to boost the income a little. I do a couple of these things already, mostly out of habit (as some of you know, I was a professional blogger/content creator for my day job before I could make a living from my fiction, and I watched what a lot of the internet marketing gurus were doing, even if I never fully immersed myself in that world), and because it just makes sense not to leave money on the table.</p>
<p>Before jumping in, I&#8217;m assuming that as an author, you already have a mailing list and a blog (and possibly other avenues of putting out content beyond your books). If you don&#8217;t, maybe this will give you another reason to rethink the decision not to have those things.</p>
<p><strong>1. Affiliate Income from Mentioning Your Books in Your Newsletter</strong></p>
<p>Every time I send out word of a new release to the readers who subscribe to my newsletter, I put the links to my books in the email, and for the Amazon pages, I use an affiliate link. (Not a member of the program yet? <a href="affiliate-program.amazon.com">Sign up here</a>.) This means I get 70% of the ebook price from selling a book on Amazon and also that I get another 7% or so (the percentage depends on how many products you sell in any given month) from the affiliate commission.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#8217;ve got four people on your mailing list and you&#8217;re selling seven books a month, you&#8217;re not going to make a big wad of dough doing this. But if you&#8217;re determined to become a career author, and you&#8217;re succeeding in slowly building up a mailing list and accumulating readers, then this extra money can add up eventually. As some of the ladies pointed out on the recent <a href="http://selfpublishingroundtable.com/70/">Mailing List episode of the Self Publishing Podcast</a>, this can end up covering all of the expenses associated with running a newsletter service and then some. (Many newsletters are free to start but then start to cost $XX/month as you acquire more subscribers.)</p>
<p>*Note: I&#8217;ve been too lazy to apply for the other stores, but Smashwords, Barnes &amp; Noble, Apple, and Kobo all have affiliate programs too.</p>
<p><strong>2. Affiliate Income from Mentioning OTHER People&#8217;s Books in Your Newsletter</strong></p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re prolific, there&#8217;s a limit to how often you&#8217;re going to release a new book, but common newsletter-publishing wisdom suggests that you stay in touch with your subscribers so they don&#8217;t forget about you (and then unsubscribe in a huff when they get a random email six months after they&#8217;ve signed up).</p>
<p>So what do you send them? If you&#8217;re reading widely in your genre and have some books you would be comfortable recommending, you can send them the latest title that rocked your reading world (with the affiliate code of course). You want to be careful here and not just send random books that you haven&#8217;t vetted, but readers are always on the lookout for more good books, and chances are, if they like what you write, they&#8217;re going to like a lot of the same types of books as you do.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;ve read so little fantasy of late, I haven&#8217;t done this much (I&#8217;m going to try it with my pen name&#8217;s mailing list, because I&#8217;ve actually read more in that genre in these last couple of years), but I <em>have</em> done this with some of my beta readers&#8217; books. We all write fantasy and have similarly quirky senses of humor, so I feel comfortable recommending their books.</p>
<p>If there are other independent authors you read and enjoy who write in your genre, you may even look into forming partnerships with them where they promote your new releases and you promote theirs.</p>
<p>I do think you have to be careful with these situations and make sure you&#8217;re still primarily giving your readers what they subscribed for &#8212; news about you and your works. What you can do when you&#8217;re plugging someone else&#8217;s book is also include an update about what&#8217;s going on with your own works in progress.</p>
<p><strong>3. Affiliate Links on Your Blog/Author Website</strong></p>
<p>I know, I know, you&#8217;re sensing a theme here&#8230; I&#8217;ll change it up after this, but let&#8217;s add this section too.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been thinking of starting a blog, but you&#8217;ve been told it&#8217;s not very effective at selling books, what  if you were also making money from other things? At the least, you could have affiliate links for all of your books, but if you&#8217;re the kind of person who reads a lot, you can also review other people&#8217;s books, the same as with the newsletter.</p>
<p>The difference between your website and a newsletter is that there&#8217;s less risk that you&#8217;re going to be &#8220;bugging&#8221; someone by putting something in their inbox that they didn&#8217;t ask for. Also, if you&#8217;re blogging about things people are interested in, you can get random traffic from the search engines with first-time visitors landing on your site, visitors who might never have heard about you otherwise. They might just check out your books while they&#8217;re there. (I don&#8217;t sell a <em>lot</em> of books through this blog, , but I <em>do</em> sell some &#8211; because of the affiliate links, I can tell where the sales originated.)</p>
<p>So, what do you write about on your site? Product reviews work great with ads and affiliate links. Ebooks aren&#8217;t the way to riches, since the affiliate commissions are going to be pretty low unless you&#8217;re selling $10 ebooks, but if you&#8217;re a tech lover, you might also review some of the latest products related to reading that you&#8217;ve purchased or had the chance to play with. I reviewed one of the kindles before the holidays one year and ended up making some nice commissions, since these were $200 products. Before Christmas, you&#8217;ll get a lot of people buying extra items on Amazon, too, and you make a commission on anything they buy within the 24 hours that they click on your link.</p>
<p><strong>4. Running Advertising on Your Blog/Site</strong></p>
<p>This is how I made a living when I was a professional blogger (thank you, Google Adsense). I don&#8217;t do it on my author page, because I don&#8217;t feel the need to and I also don&#8217;t want to send people away from my site (and my books), which is what happens when people click on an ad, but the tradeoff is that I don&#8217;t make much money from this site, despite putting time into it every week.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re producing content regularly and writing about more than your own writing struggles and book launches (as I mentioned, some people review books or other products), then it can make sense to add advertising to your site. If you&#8217;re a non-fiction author, this can be especially effective. Nobody&#8217;s out there bidding a lot for placement on ads about &#8220;fantasy novels,&#8221; but if you cover diet and fitness, home repair, travel, or even self-publishing, there are merchants with related products who want to advertise on your site.</p>
<p>Wet your feet with Google Adsense, and if you don&#8217;t mind giving up the real estate on your site and you have the traffic to support it, you can also sell banner or text links directly to interested parties (this takes more work since you have to <em>find</em> interested parties).</p>
<p><strong>5. Setting up a Subscription Model</strong></p>
<p>This is something I toy with every now and then but have never done myself. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m ready to take on the pressure of putting something out every month for reader-subscribers. But there is no steadier income than having subscribers who are automatically paying $X every month or quarter. The money is typically withdrawn from their account (Paypal has a subscription option) until they unsubscribe. And if you&#8217;re giving them what they want, they might stick around for a while.</p>
<p>So how would this work for an author? The guys over at the Self Publishing Podcast are so prolific that they started a subscription service for their &#8220;<a href="https://sterlingandstone.net/">Story Studio</a>&#8221; that allows their dedicated readers to get their newest content every month, often before they release it to the stores. I believe this is a fairly new endeavor for them, but it&#8217;s a way to bypass the retailers, sell direct to the customer, and earn more overall on your books.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t think you can put out a new novel a month? Yeah, that&#8217;s kind of crazy. But <a href="http://www.lindsayburoker.com/e-publishing/author-earning-money-through-monthly-short-story-subscription/">here&#8217;s someone else that I interviewed a couple of years ago</a> who uses a subscription model for short fiction.</p>
<p>The ultra prolific <a href="http://www.smithsmonthly.com/">Dean Wesley Smith puts out an entire magazine</a> of his own work every month.</p>
<p>A perk to starting a subscription service? The added pressure to produce! Okay, okay, that&#8217;s the same thing that has me leery of doing this, but if you need a reason to get your butt in the chair every day, the fact that people are waiting for the next story might just do the job.</p>
<p><strong>6. Get Support Directly from Readers with Patreon</strong></p>
<p>I first heard about this service from Joanna Penn, AKA <a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/">The Creative Penn</a>, who is using it to help cover the time she puts into publishing her free podcast. The site is called Patreon and its exactly what it sounds like, an opportunity for someone to act as a patron to support your work. There&#8217;s a long history of well-off individuals supporting artists and writers, but this brings it into the 21st Century, allowing anyone to support, by donating as little as $1 a month.</p>
<p>As an example, here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.patreon.com/thecreativepenn">Joanna&#8217;s Patreon page</a>, where people pay a dollar or two per podcast that she produces.</p>
<p>Personally, I like this more than the Kickstarter &#8220;crowd-funding&#8221; model, which is great if you genuinely need the money to make something happen, but can feel a little skeezy (yes, that&#8217;s a word) if you&#8217;re doing well financially and still trying to get people to back something.</p>
<p>I browsed through the writing category, and it looks like a lot of people are finding support for their web comics, but I bet someone publishing a novel to the web could find some supporters too. If the KU Apocalypse continues, maybe I&#8217;ll even give it a try!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all I have for today. If you&#8217;re doing any of these things, or doing something else, we would love to hear about it. Please comment!<br />
