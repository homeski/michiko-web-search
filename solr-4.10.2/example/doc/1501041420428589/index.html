<p>Isobel Spice is an aspiring actress, and office temp, and on occasion, an amateur sleuth. When she and her roommate, Delphi Kramer, agree to act in a murder mystery dinner theater performance to honor a well-known judge, a real murder happens, with the guest of honor as the victim. Isobel is then caught up in a maelstrom of lies, double-dealing, and corruption as she first has to clear her roommate, who is the initial suspect, and then sort through a growing list of possible suspects until she finally zeroes in on the most unlikely one.<br />
Justice for Some by Joanne Sydney Lessner is a rib-tickling murder mystery with a cast of the wackiest characters to appear in this genre in a long time. Lessner has a writing style reminiscent of Janet Evanovich; using what almost amounts to slapstick – but stopping just shy of the ‘slip on a banana peel’ brand of humor – to keep the reader laughing, while at the same time salting clues throughout the narrative for those who are paying close attention.<br />
This book has several interesting plot twists, and well-drawn characters that, despite the humor, seem true to life. The story is logically constructed, and flows like a mountain stream in a serpentine fashion to a logical conclusion. When Isobel unmasks the killer, you’ll feel like slapping your forehead and exclaiming, “Darn, how’d I miss that?”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are our last three great new stories for 2014. We look forward to bringing you many more next year. We&#8217;re planning on posting the new additions on the last weekend of each month from now on.</p>
<p>Some of the authors and I have been discussing just what it is that the Awesome Indies offers readers. I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s something like:  Cross-genre excellence. Evocative writing and great story telling, because that&#8217;s what we have here. We&#8217;re the place for those who want books that are not only as though provoking and well-written as literary fiction should be, but are also as exciting as genre fiction. No boring stuffy stuff here.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to get more books listed here, because I&#8217;m sure there are more out there that fit the bill, so if you know of an author who writes well and has great stories to tell, then send them our way. And if you are or know of someone who might be interested in joining our review team, send them to t<a href="http://awesomeindies.net/reviewers-needed/" target="_blank">his blog post on what we&#8217;re looking for</a>.</p>
<h2>YA Dystopian</h2>
<p><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Get-on-Board-Little-Children.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-10807" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Get-on-Board-Little-Children-200x300.jpg" alt="Get on Board Little Children" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>In a future marked by high-tech surveillance, an unlicensed pregnancy is a felony. It can lead to loss of the child as well as devastating fines and imprisonment. Targeted by the corrupt population-control police, Sophie must make a painful decision. She can submit to the state&#8217;s harsh demands. Or she can go on the run, relying on the conductors of the revived Underground Railway. Confronted with deception and violence, she must learn to trust her instincts. If she hesitates she risks the loss of everything she values most.<br />
Fast-paced dystopian thriller, GET ON BOARD LITTLE CHILDREN takes the heroine from the drone-watched streets of Seattle to the dangerous Tijuana border, while exploring a future that may be closer than we imagine.</p>

<h2>Mystery</h2>

<p>Actress Isobel Spice and her best friend Delphi Kramer are thrilled to finally have an opportunity to perform together, even if it’s just a cheesy interactive murder mystery at a judge’s lifetime achievement dinner. But when Isobel’s dramatic death scene is upstaged by a real murder and Delphi is left holding the still-smoking gun, Isobel drops the role of victim and assumes the role of detective.</p>

<td>THE RETAIL is a comedic satire of the big-box retail industry.</p>
<p>Aspiring writer Penn Reynard has just joined the ranks of America&#8217;s fifteen million retail workers: fresh out of college with an English degree, he can&#8217;t find a job anywhere except at the local big-box hardware store. Working returns, Penn experiences firsthand the often comical absurdity, chaos, and shenanigans of the retail world. At least he has a new romance with a coworker going for him—if he doesn&#8217;t screw it up. The constant pressures of dealing with hostile customers, oblivious coworkers, and overbearing management begin to take their toll on him, though, and as his desired career path threatens to fall out of reach, Penn struggles to break free of retail&#8217;s clutches.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what other people are saying about THE RETAIL:</p>
<p>&#8220;I love it, I love it, I love it . . . Rare is the occasion when you read a book that thoroughly delights you . . . Danker-Dake is a dialogue genius. He keeps a hilarious running dialogue practically the entire book.&#8221;<br />
&#8211;Carol Piner, The Kindle Book Review</p>
<p>&#8220;Danker-Dake needs to get out of Tulsa and start writing sitcoms in Hollywood. His hilarious new book, The Retail, could easily be a hit TV series. The characters are really quirky, yet everyone knows someone just like these guys. The dialogue is razor-sharp and enormously entertaining.&#8221;<br />

<td>I really enjoy strategic and tactical games—I’m the strategy and tactics editor for Diplomacy World, the flagship publication of the Diplomacy hobby. That’s a creative outlet both in that I’m regularly writing articles of a sort I wouldn’t otherwise write and in that strategy games require a certain amount of creativity—perhaps none more so than Diplomacy, which brilliantly combines tactical maneuvering with negotiation, deal-making, and outright lying.</td>

<p>Daemon Seer is an expertly written, highly engaging page turner that is much more than a simple thriller. Its smooth prose and superb handling of the nature of drug addiction and the after effects of trauma give it the quality of literary fiction. Daemons normally mark a book as fantasy, but this novel is too real for that label to do it justice; the daemon’s relationship to human depravity gives their presence more a metaphysical than a fantastical function.</p>
<p>The story is tight, tense and dark, but there is hope there, not the melodramatic kind, the real, hard-won kind born of the determination to survive and to keep caring. There are no quick fixes in this story, no easy answers and no saccharine endings. This is as messy and gritty as life must be when evil walks on two legs and is out to get you.</p>
<p>True 5 star books show their quality early on, and this one certainly did. The author’s ability to write clean, concise and elegant prose was immediately obvious. Her words flow with the confidence of a seasoned writer, and she expertly weaves description into the action in such a way that we feel we are right there in the action, experiencing the scenes with all our senses, not just reading about them.</p>
<p>By the 20% mark the author had the whole story set up. The protagonist and antagonist were clear, the main complications (the daemons and their relationship to the central character) were established, the game was set and I was already invested in Lu’s survival. This is how such books should be. The story and relationships became more complex as the book progressed and it built to a dramatic and powerful conclusion. I cannot fault the craftsmanship in this one at all.</p>
<p>Right from the beginning, there was never a moment where I was tempted to put the book aside, a sign of excellent pacing and engaging action. And the characters leap off the page as real people with believable flaws, insecurities, hopes and fears.</p>
<p>I highly recommend it for anyone who likes a good gritty thriller and I nominate it for an AIA Seal of Excellence.</p>

<div class="productDescriptionWrapper">
<p>From the winner of the 2010 Waverton Good Read Award comes another good read. Beth Jenkins – locum doctor, semi-bereaved wife – runs away from home at the age of twenty-eight and a half and becomes heroine of a revolution.</p>
<p>Locked into a lonely future by a cruel twist of fate, Beth reaches breaking point, leaves her husband, and flees to faraway Zimbabwe. But there she finds herself at the centre of a deadly struggle for the ownership of a farm. From a guest of honour at the President’s table to a disastrous decision that betrays a good man, her fresh start threatens to end in catastrophe. Does the land, and its painted rocks, hold clues to atonement and re-found love?</p>
<p>Fortunate is an intelligent, moving novel with a gripping plot about how to defy fate and about the relationship we have with the land we live on.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://geni.us/1xyc" target="_blank">99c on Kindle</a> until Dec 31st</h2>
<p><a href="http://tahlianewland.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6881 alignleft" src="http://tahlianewland.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB-198x300.jpg" alt="Worlds_Final-WEB" width="198" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><em>‘The barrier between the worlds shatters like the window. The beast is loose. My nightmare has become real. The guy has totally lost it. If he finds us here, we could die. No, I don’t doubt it; we will die.’</em></p>
<p>Author and editor Prunella Smith inhabits a multilayered reality. Physically, she lives in the Australian bush with her crazy cat Merlin. In her work world, she edits the love story of Kelee, a Magan Lord’s daughter, and in the cyber-world of social media, she’s subjected to slanderous attacks by a disgruntled author. To complicate matters further she sees things through the eyes of a Tibetan Yogi, has strange dreams and relives old memories.</p>
<p>Separate worlds, interconnected and complementary, but can they help when Prunella becomes victim to a real life stalker and her sanity is threatened?</p>
<p><em>Worlds Within Worlds</em> has a unique perspective on the nature of creativity. Its touch is light, its humour distinctive but it reaches deep into the nature of human experience.</p>
<p><em>“This is riveting stuff, part magical realism dreamscape, part taut psychological thriller, and I was literally on the edge of my seat when the final twist—and what a twist it is—came around. Phew, what a ride! I can honestly say it is the best book I have read this year.” Frank Kusy, author of Rupee Millionaires.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;This book will make you think. Considering the deluge of new works streaming from authors these days, that may be the highest praise a novel can receive.” Amy Spahn, editor.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Writers will appreciate Worlds Within Worlds for its exploration of the creative process. Intelligent readers will enjoy the memorable characters, the suspense, and the intricacies of Ella&#8217;s interlocking worlds.&#8221;  Amazon Vine Reviewer.</em></p>

<p>Awesome Allshorts showcases talented authors from around the globe, many whose novels have received multiple honors, including Awesome Indies approved status.</p>
<p><em>“An eclectic mix of short stories, from the mundane to the downright weird, these stories make the mundanity of day-to-day activities entrancing, or tell tales of other times and places. There&#8217;s something here for everyone. The stories are not only well selected, they are also well ordered. I think that&#8217;s a very important feature in a short story anthology. I thoroughly recommend this collection.” Illiterarty Reviews.</em></p>
<p><em>“I did not expect these stories to move me as deeply as they did. Short works often struggle to pack a significant punch in their diminished wordcount, but the pieces contained in this collection rise to the occasion. Some had me on the edge of my seat in suspense. Some brought tears to my eyes with their emotional depth. And some utilized unique writing styles so artfully that they should be studied in literature classes.” AI Reviews.</em></p>

<p>The Ghosts of Eden by Andrew J. H. Sharp is, like the story of Joseph’s coat from the Hebrew Bible, of many colors. It is a story that zooms back and forth in time and across strains of characters’ lives, at times with the speed of a supersonic jet, and at others, languidly like an eagle gliding on wind currents.<br />
On the one hand, it is the story of Michael Lacy, the son of English settlers in pre-independence Uganda, who at the opening of the story is a prominent surgeon in the UK. On the other, the story of the Katura brothers, Stanley and Zachye, two members of the Bahima tribe who are sent off to school to learn the ways of the Bazungu, or whites, in order to be able to survive in the Uganda that is to come.<br />
Although fictional, The Ghosts of Eden gives the reader an in depth look at African culture and the strains between traditional tribal culture, and the ‘modern’ culture imposed by colonization. The characters are so well formed, we feel as if we know them – their dreams and desires as familiar as our own. Told from a semi-omniscient point of view, the author nonetheless allows us to glimpse inside key characters’ minds, adding significantly to the tension that builds steadily from the moment Michael’s seat mate on the plane as he’s returning to Uganda to speak at a medical conference, dies quietly in his sleep. There is action and mystery aplenty in Sharp’s narrative, but this is also a love story – one with more twists and turns than an English garden maze as Michael, Stanley, and Zachye all vie for the heart of the beautiful, but enigmatic Felice.<br />
My only complaint about the book was the author’s habit of not indenting certain paragraphs within chapters, until I realized that this was signaling a change in the action. That realization came about a third into the second chapter, so this really doesn’t count as a distraction.<br />
The Ghosts of Eden defies genre characterization. Mystery, thriller, romance, historical novel, or perhaps a better description is literary tour de force. An exceptionally well-written novel that, once begun, is hard to put down until you arrive almost breathlessly at the end – and as you close it, you say, that’s the way it should be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/a-letter-to-amazon-from-the-awesome-indies/"><img width="890" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/070119j0267-890x400.jpg" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="Pencil on notebooks" /></a><div>This is a copy of the email our coordinator Tahlia Newland sent to Amazon via the KDP support team. Whether it gets to anyone who is interested or is moved to do something is yet to be seen, but the attempt has been made to make contact.</div>
<p>Hi KDP support team</p>
<div>Could you please pass this on to whoever is concerned about the plethora of poor quality books Amazon is offering its Kindle readers.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;m the coordinator of <a href="http://awesomindies.net/" target="_blank">Awesome Indies Books</a>, our purpose is to identify and promote self-published and indie published books that meet the same or higher standards as mainstream published books.  I&#8217;m pretty sure that someone in the Amazon organisation must be concerned about the lack of quality of a large number of the self-published books you offer your customers. I&#8217;ve heard Nook owners say, &#8220;Yes, Kindle offers more books, but most of them are crap.&#8221;  I figure that&#8217;s not so great for business in the long term.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t want to institute any kind of quality control from your end. It is unnecessary and would be detrimental to do so. The answer, I think, lies not in preventing the publication of poor quality books, but in making the quality books more visible, so they are the ones readers are more likely to find and read.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Any system working on such an idea immediately raises the question of what constitutes quality and who is qualified to evaluate. Amazon star ratings are well known to be unreliable. Much as we would like to be able to work from customer reviews, we can&#8217;t. Even if we put aside the sock puppet accounts and 5 star review purchasing, most reader/reviewers don&#8217;t leave a review unless they have something good to say, so a lack of low starred reviews does not mean that a book is as good as its rating suggests. So where can you turn to get an idea of the quality of a book? Book awards should be a reliable source for quality books, but awards that are voted on by readers merely indicate which authors have the biggest social media network that he or she can mobilize to go and vote.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/about/approved-reviewers/" target="_blank">The Awesome Indies reviewers</a> &#8211; those who assess books for approval &#8211; are editors, university lecturers, journalists, award-winning authors and others with degrees in English literature, creative writing or journalism. Such people are most able to evaluate quality in writing, and are those whose opinions are most likely to be respected. We also have a <a href="http://awesomeindies.net/about/the-criteria/" target="_blank">clear and relevant criteria</a> against which to evaluate.</div>
<div>BRAG is another organisation who highlights quality independent books, but their criteria is very loose. The indiePendents is another organisation trying to do something similar, but their criteria only relates to copy editing, not the other forms of editing that are so vital for fiction. Even so, any initiatives you undertake to draw readers attention to quality indie books could include books that they have approved as well, depending on how high you want to draw the line for quality.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So the Awesome Indies have solved the &#8216;who decides what&#8217;s good&#8217; issue. We can tell you which are the well crafted books (take a look at <a href="http://awesomeindies.net/about/the-criteria/" target="_blank">our criteria for approval</a>), all you have to do is work out &#8211; assuming that you do want to direct your customers to the best of indie publishing &#8211; how you can get these books in front of your readers in such a way that they will be more likely to buy them than their less polished counterparts.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;ll leave the &#8216;how&#8217; up to you. The point is that we have a well-thought out and reliable system for identifying well-crafted books, and I think it would benefit Amazon to make some kind of commitment to support quality in indie publishing. Give your readers a reliable way to sort the wheat from the chaff and they will be very happy. It would also be very good for public perception of your company.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I hope that you can see that a system that makes quality books more visible would be good for the customer, good for you and good for the indie publishing business as a whole. Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if the authors who work hard to write well, and who pay thousands of dollars for editing and cover designs had more of a chance to get a return for their investment than those who didn&#8217;t make the same kind of investment? Higher visibility for quality products is the only way to do that. And you can provide it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let me know if you&#8217;re interested in talking further about this.</div>
<div></div>

<p>“Night Watch” draws the reader into the action from the start, bonding them to the storyline with cliffhanger chapter endings, and keeping them on tenterhooks till the very end. The author uses her specialist knowledge of sailing to good effect, adding a sense of excitement, but is never at risk of alienating less well-informed readers.</p>
<p>The central character, Em Ridge, in her thirties, is recently widowed after a tragic boating accident. A newly qualified captain, she sets off from Canada to the Caribbean, in charge of her first commercial delivery of a luxury sailing ship. Not long after they depart, a crew member disappears – an incident that threatens to scupper Em&#8217;s career and reputation. Soon a bizarre connection emerges between this death and Em&#8217;s late husband’s, and the mystery becomes ever more complex, with Em&#8217;s life increasingly endangered.</p>
<p>Key themes include the nature of friendships and families &#8211; how well we really know each other and the difference between friends and families. Estranged from her own family, Em has formed close friendships with her neighbours who support her at times of crisis. The class distinctions and the ethics of the sailing community are explored, as is the meaning of true wealth. Also under consideration are the social mores of those who, like Em, choose to tread their own unconventional path.</p>
<p>The characters are engaging and well drawn. I especially enjoyed the portrayal of Em&#8217;s neighbours and of Ben, the new police officer who has moved to the area after a personal tragedy. Their relationships, dialogue and actions were believable and consistent, and I was rooting for Em right from the start.</p>
<p>The plot flowed well, but a number of minor typos drew me up occasionally—however, the author assures me that these have since been attended to. The style was natural and easy, and the only writing tic that I spotted was the habit of using &#8220;um&#8221; or &#8220;uh&#8221; or &#8220;ah&#8221; to make a speech sound hesitant. This made them sound phony; the speeches would have been just as effective without.</p>
<p>This was a gripping and satisfying read that would appeal to readers who are interested in leisure sailing, those who like cosy mysteries, and those keen on stories set on the eastern seaboard of Canada.</p>
<p>The ending was satisyfing and tidy, though my head reeled from so many twists and turns, none of which I&#8217;d predicted. Em&#8217;s personal growth, as she gains confidence in who she is and what she stands for, was rewarding for the reader. As we part company with her, she is set to move on beyond her bereavement, to advances in her career, and possibly to a new, cautious and gentle relationship with Ben.</p>
<p>The neat conclusion leaves a good set-up for a sequel. It’s always pleasing to discover an enjoyable new series, and I’d be keen to read what Em gets up to next.</p>
