<p>In Prunella Smith: Worlds Within Worlds, Australian writer Tahlia Newland addresses the timely problem of authors harassing, stalking, and even physically attacking reviewers who have panned their books. But this novel isn&#8217;t a lurid melodrama. It&#8217;s a contemplative story about the creative process that&#8217;s also, amazingly, a page-turner. I put everything else aside and read it in a single afternoon.</p>
<p>Editor and author Ella Smith lives with her cat in an isolated area of the Australian bush. She has one or two close friends and goes on an occasional date, but most of the time she&#8217;s alone. That&#8217;s how she likes it. Then she begins receiving email threats from &#8220;Dita,&#8221; an irate author whose book she reviewed. She has no idea who Dita is. He uses pseudonyms online and writes under a pen name.</p>
<p>Her response is to retreat into the inner worlds that nourish her creativity. A serious Buddhist, she meditates to overcome the fear and anger triggered by Dita&#8217;s threats. She doesn&#8217;t have time for them; a deadline is approaching for a major editorial project. Besides, what can he actually do to hurt her? She soon discovers that even in the abstract world of the Internet, Dita can inflict damage to her reputation and livelihood. He highjacks her Facebook account and bad-mouths her in online forums. Her book receives a spate of one-star reviews. Editorial work dries up. The threats in his emails escalate. It become harder and harder for her to retreat to a place of safety.</p>
<p>The novel contains long passages from the fantasy novel that Ella is editing, and I become caught up in that story, just as she does. When the fantasy&#8217;s plot takes a wrong turn and she tries to persuade the author to rewrite, Newland reveals that characters from the fantasy also appear in her Lethal Inheritance series and their fate depends on Ella&#8217;s being able to change the fictional author&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the metafictional aspect of Worlds Within Worlds. Newland includes a foreword emphasizing that she is NOT Ella. She doesn&#8217;t need to explain, at least not to me.</p>
<p>The novel has some weaknesses. Long passages describe the process of meditation. I found them interesting (although a bit didactic at times), but some readers may feel they slow the story. The plot culminates in a revelation that I figure out very early, but Newland covers her foreshadowing enough to make me wonder if I&#8217;m wrong.</p>
<p>Writers will appreciate Worlds Within Worlds for its exploration of the creative process. Intelligent readers will enjoy the memorable characters, the suspense, and the intricacies of Ella&#8217;s interlocking worlds.</p>

<p><em>Off the Beaten Track</em> is a memoir of long time travel writer Frank Kusy, author of the AIA Seal of Excellence winner <em>Rupee Millionaire</em>. Kusy’s experience as a writer shows in the fluid, vibrant prose he uses to describe his travels in Asia in the seventies. This is an engaging story full of anecdotes that have you smiling and shaking your head at the antics of the young Kusy.</p>
<p>The difficulty in memoir writing is to find a thread that unifies the story in the way that the plot does in fiction. Generally, real life isn’t as dramatic as fiction, and in unskilled hands, it’s easy to lose a reader if the account of a person’s life wanders aimlessly. This would be particularly easy to do in a travel memoir, but Kusy has worked skilfully with his material and used the thread of his efforts to both secure and avoid getting a wife in the same way that a fiction writer would use a plot. Though the various anecdotes are interesting in themselves, without this emphasis, they would not provide such a satisfying whole. We want to read to the end to see how young Frank’s bumbling efforts at romance turn out. Frank is an endearing character and his perspective on the world and efforts to live as a Buddhist add another layer of interest to the memoir.</p>
<p>The other theme, as the title suggests, is his desire to get off the beaten track, and the events that thwart his attempts to really experience Asia without a whiff of tourists provide further interest beyond a mere account of his travels. Though not as dramatic as Rupee Millionaires, it’s still a great read, especially for anyone interested in travel in Asia. Highly recommended.</p>
<p>The editing is excellent. My only misgiving was that I would have liked the author to have gone more deeply into some aspects of his journey; for example, the ceremony when the Joju Gohonzon was enshrined in the main temple in Jakarta. No doubt the author has his reasons for staying clear of it, but I felt it was a missed opportunity to go deeper into the culture.</p>
<p>All up Kusy is a very talented memoir writer and this book should be enjoyed by a wide variety of people.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Sicilian Defence is a collection of short stories based on characters who live in or around Sicily. The stories are varied in topic, but all written in a very literary style.  Each story is independent of the others, making this an easy book to pick up, read for a bit and feel satisfied that you have read a good story.</p>
<p>The voice is decidedly European, but interesting. The observations and characters are so real, so true to life that they’re unsettling. The endings are enigmatic but they stay with the reader in their possibilities. I am enthralled by these stories. They are of a style and quality that should do the same for many readers in many parts of the world. Overall, this is a well written collection with varied stories. However, some may find the pace of the stories a little too slow.</p>

<p>Both emerging and established writers from Europe, the USA, Australia and New Zealand present a peek into the spectacular moments everyday life holds, but with a twist.</p>
<p>The collection opens with a bang with a story by Tahlia Newland. Intriguing to the last paragraph, I was surprised to find it was an excerpt from her newest project. It sits perfectly as a short story and a wonderful teaser into what looks to be an exciting premise.</p>
<p>Each story has an incredible depth and texture to them, that, although is specific to its own style, melds beautifully as a collection. The human condition is explored where the reader is challenged to reassess their perspectives on stereotypes and events. Post apocalyptic tales sit comfortably with personalised stories like fragmented memories; separate, but with a golden thread holding them together. Heart-wrenching, whimsical, tear-jerking and lighthearted there is a story to suit all moods and readers tastes.</p>
<p>It is difficult to chose a favourite story, with a wrestling loving gran meeting her idol, to emotional trials of marriages breaking apart or forming, futuristic zombies and maids from a gentler time.</p>
<p>Authors are recognised in their own right with multiple honours and prizes and although the anthology is an eclectic mixture of genre, reading one after the other only highlights the complexity and intrigue each story brings.</p>
<p>A great book to stash into someones Christmas stocking for some fireside holiday reading, Awesome Allshorts is set to be a winner in your readers life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/delirium-review-an-ambitious-book/"><img width="890" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Delerium-890x400.jpg" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="Delerium" /></a><p><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Delerium.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-10397 aligncenter" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Delerium-200x300.jpg" alt="Delerium" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>There are a lot of voices to listen to in <em>Delirium</em>, and they’re all talking about one thing: a lost manuscript.</p>
<p>The search begins with the source, the poet Arthur Rimbaud, the manuscript’s author. We hear first the voices of Rimbaud, his lover Paul Verlaine, and Verlaine’s wife, Mathilde, giving us a glimpse of the world as it was then, in the late 19th century. Other voices add to the story as we follow the manuscript through the 20th century and into the 21st.</p>
<p>Knitting the story together is the central narrative of Andrea Mann, who, in 2004, goes in search of Rimbaud’s lost poem, <em>La Chasse Spirituelle</em>. Andrea’s meeting with a young man at Rimbaud’s grave starts her on a journey that may or may not connect her with a manuscript that, if genuine, would be worth a great deal of money. It’s not the money, though, that intrigues Andrea. We sense that the lost poem represents something else.</p>
<p>The intertwining threads of the history of the manuscript—caught up with its various custodians in the senseless tragedy of World War I, the cruel barbarity of World War II, and the lives, hopes, and dreams of ordinary people—I found fascinating. Andrea Mann’s story I found less so. Perhaps because part of her search involves knowing, or not knowing, what is real and what is not, I was never sure what was real and what was not. While that may have been a conscious choice by the author, it kept me too cautious, unwilling to enter fully into Andrea’s story. As in real life, if I believe I’m being misled, I will stay a bit removed from a situation. That remove also made me too critical—even judgmental—of Andrea. I never really got a sense of who she was; I only saw her jerked around by the manipulations of others.</p>
<p><em>Delirium</em> is an ambitious book. I believe the author did not quite achieve her ambition in telling Andrea’s story, but it was a worthy attempt. I’m still mulling over many of the issues she raised and questions she never answered fully. And I’ve also started reading fin de siecle French poetry.</p>
<p>I received this free of charge in return for an honest review on behalf of the Awesome Indies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/worlds-within-worlds-review-a-very-topical-book/"><img width="890" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB-890x400.jpg" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="Worlds_Final-WEB" /></a><p><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-10620 aligncenter" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB-198x300.jpg" alt="Worlds_Final-WEB" width="198" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>This is a very topical book, a very well written one too. Thirty something Ella Smith lives in a remote log cabin in the Australian bush, cut off from most of humanity but connected through her mind and imagination (and her internet) to a multitude of worlds: at times she is a writer/editor in the real world, at others she is a wise old Yogi in the prelude to the 1959 Chinese invasion of Tibet, or Kelee, the fictional warrior princess with whom she comes to identify strongly through the book she is editing. Not to mention her alter ego as Electra, an ‘after dark’ dancer in a local strip joint. The topicality of the book comes when Ella responds to a request of an ‘honest’ review from an arrogant (and unbalanced) author on his new novel and gives him just that… a two-star review on a social media website (Amazon) which he deeply resents. At this point, we enter Stephen King territory – the demented author Dita shouting “Take it down!” much as the main protagonist of King’s ‘Thinner’ shouts ‘Take it off!’ to the gypsy who has laid a curse him. When she doesn’t, the author turns cyber troll and begins invading her virtual world with increasingly nasty abuse and threats, along with one-star reviewing her own recently published book. As the bullying author penetrates even her dream world (he’s a dark, human shaped blob in a hoodie!) her other identities as Kelee, Electra and the Yogi also run into crisis, and she struggles, through her Buddhist practice, to elevate her mind above the worldly concern of being unliked by 20 Facebook friends overnight. ‘Sometimes it’s hard being a Buddhist,’ she observes when not just one but two stalkers get on her case – the fight is on, in her own mind, to see all obstacles as opportunities, to see Dita, The Creep and even the evil Beak as fuel to fire her own journey to enlightenment. This is riveting stuff, part magical realism dreamscape, part taut psychological thriller, and I was literally on the edge of my seat when the final twist – and what a twist it is – came around. Phew, what a ride!<br />
I received a copy of this book in exchange for an ‘honest’ review of my own. Well done, Ms Newland, I can honestly say this is the best book have read this year.<br />
Make sure it goes on your list of great new books to read.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/short-story-the-senior-school-days-of-arthur-callum-1915-1917-part-3/"><img width="688" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Arthur-callum-688x400.png" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="Picture of Arthur Callum and his sister, Winnifred, circa 1905" /></a><p>We had grand field days with the O.T.C. Two platoons would be marched some few miles away to protect, say, a farm. The other two platoons would attack in an attempt to “take the objective”. We were provided with a dozen rounds of “blank” ammunition. We smaller boys realised and seized the opportunity this provided. Skilfully, we plugged the top of our barrels with mud. Then at the appropriate moment, when espying a sergeant, we took careful aim and fired! The usual result was “six of the best!” Fair enough.</p>
<p>Of course we worked too. The school curriculum was very comprehensive for those far off days based as it was on “Maths”, Geography, History, Divinity, French and Latin. I was usually “top” in Maths- thanks to my sister who, years before, had managed to explain and get into my rather thick head, the intricacies of simple fractions. She managed this with apples and a knife, cutting them into physical sections. Knowledge, my Prep School masters had tried to instil by screaming at me. (‘Prep’, officially preparatory, schools are the primer institutions for the public schools. Both of these are fee paying schools independent of the State school system). As it happened Maths was the subject taught by my later Housemaster, which many of us were so anxious to please. One is encouraged to work harder for fine and honourable men.</p>
<p>One day he was taking Maths and did a rather complicated sum on the blackboard, explaining a problem previously set for us. “Has anyone got this correct?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir,” answered a boy, “I have”. His paper was examined revealing that he had cheated by altering a figure.</p>
<p>“Cheating?” said my Housemaster.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir.”</p>
<p>Without a word more, the ‘Old Bird’, as we affectionately called our Housemaster, left the classroom and, a few minutes later returned with his ‘bargepole’, his cane, and there and then gave the offender the inevitable ‘six’. Some two weeks later, much the same thing happened. The Old Bird set a problem; we did it as best we could. He in turn did it on the blackboard. His final figure differed from mine. I hastily altered my figure. “Has a boy obtained this result?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir.” I said. Then our teacher noticed he had made an error, then altering his total, which, to my consternation agreed with my original result. He looked at my paper.</p>
<p>“Cheating?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir.” He did not retire to get his bargepole but carried on with the lesson. I thought, being in his house, he would call me to his study at evening prep. The evening came, I was not called. The next day I passed him in the Cloisters, just before breakfast time. He ignored me completely. I was totally ignored for the whole day and so went to his study in the evening and knocked on his door. “Come in”, said his sing-song voice. I entered. “Get out”, he said. I don’t think I have ever felt so low in all of my subsequent life. Suffice it to say that I could stand it no longer, so I went to his study again. I was bid to enter. “What do you want?” he said.</p>
<p>“ Sir, you caught me cheating two days ago and I cannot stand being ignored.” He realised I was very upset.</p>
<p>“You know”, he said, “you’ve no need to cheat, but I think I know why you did. Now you want me to give you six and thus pay your debt don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not going to. Instead I want you to promise never to cheat again- now shake hands.” He gave me a chocolate. I never did cheat from that moment. How he knew our characters. I now began to understand what Public School education was all about.</p>
<p>I didn’t shine at games, although I was in the School Shooting VIII, pretty good at swimming, and quite useful with the ‘gloves’. Now, during our ‘long runs’ I was getting a severe searing pain in my lower abdomen- possibly the start of an appendicitis which blew up years later, bursting and leading to serious complications that were to last me, I can now be certain, for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Now came winter term of 1917. It was three weeks before ‘Break-up’ for Christmas. One Sunday the Head came into Hall and called for me to attend his study immediately. I naturally wondered what I had done. When I arrived the Head said to me, “Sit down, my boy, have a chocolate”. I sensed what was coming then, for my dear father had been ill for some time. “I want you to go to your dorm and pack, you’re father isn’t very well and has asked that I send you home.” He put his hand on my shoulder- that was enough. I burst into tears.</p>
<p>“Is he . . .” I asked.</p>
<p>“No no,” said the Head, “but he is very ill. A car will be ready for you in an hour”. Then, after a pause he added, ”God be with you.” I returned to pack- all my dormitory friends waiting to help me. My dear Housemaster came up and I was escorted to the Cloisters where the school car, an old “T” Ford, was waiting for me. I left my school, looking through the rear window of that car, to see the Old Bird and my friends waving me away. I was very sad at this moment, but deeply grateful for their kindnesses.</p>
<p>My dear father died some four weeks later.</p>
<p>The Head wrote what I can describe as a wonderful letter to my mother, offering a school exhibition in my favour to help with the school fees. But, alas, family circumstances did not permit acceptance.</p>
<p>How grateful I am for my time at the School, to my Head and Housemaster- to all my alma mater. They were happy, happy days. Tough though life in boarding schools was in those days they only reflected tough life in general. Occasional upset aside, I really was extremely happy there and immensely respected most of my then betters. So how should this essay end?</p>
<p>How about, Arthur Callum lived happy school days, whilst those born just before him died on the Somme.</p>

<p><em>(Found in my mother&#8217;s bottom draw. The author, my grandmother&#8217;s brother, lived long enough to help me grow up. I have lightly edited the story, fully respecting his words. The understatement of difficulty common to his now passed generation shines through, a hundred years from the depicted events and I guess at least fifty since the writing. This story is first published here.</em></p>

<p><em>‘The barrier between the worlds shatters like the window. The beast is loose. My nightmare has become real. The guy has totally lost it. If he finds us here, we could die. No, I don’t doubt it; we will die.’</em></p>
<p>Author and editor Prunella Smith inhabits a multilayered reality. Physically, she lives in the Australian bush with her crazy cat Merlin. In her work world, she edits the love story of Kelee, a Magan Lord’s daughter, and in the cyber-world of social media, she’s subjected to slanderous attacks by a disgruntled author. To complicate matters further she sees things through the eyes of a Tibetan Yogi, has strange dreams and relives old memories.</p>
<p>Separate worlds, interconnected and complementary, but can they help when Prunella becomes victim to a real life stalker and her sanity is threatened?</p>
<p><em>Worlds Within Worlds</em> has a unique perspective on the nature of creativity. Its touch is light, its humour distinctive but it reaches deep into the nature of human experience.</p>
<h2>What readers are saying.</h2>
<p>“This is riveting stuff, part magical realism dreamscape, part taut psychological thriller, and I was literally on the edge of my seat when the final twist—and what a twist it is—came around. Phew, what a ride! I can honestly say it is the best book I have read this year.” Frank Kusy, author of Rupee Millionaires.</p>
<p>“Worlds Within Worlds tackles the problem of identity in the age of technological anonymity. Ella Smith is an independent author and editor whose online life crashes into reality with disturbing implications. The book questions how much of one&#8217;s true self can &#8211; and should &#8211; be broadcast to the world.</p>
<p>This book will make you think. Considering the deluge of new works streaming from authors these days, that may be the highest praise a novel can receive.” Amy Spahn, editor.</p>
<p>“An appealing novel about a woman who suffers from online stalking after writing a book review. It’s a well-paced story and is a fascinating insight into the mind of someone using meditative techniques to deal with stress.” Kevin Berry, Awesome Indies reviews.</p>
<p>Make sure it goes on your list of great new books to read.</p>
