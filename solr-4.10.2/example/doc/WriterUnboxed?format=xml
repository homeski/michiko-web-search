<p><strong>5 Writing Lessons from a Vocal Coach</strong></p>
<p>During the years I was first learning fiction craft, my son was studying to be a classical vocalist. Since I came to my writing through dance I was already attuned to a multi-arts perspective, so as I sat in on years of his lessons—no doubt looking to his teachers like I was hard at work on a novel—I scribbled notes that allowed me to see my writing anew. Here I share some of the comments overheard from his vocal coaches and my favorite writing takeaways.</p>
<ol>
<li><em> Singing is powered by the breath—by an inspiration—but don’t give it all away. Take a deep breath and try to hold it in as long as possible while still using it to power the voice. Singing is a little bit “yes,” a little bit “no.”</em></li>
</ol>
<p>At the time I first heard this I was trying to wow the reader by cramming too many great ideas into the opening of my practice novel. This quote suggested I feed out my story with greater patience, keeping some in reserve. Your reader isn’t looking to understand your whole story in its opening pages. She only wants to gain orientation to the story world and its main character while discovering a story question on which to hang her curiosity. Many backstory scenes, reversals, and emotional turning points are better saved until your reader knows your protagonist better.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote"><p>I come to writing from a multi-arts perspective and appreciate the way that specifics from one creative endeavor can spark new awarenesses within another.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>Added fun: The musicality in this quote is a wonderful example of how to use sentence structure to support meaning. The quick breaths built into the first sentence, the deeper breath needed to get through the second, and the push and pull of the third all help underscore the coach’s point.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><em> When taking a breath, you are not really thinking about taking in air, but expanding the ribcage and dropping the diaphragm to create a vacuum that the air will fill.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>This continues a useful metaphor about raising story questions. A question is like a vacuum that pulls the reader in. So rather than stuffing your story with events that may or may not add up to a cohesive whole, think about creating the questions that your story will fill. Keep raising questions, keep drawing the reader in. When all the questions are answered <span id="more-34581"></span><a href="http://writerunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Full-ArtofFalling-cover.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-34585 size-medium" src="http://writerunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Full-ArtofFalling-cover-200x300.jpg" alt="Full ArtofFalling cover" width="200" height="300" /></a>the story is over, just as when we are done breathing, our lives come to their end.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><em> You are trying too hard on the high notes. Maybe that’s because you haven’t yet found your true voice. You have a voice that’s all your own—when you get to the high notes, trust that it will be there.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Your reader lives for the turning points that create the emotional peaks of your story. But you don’t want her to have to sift through overwrought emotional language, flowery description, or long-winded exposition to find them. If you’ve let your reader in on your character’s motivations, desires, and goals as you powered up your story, and used plot to force change, trust that your reader is right there with you. Indeed she has anticipated this moment of character change. Once you have delivered her to it, allow her to watch the drama unfold without you screaming in her ear.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><em> Arching the soft palate is a technique that keeps the air from escaping through the nose while singing. But you don’t want to arch it so high that you paralyze the tongue, as when yawning.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I hear this as a caution about stilted prose. Reach too far toward lofty language and you too will paralyze your reader and put him right to sleep.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><em> People love baritones because of all the voices, it is the closest to the speaking voice.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>My son is a baritone, so I thought the thrill of his voice was born of my love. But this is a powerful reminder of the way we delight in voice. After many virtual friends here met in person at the Writer UnBoxed UnConference last month, one of them wrote on the UnCon feed, “Now I can read all of your comments and hear them in your voice.” Our voices are precious. They are what we know of the sound of love. The closer to human voice you can come in your prose, the closer your reader will lean in to listen.</p>
<p><strong>Use this post is an exercise in creative listening. Do these passages speak to you differently? If so—or if you’ve learned important insights about writing from other art forms—I’d love to hear from you in the comments.</strong></p>

<p>Today&#8217;s guest is aspiring novelist Lancelot Schaubert. Lance has sold work to markets like McSweeney&#8217;s, Poker Pro, Scars, Encounter, Brink, and many others. He wrote, produced, and directed <a href="http://lanceschaubert.org/books-and-stories/books/cold-brewed/" target="_blank">Cold Brewed</a> which reinvented the photonovel. Currently, he&#8217;s finishing his first novel in between large batches of various soups (<i>today&#8217;s soup, for the curious among us, is white chili</i>).</p>
<p>His essay for WU, which draws comparisons between conflict in novels and in the roll-playing game Dungeons and Dragons, will speak to your &#8220;inner geek.&#8221; (Don&#8217;t pretend you don&#8217;t have one.) And if you really are questioning <em>why D&amp;D? </em>Consider this: D&amp;D is all about story and conflict.</p>
<p>You can learn more about Lance at <a href="http://lanceschaubert.org/" target="_blank">lanceschaubert.org</a> and on <a href="https://twitter.com/lanceschaubert">Twitter</a>, or <a href="http://lanceschaubert.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=1aa567383777d689c3146da63&amp;id=8ca9a20682" target="_blank">join the guild of renegade imaginations receiving his updates</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What Dungeons and Dragons Taught Me About Story Conflict</strong></p>
<p>Confession: I spent way too much money on comic books, D&amp;D dice, and video games in high school. Lucky for me, some of it came in handy for my career as a writer. Actually <em>most</em> of it came in handy, but this isn’t an apologetic for geek stores. It’s an article about conflict.</p>
<p>And conflict is strange. Really strange.</p>
<p>We literary types use the word “conflict” like business people use “synergy” and churchy people use “missional” and politicians use “foreign policy.” We use it so often, we have almost no freaking clue what it means anymore. I know I didn’t at first.</p>
<p>The first time someone told me, “Your story needs more conflict,” I wrote a battle scene into a non-battle story. Think: Matrix-meets-Sleepless-in-Seattle. Frustrated, they tried again to explain what they meant. I didn’t get it.</p>
<p>It’s because <em>conflict</em> has become our nonsensical buzzword. And we’re actually kind of proud of it, even if we’re clueless as to its true meaning. You might think it would be good to try another word, but we’re stuck with the word “conflict.” <em>D</em><em>ispute</em> limits the topic to arguments. <em>Sexual tension</em> only works for erotica and certain scenes of romance. <em>Fight</em> sounds broader but still only includes interpersonal conflict and some forms of external conflict.<em> Negotiation</em> keeps us in the verbal and economic spheres but limits us where violence, pacifism, and forces of nature are concerned. <em>Voyage</em> takes care of the nature part, but limits us concerning still, small voices.</p>
<p>We’re stuck with the word, so I figured I might as well get to know it.</p>
<p>Robert McKee’s section on conflict in STORY helped me a bit:</p>
<p><em>Conflict is to storytelling what sound is to music… The music of story is conflict…. Writers who cannot grasp the truth of our transitor</em><em>y existence, who have been mislead by the counterfeit comforts of the modern world, who believe that life is easy once you know how to play the game, give conflict a false inflection. Their [stories] fail for one of two reasons: <strong>either a glut of meaninglessness and absurdly violent conflict, or a vacancy of meaningful and honestly expressed conflict</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>I started to understand and then I remembered how conflicting dice rolls work in D&amp;D. Now if you’re a women’s lit writer, hang with me – this will apply to you too, I promise.</p>
<p>But first, let’s get one thing out of the way: I’m not talking about the recent versions of D&amp;D the new kids play. I’m talking about version 3.5 or earlier. In the early versions of the game, you create character sheets that are <em>pages</em> long. Everyone has a base set of abilities like “strength” and “wisdom” and then adds those bonuses to various skills. If you’ve ever played any of the Elder Scrolls games (or any fantasy game at all, really), you understand how this works.</p>
<p>How do these things affect a character? Let&#8217;s consider Noah from <em>The</em> Notebook.</p>
<p>Noah<em> </em>had a base ability of charisma that was off the charts but his wisdom was… well, let’s just say that wisdom didn’t really come into play when he decided to jump on the outside of that Ferris Wheel cart. Regardless of genre, characters have basic abilities. And then skills. Noah wasn’t wise, but he <em>did</em> have a knack for poetry because that’s where he invested his time. That often made up for his foolishness.</p>
<p>If you want to do something in D&amp;D – speak, discover, flirt – you add three numbers: <strong>ability, skill, roll.</strong><span id="more-34336"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_34341" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lydiashiningbrightly/3423988153/in/photolist-6dyQov-fruVXa-7DY41y-94N7SJ-6dyR18-7SEHvq-7Aheg3-7SBpGe-5XPTMj-3dzZLX-Bg4QT-f68djE-6crAnN-fsiePk-58WjWV-9Xziy-9Xzk9-Bg4Kc-Bg44H-5XPZ9f-8iwGpq-iDsEsB-Bg4Mh-7W5A9f-8QJ8af-6imNpi-9Xz5D-9Xzcv-9Xz2N-9XzdZ-9Xzem-9Xzm1-9Xzmz-9Xzmo-9Xzij-9XzcL-9XzdM-9Xzgy-9Xz6H-9Xz6e-9XzkC-9XziK-9Xzna-9Xz9F-9XzfT-9Xz5f-9XziT-9Xz91-9Xzj8-9Xzi6"><img class="size-medium wp-image-34341" src="http://writerunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Lance2-300x225.jpg" alt="photo by Lydia" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo by Lydia</p></div>
<p><strong>The first is an ability </strong>like “strength” or “intelligence,” a measurable potential like IQ or EQ. My character might be an idiot savant and have +3 intelligence but lives in the body of an eight-year-old boy and so has -3 strength. His abilities work like the bones of his character.</p>
<p><strong>To ability, we add skill.</strong> Every time your character gains experience in D&amp;D, she gets an allotted amount of skill points to invest. She might have added no skill points to “grappling” but five to “knowledge: history.” These skills come into play on an action-by-action basis. We might call these “quirks” or “talents” or even “vocation” in a story, like Noah’s knack for poetry.</p>
<p><strong>Finally for a given task we add the die roll</strong>. Chance factors into stories by way of the author – this is the unknown, the relative efficaciousness of any given action, the question <em>did the action work?</em></p>
<p>In D&amp;D, you roll for everything. Say another character goes to grapple your character and you’re this eight-year-old boy. They’re the hulking weight-lifting champion of the world. They have +3 strength, you have -3 strength. They’ve invested 3 points in grappling, you’ve invested 0.</p>
<p>Then they roll a 19, you roll a 19.</p>
<p>The final score?</p>
<p>Them: 25; You: 16.</p>
<p>They’ve got you tight in a bear hug and they’re not letting go. You loose that conflict.</p>
<p>Make sense?</p>
<p>Everything you do in the game pits one character’s roll against another character’s roll. If you want to pick a lock, you pit the lock difficulty (25) against your lock-picking ability (1 dexterity + 2 lock picking + 19 roll = 22 fail). Remember Marv in <em>Home Alone?</em> That was a fail at lock picking.</p>
<p>If you want to stay outside during a terrible weather storm you pit the danger of the lightning (20) against your survival skills (2 wisdom + 3 Survival + 15 roll = 20 success… just barely). Remember Katniss in the climax of <em>Catching Fire</em>? That was a skin-of-her-teeth success at surviving a lightning strike.</p>
<p>If you want to persuade a person to let you see a secret document (30), then you’ll use skills you’ve invested in diplomacy (-2 charisma + 7 diplomacy + 17 roll = 25 fail, but try again later). Remember Snape and the Marauder’s Map in <em>Harry Potter</em>? That was a fail at diplomacy and, later, at deciphering the map.</p>
<p>If someone lies to you (20) all you have to do is sense their motives (3 intelligence + 6 sense motive + 12 roll = 21 success like Matt Damon does to Eddie KGB in <em>Rounders</em>) to call their bluff. Works good for poker, eh?</p>
<p>If someone tries to flirt with you (20 for bluff) you can roll to sense their motives (24) and refuse to acknowledge their advances just like Katherina in the beginning of <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em>.</p>
<p>If you fail the roll, though, you might end up like Katherina at the end of <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em>.</p>
<p>In the old Dungeons and Dragons, you roll for everything. You roll to jump over a chasm. You roll to inspire troops. You roll to research various hard, harder, and hardest concepts. You roll to decipher code. You roll to see if your arrow hit the dragon (probably not) or if it missed and hit instead one of the forty guards behind the dragon (probably so). You roll to see if your beer spills down your beard. You roll to find hidden paths. You roll to sneak past watching eyes, make sexual advances, cure cancer, fight demons, uncover mysteries, and wonder at the fate of humanity.</p>
<p>You rolled to see if you got to the bathroom in time. One time, my friend Andy’s character rolled a critical fail on peeing on a dead body. The guy running the game said, “You piss your pants.”</p>
<p>Which was hilarious.</p>
<p>Until we tried to sneak up on these monsters with heightened senses of smell. They smelled the urine and we lost. Terribly. They call it a “party wipe” in DnD because <em>everyone</em> gets murdered by the bad guys. We did, however, learn how to mask smells on that campaign and that came in handy later. Good characters always learn from their mistakes and that’s why we tell one another stories.</p>
<p>When an object or character stands against you in DnD, it rolls a conflicting die (if it’s animate) or starts out with a default number for difficulty (if it’s inanimate). Highest number wins.</p>
<p>That’s goals in conflict: winner moves forward and loser tries to find a new way to struggle through.</p>
<p>Conflicting rolls cover external, interpersonal and internal conflict. Does this cover <em>everything</em> that happens in a given DnD story? Well no, there are Non-Playable Characters in the game that tell you what’s going on. There are also clues and trails and alternate story lines, all of which you can choose to engage or ignore.</p>
<p>However, character action moves the story along. The game wouldn’t be half so addicting if you could just waltz into a dungeon, fill your pockets with treasure, and walk out. Conflict makes the game and moves the story. You could say the conflict — the goals in active opposition that result in a winner and a loser — <em>is</em> the story.</p>
<p>Or, if you prefer, when you find yourself stuck in the middle of writing a screenplay or a book, ask yourself: are there any obstacles?</p>
<p>If not, what can I add?</p>
<p>If so, what’s the conflicting roll and how <em>good</em> is my character at overcoming these sort of things? If they’re terrible, can they get around it somehow?</p>
<p>In DnD you can (1) pick a building’s lock or break the lock or (2) break down the door the lock’s on or (3) try sneaking in through a window or (4) seduce the owner until they open it or (5) bribe someone else to open it or (6) cast a spell to make you walk through it or (7) employ any number of other options to get inside or…</p>
<p>There’s never one way. There are infinite paths.</p>
<p>Interesting stories create that very same environment:</p>
<p>If your main character’s a high school science teacher burdened with the debt of a cancer diagnosis, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad">he can’t cure cancer, but can he make meth</a>?</p>
<p>If he’s a billionaire playboy philanthropist who hates companies that profiteer off of war, he can’t stop profiteering, but<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man"> can he use a green-energy arc reactor to make a formidable threat to said companies</a>?</p>
<p>If she’s an FBI agent worried about the lives of Ms. America contestants, she can’t go undercover as the prettiest, but <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212346/">can she get in as the most congenial</a>?</p>
<p>Conflicting rolls show us back doors into and out of sticky situations and help us understand that awful literary buzzword: conflict.</p>
<p>Assess the difficulty of every given situation.</p>
<p>Then find a clever way around <em>within the skillset of your character.</em></p>
<p>That’s a story.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts to share? The floor is yours.</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Now for the main course.</strong></em></p>
<p>Frosting as I’m going to use it here doesn’t refer to anything involving confectioner’s sugar, however it’s just as important to an author interested in presentation and consumption as it is to a baker. Frosting isn’t anything central to your story; it will never appear in an outline. Frosting refers to things like chapter titles, poignant lines, funny quips, clever innuendo, even the arrangement of scenes in some cases. With this analogy, the cake itself is your core story—the plot, the characters, the voice.</p>
<p>If you’re like most people, you like frosting—as an eater and a reader—but as a writer we must be careful of it. Writing a draft that’s too pretty, too perfected with its minutiae, can make it painfully difficult later to edit. You may be at risk for this problem if you often find yourself charmed with details of your own writing, because when it’s time to make necessary edits, you may unconsciously (or even consciously) warp your scenes in order to keep those sculpted sugar-flower words and colorful arrangements. “But they’re sooo sweet, sooo pretty,” you may whine to yourself, struggling to have your cake and frosting too.</p>
<p>Truth is, you should never make a decision about a scene based on frosting; story details cannot hold sway over the story itself when it’s time to edit. Sometimes it works out and you may find a way to keep your favorite bits in a way that doesn’t seem forced, but other times you will have to pick up your editorial knife and scrape your artistic work away completely.</p>
<p>Your best bet? Know when to frost a scene to prevent the painful “unfrosting” process. Here’s how:<span id="more-34601"></span></p>
<p>• <strong>Bake your cake.</strong> When you’re in draft mode, resist thinking about finishing touches, including anything that has you reaching for the thesaurus. As one of my critique buddies advises, write a quick-and-dirty first draft to be sure the story itself is working before you worry about prettying it up. Just bake your cake.</p>
<p>• <strong>Be sure it&#8217;s truly cooked.</strong> Don’t give in to the urge to over-edit scenes until the entire first draft of the entire manuscript is complete. Oh, this can be so hard, I know, but would you ever start frosting the cooked edges of a cake before the whole is baked? It just doesn’t make sense to start perfecting a part before the whole is before you.</p>
<p>• <strong>Cool your cake.</strong> Give your cake time to “cool” after the first draft of your WIP is completed, and don&#8217;t sit and watch it cool either. Time away from your story is critical, because fresh eyes may see where improvements should be made to the structure before you continue. Sometimes the unthinkable happens and a cake collapses after it’s removed from the oven; never frost a collapsed cake.</p>
<p>• <strong>Brush off loose crumbs.</strong> Take one more nit-picking look at your work, with a sharp eye on pacing, setting and scene arrangement, before thinking about the little extras.</p>
<p>• <strong>Frost evenly and with care.</strong> Make sure the bulk of what your reader will “taste” when they consume your story is your story. Don’t put undue emphasis on the clever additions.</p>
<p>• <strong>Be creative.</strong> Almost anyone can frost a cake. What can you do to make your extras distinctive and interesting?</p>
<p>Even with your best efforts, you may occasionally have to sacrifice favorite scenes, lines, etc… for the good of your story. In his book <em>James A. Michener’s Writer’s Handbook</em>, Michener said,</p>
<blockquote><p>I love the rich embellishment of a statement, the marshaling of arcane data, the retelling of illustrative incident, and the hammering down of the point I seek to make.</p></blockquote>
<p>He describes a notation from his editor about a piece of writing, something I think Michener would admit was frosting: a clever insertion into one of his manuscripts about Gene Lockhart and his daughter June. The fact that his editor asked Michener to cut it was described as</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;the most difficult annotation of all.</p></blockquote>
<p>No one, not even the most successful authors, wants to scrape frosting, but Michener gets it, acknowledging both the reasoning behind the passage and his editor’s valid point.</p>
<blockquote><p>In this instance I wanted to refer to that delightful actor Gene Lockhart because I had recently acted on an informal stage in Belgium with his daughter, June. The passage could be cut. Sorry, June.</p></blockquote>
<p>When it happens, take a moment to soliloquize if you need to, then pick up your editorial knife. Sugar happens. Sugar carnage must also happen.</p>

Instead I’m flailing around the night before my post is due, trying to string together something meaningful. I thought of asking Harry to write this for me, as he’s provided a WU post before on the vexed topic of deadlines, and how the life of a writer’s dog becomes less comfortable the closer they get. But for reasons given below, Harry isn’t up to the job right now.</p>
<p>My manuscript, a historical fantasy/mystery, is due for submission in January.  It&#8217;s progressing well but I have a sizeable percentage of it still to write, and I’m not speedy. Usually I have time to finish the novel, set it aside for a while, then polish further and submit before the deadline. This time around, there’s a lot left to write and just over a month remaining.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m an experienced pro. And I’ll get it done. But I’m not happy about my poor time management on this particular novel. I need to learn from the experience and make sure I don’t let it happen again. Some things I can avoid next time; some, sadly, I will need to build into future plans.</p>
<p>Side projects: When I’m asked to contribute a piece to an anthology, or to present a workshop or attend a writers’ event, I find it hard to say no. This year I wrote a short story for an anthology about strong women in history; it was a project I was thrilled and excited to be part of. My story about Hildegard of Bingen was only 5000 words, but it took a long time to craft – distilling Hildegard’s extraordinary life into so few words was a challenge, and I wrote several versions before I felt I’d got it right. I also presented some talks and workshops, though I managed to say no to a couple, knowing how much preparation I generally need to do.</p>
<p>Learning: next year, say no more often. Only take on the projects you can’t bear to let pass by.</p>
<p>Work-related travel and appearances: <span id="more-34565"></span>I attended the Historical Novelists’ Conference in London earlier in the year, and I’ve just returned from a crazy ten days away, during which I was a guest at the Supanova Pop Culture Expo, two days in Adelaide one weekend, three days in Brisbane the following weekend. The picture shows me signing stock for the expo bookseller. Supanova is a wonderful, fun event celebrating all things science fiction and fantasy, and I always enjoy it. It’s loud, bright, busy and generally full-on. The authors chat to fans and sign books all day, except when speaking on discussion panels. Very little writing got done. Travel also gobbled up time. Australia is a big country: Brisbane to Perth, where I live, is a five hour flight. I head off to Sydney on Friday for a signing and a book launch.</p>
<p>Learning: Use technology better so you can edit on the plane without elbowing your neighbours. Don’t schedule major travel for the last two months before your deadline. Choose your events with care. Supanova is excellent as it provides lots of interaction with readers. Those readers are an author&#8217;s lifeblood. Don&#8217;t lose sight of them.</p>
<p>Family: In between those two Supanova weekends I visited the part of my family that lives in an off-the-grid alternative community. That meant I got to meet my new granddaughter, just two weeks old. This was as different from Supanova as it could possibly be. I squeezed in a bit of writing. Not a lot. Other family commitments are ongoing, and that is as it should be. Family overrules all other considerations.</p>
<p>Dogs: I am a foster carer for an animal rescue group, and as well as the dogs that spend time with me while awaiting adoption, I have some permanent residents, several of whom have health issues. This year both my precious Harry and old lady Amy have developed serious medical conditions that require ongoing intensive management. My little tribe is an absolute delight, even though its members sometimes break my heart. It’s looking as if the year ahead will be especially challenging.</p>
<p>Learning: No additional dogs, for now at least. Write as fast as you can to keep up with the vet bills! Harry says, don&#8217;t forget walkies. Cuddles. Treats. Naps.</p>
<p>The main lesson learned is that I need to get started on the next novel pretty much straight after I finish the current one, and perhaps work to a daily or weekly word count from the first, rather than only when things get pressured. From the comfortable perspective of, say, March, it’s all too easy to view next January’s deadline as too far away to worry about. Then, as soon as you relax, three or four months have slipped by, some personal crisis comes up, and you’re in real trouble. I plan to keep reminding myself of this wisdom. Meanwhile, I plan not only to get the ms finished on time, but also to do it well.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your approach to time management as a writer? What strategies do you put in place to meet deadlines? How do you balance the need to finish against the personal cost?</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><p><a href="http://writerunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Mass-1024x698.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-34555" src="http://writerunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Mass-1024x698-525x357.jpg" alt="Mass-1024x698" width="500" height="341" /></a>Have you ever grown impatient with a novel?  Have you ever restlessly flipped ahead wishing that something would <em>happen?</em>  Of course.  It’s a common feeling.  Put politely, you feel frustrated.  Put plainly, you’re bored.</p>
<p>Perhaps your own current manuscript has also had you feeling, at times, impatient.  Have you struggled to find a way to make things <em>happen?</em>  Do you sense that the inner state of your main character is significant, but that it isn’t turning into events dramatic enough?  Do you secretly worry that your beautiful words won’t be enough to captivate your readers for four hundred pages?</p>
<p>If you answered yes then I have bad news for you: Your readers are going to feel impatient too.  Not enough is <em>happening</em>.   But what can you do about that?  In particular, how can you “plot” a novel that inherently lacks one?  Even more, how can you work alchemy when your process is exploratory, the opposite of applying a formula?</p>
<p>As a non-plot driven novelist your frustration can deepen when you consider classics and contemporary literary successes.  <em>To the Lighthouse</em>.  <em>The Bell Jar</em>.  <em>The Remains of the Day</em>.  <em>White Teeth</em>.  I mean, come on.  What really <em>happens</em> in these novels?  Almost nothing, and yet somehow it feels like everything.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with writing about the human condition.  It’s okay to examine characters who are stuck.  You could say that about Holden Caulfield, John Yossarian, Jay Gatsby and even Scarlett O’Hara, all characters who are not getting what they want.  Yet writers like Salinger, Heller, Fitzgerald and Mitchell make it look easy.  It’s not, that’s how it feels anyway.</p>
<p>Fortunately there are ways to “plot” the non-plot driven novel.  It doesn’t mean creating an outline.  It doesn’t depend on the gimmicky formulae of quest, save-the-world, whodunit or love conquers all.  It does, however, require taking a break from writing pages and asking yourself questions about your main character.</p>
<p>First, recognize that what holds a non-plot novel together and what gives it propulsive force every step of the way are two different issues.  Tackling each involves similar questions but applied in two different contexts: in the macro-text and in individual scenes.</p>
<p>Second, let’s generalize.  If your novel doesn’t, and cannot, have a plot as such then you are in some way or other working with a character who is blocked, frozen, hamstrung, bewildered, wandering, lost or in some other way unable to become whole and happy.  There can be a range of reasons for that: internal, circumstantial, past or some combo of things.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter why your main character is stuck.  It’s okay with me if he or she is.  Heck, we’re all stuck at times, even you.  What makes your manuscript a novel is that which ultimately causes your character to become <em>unstuck</em>.  The human condition by itself isn’t a story.  Change is.<span id="more-34553"></span></p>
<p>The approach I’m recommending today plays off your readers’ feeling of impatience.  If you think about it, that impatience is expressed not only as <em>I wish something would happen</em>, but as unspoken questions like these.</p>
<p><em>Why can’t the protagonist just get what he wants?</em></p>
<p><em>Why can’t she simply talk it out?</em></p>
<p><em>Why can’t he just walk away or quit?</em><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Why can’t she simply change?</em></p>
<p><em>No, seriously, why not?</em></p>
<p>Now let’s adapt those questions in two ways and use them in two contexts.  First with respect your manuscript as a whole, reframe the questions like this.</p>
<p><em>What big thing could my protagonist do to get the big thing that he wants?</em></p>
<p><em>What big thing has to happen before the big conflicts can be talked out?</em></p>
<p><em>Not what, but who, is actively holding back my protagonist?</em></p>
<p><em>My character could change but before that she must do or experience what?</em></p>
<p>Your answer to the first question is the start of a solid premise, meaning the overarching thing which must done for your character to become happy and whole.  That Big Thing is the focus, in a sense the “goal” or “problem”.  Of course the Big Thing is not easy to do.  Step by step we can find out why.  That, really, is the “plot” of your non-plot novel.</p>
<p>Some problems could be talked out or walked away from.  When they can’t, it’s often because someone else doesn’t make that easy.  That other character, then, can become the focus.  That other character is the “problem”.  The “plot”, then, is simply showing the many ways in which that problem character makes it impossible to reach an easy resolution.</p>
<p>When simply changing would make a character happy and whole, it would seem that there’s no actual reason for that not to happen.  Honestly, there isn’t.  However, change is often unlocked by a cathartic release.  A big brouhaha breaks out what is locked inside.  The Big Brouhaha, then, becomes the focus.  Anticipating it, avoiding it, running away from it, orchestrating it and ultimately arriving at it are, step by step, the “plot” of your non-plot novel.</p>
<p>Now, it’s good to set in place a big thing to do, a person who is a problem or a brouhaha to be feared/catharsis to be desired.  But that’s only a bookend to your story.  The middle needs to be dramatic too.  It doesn’t matter which scenes you choose to write, what matters is that things happen in them.  For each scene, then, adapt our list of questions like so:</p>
<p><em>What could my protagonist do—right now&#8211; to get what he wants?</em></p>
<p><em>What’s getting in the way—right now&#8211; of talking things out?</em></p>
<p><em>Who—right now&#8211;is holding back my protagonist and how?</em></p>
<p><em>My character is avoiding herself for what reason—right now?</em></p>
<p>The key, here, are those words “right now”.  As I said, it doesn’t matter which scenes you choose to write.  Every one of your choices has buried in it the answer to one of the above questions.  That in turn leads you to what can occur to enact, show, dramatize and make outward your answer.  Something can always <em>happen</em>, simply identify why it must.</p>
<p>All story questions have answers.  That’s true because <em>you</em> have them.  When you’re stuck simply ask the very questions the reader is asking.  Demand answers—and watch things begin to happen.</p>
<p><strong><em>What answers did you come up with?  What’s the focus of your non-plot novel?  What did you answer for the scene you’re working on today?</em></strong></p>
