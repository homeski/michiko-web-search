				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Copyright and Technology:</p>
<blockquote><p>Suppose you’re a musician.  You put your songs up on SoundCloud to get exposure for them.  Then you find out that SoundCloud has started a program for selling your music as high-quality CDs and giving you none of the proceeds.  Or suppose you’re a writer who put your serialized novel up on WattPad; then you find out that WattPad has started selling it in a coffee-table-worthy hardcover edition and not sharing revenue with you.  You’d be pretty upset, right?</p>
<p>Those are rough equivalents of what Flickr, the Yahoo-owned photo-sharing site, has been doing with its Flickr Wall Art program.  Flickr Wall Art started out, back in October, as a way for users to order professional-quality hangable prints of their own photos, in the same way that a site like Zazzle lets users make t-shirts or coffee mugs with their images on them (or Lulu publishes printed books).</p>
<p>More recently, Flickr expanded the Wall Art program to let users order framed prints of any of tens of millions of images that users uploaded to the site.  This has raised the ire of some of the professional photographers who post their images on Flickr for the same reason that musicians post music on SoundCloud and similar sites: to expose their art to the public.</p>
<p>The core issue here is the license terms under which users upload their images to Flickr.  Like SoundCloud, Flickr offers users the option of choosing a Creative Commons license when they upload their work.  Many Flickr users do this in order to encourage other users to share their images and thereby increase their exposure — so that, perhaps, some magazine editor or advertising art director will see their work and pay them for it.</p>
<p>The fact that a hosting website might exploit a Creative Commons-licensed work for its own commercial gain doesn’t sit right with many content creators, who have operated under two assumptions that, as Flickr has shown, are naive.  One is that these big Internet sites just want to get users to contribute content in order to build their audience and that they will make money some other way, such as through premium memberships or advertising.  The other is that Creative Commons licenses are some sort of magic bullet that help artists get exposure for their work while preventing unfair commercial exploitation of it.</p>
<p>Let’s get one thing out of the way: as others have pointed out, what Flickr is doing is perfectly legal.  It takes advantage of the fact that many users upload photos to the site under Creative Commons licenses that allow others to exploit them commercially — which three out of the six Creative Commons license options do.  It seems that many photographers choose one of those licenses when they upload their work and don’t think too much about the consequences.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Flickr is — still, after ten years of existence — a major outlet for photos online. As such, Flickr has the means to control, to some extent, what happens to the images posted on its service; and with Flickr Marketplace, it is effectively wresting some control of commercial licensing opportunities away from photographers. Some degree of control over content distribution and use does exist on the Internet, even if copyright law itself doesn’t contribute directly to that control.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>The problem here is the lack of both flexibility and infrastructure for commercial licensing in the Creative Commons ecosystem. Creative Commons is a clever and highly successful way of bringing some degree of badly-needed rationalization and automation to the abstruse world of content licensing. But it gives creators hardly any options for commercial exploitation of their works.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From The Daily Dot:</p>
<blockquote><p>In some ways, Jeremy Laszlo owes much of his career as a novelist to an intern in New York whom he’s never met before. Back in 2012, after speaking to literary agents and conducting research on the publishing industry, Laszlo submitted some of his manuscripts to several large book publishers. And then one day soon after, he received a reply in his email inbox. “It was supposed to be an interoffice email from the publishing house I had submitted to,” Laszlo told me in a phone interview. “And it was a couple of their interns joking back and forth. One of them said, ‘I just batch-rejected 600 authors.’ But they accidentally hit reply all and all the authors were included. They were joking about how they weren’t even reading any of the submissions. At that point, I was like, ‘You know what, I’m not going to bother with that anymore.’”</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>“I’ve always been a huge fan of fantasy, and that was my plan all along to write fantasy books,” he said. “And then Amazon started changed things and I realized that I needed to diversify, and to do that I figured I would move into other popular categories, like zombies.”</p>
<p>I was first clued in to the zombie phenomenon on Kindle a few months ago while visiting family in Texas. My aunt mentioned she was addicted to reading zombie ebooks. I asked her which ones. “I just do a search for the word ‘zombie’ and start downloading them,” she said. She mentioned that most of the authors she read didn’t have a publisher. Intrigued, when I returned home I did a search on the Kindle store, and, sure enough, I found an array of zombie ebooks, nearly all by self-published authors, and many with hundreds of customer reviews (an indication that a title has sold well).</p>
<p>Why do zombie novels do so well?</p>
<p>“Zombie fiction is a strange beast,” said Al K Line, author of an ongoing series called  <em>Zombie Botnet</em>. “At first glance you may think it is just about the blood and the guts, but it goes far beyond that. … The undead are the perfect platform for social commentary, to write stories about friendship, love, the human spirit and how people react under extreme duress.”</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, horror fiction is thriving on Kindle, and a sizable portion of ebook readers are drawn to the zombie subgenre. What’s more, most of the authors I interviewed for this story stumbled into their success, navigating by trial and error until they suddenly found themselves with thousands of ravenous fans, eager to consume the next books in their series.</p>
<p>Bobby Adair first got the idea to try out writing in the genre from his wife. “I was reading a zombie book that I didn’t like,” he recalled. “The ebook was rated fairly well on Amazon, and I was like, ‘This isn’t very good,’ and I was complaining to her about it when we were driving on the road. I think I might have said, ‘I can write better than this,’ and she said, ‘Why don’t you?’ She kind of put me on the spot. I thought, ‘Well why not?’”</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Publishers Weekly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Throughout the months-long dispute between Amazon and Hachette over e-book sales terms, Douglas Preston was one of the most outspoken authors on the matter. He went so far as to form a group to give authors a voice in the stalemate: Authors United.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>“I came into this a loyal Amazon customer, grateful to Amazon for selling my books,” said Preston. During the dispute, his then-forthcoming novel Blue Labyrinth (Nov., HBG), cowritten with Lincoln Child, looked like it could suffer collateral damage when Amazon removed the buy buttons for preorders and slowed shipping for Hachette titles—but he said that wasn’t his concern for starting Authors United.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p class="article">Preston said he was “shocked” by the decline in sales overall for Hachette titles through Amazon. To convey the scale of Amazon’s so-called shenanigans, Preston said that Amazon had to order more than one million copies of Hachette titles to restock after the two companies settled their differences. More than 3,000 authors and 8,000 titles were affected, and it took two weeks, from November 12 to November 26, the day before Thanksgiving, for Amazon to bring its inventory back to pre-sanction levels, he said.</p>
<p class="article">Preston’s disillusionment with Amazon dates back to his first phone call with Russ Grandinetti, Amazon’s senior v-p of Kindle content, when Preston thought that if Amazon understood how bad they were hurting authors they would change their tactics. Preston said that authors tend to think of their books like children, so Amazon’s actions struck especially close to the bone and felt, to many, like a personal attack. It wasn’t until the end of the conversation that Preston realized, to Amazon, books are a commodity like TV sets and diapers. “Amazon started with the assumption that all the authors wanted was money,” said Preston. “What we really want is an audience and to get people to read our books.”</p>

<blockquote><p>The internet has brought a great many things into this world, from social networking, email and memes to online dating and even arguably revolution. It has also given us Zoella. Zoella, or Zoe Sugg as she is known offline, is one of a new breed of online celebrities, an expanding group of video bloggers – or vloggers as they are more formally known – who, thanks to their YouTube channels, have developed a worldwide following to rival that of Beyoncé or even Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old, who has emerged at the head of the pack (she was recently described by Vogue as the queen of the internet), has had almost 307m views of her intimate videos dispensing beauty and life advice; 6.6 million people subscribe to her channel. And now, her first book, Girl Online, the fictional tale of a blogger, has become the fastest selling debut novel ever – selling 78,000 copies in its first week and eclipsing the debuts of JK Rowling and EL James.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Just how a fashion student from a small village in Wiltshire has come to define the zeitgeist is a testament to the DIY spirit that online platforms such as YouTube promote.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From author Alexandra Lanc:</p>
<blockquote><p> Some time ago (in October, which seems like centuries past now) I wrote my annual publishing anniversary post, talking about some things I&#8217;ve learned about publishing, writing, and myself over the last year, and the years before, but today I want to talk a bit about my publishing history too, and&#8230;my future?</p>
<p>I put a question mark there because it&#8217;s difficult to say what will happen in said future. I am confident, certainly, and I know what I think will happen, what I want to happen, but what we want is often not what we get &#8212; because often, what we get is in so many ways much better and stronger than what we want.</p>
<p>Such has been the case with my self-publishing: it has certainly not been anything I thought it would be, but in many ways it has been better, because I&#8217;ve learned so much from it, and have seen a side of myself that I would not have seen otherwise.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>I am twenty-three now, soon to be twenty-four, and I still get strange looks, snide comments, and the like when I tell people that I am an author. They haven&#8217;t gone away, though through the years I have met people who can recognize that it doesn&#8217;t matter how old you are &#8212; all that matters is the words &#8212; and those people constantly lift me up. So what if I&#8217;m not even twenty-five yet? Who said an author had to be older? Authors are as various as the stories that are penned, and that is a good thing. Age difference, background, religion, experience: all of these things give us different perspectives that should be respected, not tossed into the void.</p>
<p>Over four years ago (I started querying at about 17, I think), as the rejection letters poured in, and the market went crazy, and I searched for some way to be a writer despite the scowls I was receiving, I walked into a bookshop. It was a little bookshop, cozy and quaint, with wonderful shelves and a little cafe. On the side there was a large room where they held art classes for kids, and in the back there was a small cinema where they played old-fashioned cartoons, and independent, and black-and-white films. My mother and I happened upon the bookstore simply by chance &#8212; if you believe in that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Inside I searched, wide-eyed, as I do whenever I go into a bookstore. Fingers drift over spines, I inhale the sweet, musty smell of old pages, and the books seem to speak to me. Bookstores are a beautiful thing. But the real magic came when I went to pay for my books, and met the owner of the bookshop. I am ashamed to say that I cannot remember her name &#8212; I&#8217;ve always been terrible with names &#8212; but I can remember her face. She was a middle-aged woman, perhaps nearing her fifties, and she had curling hair, pulled back, brown. The air of an author hung about her, the air of literary dignity, and she thanked us for coming into the store. Then she mentioned her books, and pointed them out to us. They stood directly behind me on a loving little shelf of their own: children&#8217;s books with unique covers, which reminded me of mosaic stones. I flipped through the books and was amazed, and then I told her the terrifying truth: that I was a writer, too.</p>
<p>Only this woman didn&#8217;t scoff, didn&#8217;t judge. She was happy to hear it, and she asked me what I wrote, if I was going to get published, how long I had been writing. Finally, I was a <em>peer</em> instead of a sad little teenage girl with a dream she couldn&#8217;t possibly fulfill until she was at least fifty (because aren&#8217;t writers supposed to be at least fifty, maybe forty, maybe in their late thirties, if they&#8217;re lucky?). We talked for quite a while, and it felt amazing, to finally be considered a writer &#8212; and especially by someone who was published! But then she told me that she had published herself, and that I should look into it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit, I was skeptical. Self-publishing was still considered&#8230;eh&#8230;at that point, despite the fact that some people were doing quite well selling e-books . . . . But with the mass of rejections, and the fact that nobody seemed to want to take me seriously due to my age, I decided to look into it.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Through my four years self-publishing I have released nearly twenty books, though not all of them are still published &#8212; due to the fact that many of them have been experiments, have been ways for me to try different writing techniques, release times, story ideas, both to see what works in the market and what doesn&#8217;t; the information alone is very valuable to me. I have had several bestsellers on Amazon &#8212; not all of them free, though that still technically counts&#8230;in a way.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties, what I was given was, while not what I wanted, <em>exactly</em> what I needed. It has made me stronger, as trials do, and now I&#8217;m ready to take on the next leg of my journey.</p>
<p>What might that be, Alexandra? Well: querying. Things truly do come full circle.</p>
<p>Though I have enjoyed many things about self-publishing, I have come to understand that it simply isn&#8217;t the best route for me. I have never given up my hope and dream of one day being part of a large team, part of a publishing house, of seeing my book on the bookstore shelves (say what you like about print, but it still means the world to me), seeing my name and my book listed on a publisher&#8217;s site &#8212; and I&#8217;ll admit, a film would be great, too&#8230;or maybe a musical, a la Wicked; I aim high, always. This is my dream, and I&#8217;m prepared to fight to the death for it. It may take years, much sweat and tears, but nothing worth having comes easy.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Amazon launched the Kindle Unlimited service last July, the idea was that popular indie authors could use the service as a way to gather royalties and raise their author profiles in tandem. The all-you-can-eat reading service was supposed to help, not harm, authors.</p>
<p>The opposite has been the case. After the launch of KU a number of prolific writers have seen sales drop precipitously. The Digital Reader found a number of examples including writer H.M. Ward whose sales fell by 70 percent. She wrote:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">￼Ok, some of you already know, but I had my serials in it for 60 days and lost approx 75% of my income.Thats counting borrows and bonuses. My sales dropped like a stone. The number of borrows was higher than sales. They didn’t compliment each other, as expected.Taking a huge ass pay cut while I’m still working my butt off, well that’s not ok. And KU effected my whole list, not just KU titles. At the time of enrollment I had about 60 titles total.I planned on giving it 90 days, but I have a kid in the hospital for long term care and I noticed my spending was going to exceed my income-by a lot. I couldn’t wait and watch thing plummet further. I pulled my books. That was on Nov 1, &amp; since then my net revenue has gone up. I’m now at 50% of where I was pre-KU. During the time I was in KU, I had 2 new releases. Neither preformed vastly different than before. They actually earned far less (including borrows).</div>
<p>But Ward added an interesting aside near the end of her post: she would love to offer her readers a paid subscription to her work.</p>
<p>Ward, with 60 pieces in the Kindle store, is a rare case of a writer who is making a living from her writing through sheer volume. Most writers have one book in them at best but, as most Kindle experts note, the best way to make money is to write, publish, and repeat – ad infinitum.</p>
<div> By allowing users to subscribe to writers like Ward they will be doing everyone a solid. Ward and other writers will get a steady stream of income, readers will get the work of their favorite authors automatically, and Amazon has a captive source of revenue. Patreon, created by Jack Conte, is a perfect example of this dynamic. That service allows fans to pay a small amount every time an author creates a piece of content, be it a song, a blog post, or a podcast. By ensuring that the creator is paid the consumer ensures the content keeps coming.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From The Digital Reader:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the year draws to a close many are looking back at 2014 and reflecting on the year’s events. Today I would like to take a look at an event which would have been a huge news story if it had ever happened.</p>
<p>As you may recall, for much of 2014 Hachette and Amazon were in a nasty contract negotiation here in the US. As we all know from following the news, Hachette fought a vicious media campaign against Amazon as a way of pressuring Amazon to give in, but what no one else knew was that Hachette had a second string to their bow.</p>
<p>Just so you know: I have very little evidence to back up the following post. I trust my sources, and I do have a little evidence, but you should take this report with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Earlier this year Hachette secretly started developing an ebookstore calledwww.eBooksForAll.com. That store never launched, but my sources tell me that it would have sold Hachette titles in both Epub and Kindle formats.</p>
<p>Yes, Kindle. Hachette’s new ebookstore was going to use digital watermark DRM on the ebooks it sold.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>In short, Hachette nearly launched a site which could have directly competed with the Kindle Store. I can’t tell you why it was not launched, but I do have some more background details.</p>
<p>The site was developed by an Australia-based ebook company called eBooks.com, which would operate the site on behalf of Hachette. The  watermark DRM would have been supplied by Booxtream, which also provides a similar service to Pottermore and other ebook retailers.</p>
<p>eBooks For All was supposed to go live in the summer, and then in the early fall, but now that December has rolled around I figure the idea is probably dead, and thus it is safe to tell everyone about what would have been the biggest digital publishing story of the year.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Hachette apparently acquired the domain in April 2014, not too long after their previous contract with Amazon lapsed. Is it just me, or does that raise some new questions as to why the contract was allowed to expire?</p></blockquote>

<p>PG would have liked to see what Hachette&#8217;s idea of an ebook store looked like.</p>
<p>As PG has said, based on some personal ecommerce responsibilities in a past life, Amazon&#8217;s web site  is a work of sublime genius, the Mona Lisa of ecommerce sites.</p>
<p>(PG understands that appreciation for the art of ecommerce is a taste that most people never acquire. The Mona Lisa is easier to enjoy. He will note that Mona Lisa and Amazon share an enigmatic smile, however.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Dean Wesley Smith:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve mentioned this concept a number of times on my nightly blog and in the Topic of the Night little sections. But since Pulp Speed was almost impossible in the new traditional world, it belongs as a post in this series.</p>
<p>Not at all sure why this idea sort of hits me right. I think because it flies in the face of all the myths. A writer has to have all myths under control to even attempt this. So this post might just make you angry because it hits at belief systems I’m afraid.</p>
<p>The second reason I can’t shake this idea is because for all of my life I have idolized pulp writers.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Many, many of the great writers of the past that we still read and enjoy were pulp writers. And there are many pulp writers working today. More than you might imagine, even through the rough times of the last twenty years in traditional publishing.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Dickens was one of the early great Pulp Writers. And there were many along the way before the turn of 1900. It was then that the “literary” group split from the “writing for the masses” group of writers.</p>
<p>To the literary group, their writing had to be important, something to struggle to read, and only be published in leather hardbound books.</p>
<p>The masses group of writers just wanted to tell stories that would entertain readers.</p>
<p>Around this split period of 1900, the pulp magazines were coming in, and with the pulp magazine expansion, stories were needed to fill the pages of the exploding pulp magazine field. And the writers who could write sellable stories quickly discovered they could become very rich writing for one cent per word.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Doc Savage was a pulp character created mostly by Lester Dent and his publisher under a magazine house name. He wrote 159 of the Doc Savage novels for the Doc Savage pulp magazine, among many other books under other names, including his own name. There was a novel from Dent in most issues of Doc Savage Magazine for a decade or more. You can still buy Doc Savage novels by Dent today.</p>
<p>Some pulp writers got so famous, they were some of the richest people in the country. One year in the 1940s, the pen name Max Brand had thirteen movies in production from his books. Some of you may even remember Max Brand’s Dr. Kildare from television. Either the first television series or the second.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>By the way, the author behind Max Brand was Frederick Faust. Faust had a bunch of other prolific pen names besides Brand. For just one magazine group in the 1920s he wrote over a million words per year for the entire decade. Plus other stories and novels for other magazines.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>When the pulps finally died in the late 1950s, Pulp Speed writers turned to paperbacks through the 1960s and 1970s and wrote everything a publisher wanted. There were lots and lots of Pulp Speed writers producing upwards of 30 novels a year if not more. And most books were under many pen names and across many genres. Novels in this time period were still in the 40,000 word range.</p>
<p>In the 1980s publishers started to artificially inflate the size of novels because of the publisher’s need to charge more for a paperback. Pulp Speed writers kept on.  Numbers worked the category romance field, many worked westerns which had kept their smaller size.</p>
<p>And as normal, Pulp Speed writers worked across all genres. Fewer titles produced, but more words per book, so same production. Many Pulp Speed writers worked series novels for publishers during this period. And a lot of media novels.</p>
<p>But by the 1990s and early this century, most of the Pulp Speed writers had retired and very few new writers understood that Pulp Speed world was out there. It was almost impossible to understand when publishers limited a writer to one book per year. But some Pulp Speed writers still existed and worked through the period.</p>
<p>But now, with the advent of the indie world, Pulp Speed writers are coming back. It is possible again. And fun.</p>
<p>The golden age of fiction for readers has returned.</p></blockquote>
