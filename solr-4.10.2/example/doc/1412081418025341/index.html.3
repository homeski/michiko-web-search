		<description><![CDATA[Invest as much in books one, two, and ten as you did in book one. That is, don't shortchange books beyond the first one.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Most writers are</strong> nearly obsessive about their first novels. They spend inordinate amounts of time crafting the perfect opening line, the most captivating opening action sequence, a memorable final image.</p>
<p>Writers choose each word of that first effort with care and deliberation, changing and reworking until passages sing or scream or whisper with emotion—whatever it is they are supposed to do.</p>
<p>Writers work out intricate plot details and give characters scintillating dialogue. They know the story setting inside and out.</p>
<p>But by the time the writer has put together three or four mysteries featuring the same detective or has written four or five romances or the fifth story in an open-ended series, the writing can become stale. Common. Uninspired.</p>
<p>I’ve seen it happen more than once, this shift from the search for the perfect word or phrase to the acceptance of the ho-hum, but the practice seems more common to writers putting out books at a fast rate, perhaps in order to satisfy reader demand.</p>
<p>My suggestion is that you not shortchange the stories after the first one. Don’t shortchange any story or the reader, but be especially mindful not to hold back on books and manuscripts after that first one. Each novel (or short story or novella) deserves your best effort. Your best words. The full range of your skills and creativity.</p>
<p>Maybe writing the fifth or sixth novel won’t take as much time since you will have learned new tricks and techniques with subsequent stories. But the elements of good fiction should be found in subsequent books no less than in the first effort.</p>
<blockquote><p>Don’t settle for clichés or even common phrases in your stories. Think about craft, about putting what you know to work for you with every writing project.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don’t skimp on the good stuff just because you’ve got deadlines, especially if the deadlines are self-imposed.</p>
<p>Yes, meet your deadlines and don’t take forever between writing projects—I’m not saying that you shouldn’t meet deadlines. I am saying that if you’re going to skip anything, skip the common and the boring, not the necessary.</p>
<p>Common phrases—not quite clichés but phrases that could fit any story, thus not wording peculiar to <em>your</em> characters and plot—make stories seem familiar to readers. They make readers wonder if they’ve read the story before.</p>
<p>You don’t want readers thinking that your fifth novel sounds just like your fourth and, come to think of it, rather like the third as well. Instead of familiarity, you want readers feeling that each novel is new, with new revelations and adventures, even if the characters and/or setting are the same.</p>
<p>You definitely don’t want readers thinking that your book six sounds like the latest from Author X.</p>
<p>And I’m not referring to similar plot lines or characters, though those could be problems as well.</p>
<p>I’m talking about settling for common phrases again and again without expending the effort to come up with story-specific words.</p>
<p>Don’t tire of being creative. Don’t tire of writing for specific characters undergoing specific dramas and adventures in specific places and times.</p>
<p>Every story deserves your best effort. The readers you expect to buy your books certainly deserve your best.</p>
<p>Consider one of your WIPs—have you been coasting through the creation of it? Have you settled for common actions and descriptions and dialogue, content to just get the story down? Do you plan to accept it as “good enough” even though you know it isn’t your best, certainly not the quality of writing you should be producing?</p>
<p>Let me encourage you to push past the common, to go back to the days when you <em>crafted</em> a story, when you didn’t simply throw one out there. Write a work of high quality. Take your new skills and the tricks you’ve learned to not only write faster, but to write better. Write smarter.</p>
<p>Make your second and third and fourth stories at least as creative as the first. They should definitely be stronger in terms of the mechanics and in terms of the fiction elements.</p>
<p>Don’t hold back. Don’t try to get by. Don’t get tired of pushing toward perfection.</p>
<p>I encourage you to not sleep through the writing of your fifth or sixth or tenth books, assuming that your readers want the same old, same old. Give readers new phrasings, new imagery. Remind them of a character’s background or quirks if you’re writing a series or using recurring characters, but don’t give them the same wording again and again.</p>
<p>Give each adventure its own flavor and high points. Give each its own low points. Give every story a new twist or two. A new approach. A new hook.</p>
<p>Remind yourself that you’re not writing new chapters for the first book, but new chapters for a new book, a book that needs its own style and focus and impact.</p>
<p>Don’t shortchange your stories or your readers. Give each book your complete attention and all your creativity. Write great fiction, whether it’s your first or your twentieth book.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A membership area---to include a member-only forum, DIY lessons, and a once-monthly discussion on writing issues---is coming soon to The Editor's Blog.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I wanted to give everyone</strong> a heads-up about new features coming soon (one very soon) to The Editor&#8217;s Blog.</p>
<p><strong>Membership<br />
</strong><strong>Beginning this week if I can finish the setup, The Editor&#8217;s Blog will include a members-only section</strong>. Nothing will change here in the public areas of the blog&#8212;you&#8217;ll still find new articles on craft, on the mechanics of writing, and on encouragement for those days when you need a push. But I&#8217;m expanding the site to include a member forum, do-it-yourself (DIY) lessons, Fiction Talk&#8212;a once-monthly real-time discussion on craft issues and problem areas&#8212;and even some mini-classes (perhaps quarterly or monthly, depending on interest and scheduling realities). There will be a yearly membership fee for this service.</p>
<p>There will also be an ever-growing resource section, with useful links and information for both writers and editors.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">_________________________________</p>
<p>After the member area gets going, next to come will be books. I&#8217;ve been asked more than once to put together collections of related articles from the blog in book form&#8212;I plan to offer collections (PDFs) on both writing and editing topics. You&#8217;ll be able to purchase the collections, and a select few will be included as free downloads to paid members.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a couple other offerings on tap, but those won&#8217;t be started until after the new year.</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll continue to find what you need for both writing and editing here at The Editor&#8217;s Blog.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">_________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Professional Editors and Proofreaders</strong><br />
I&#8217;m also considering adding a separate forum for editors and proofreaders, a place where we can discuss not only craft, but other issues&#8212;how to approach an edit, the different services an editor could/should provide, techniques for explaining story and technical issues clearly to clients, and even techniques to improve our own skills.</p>
<p>Editors, feel free to leave comments about this issue, but I&#8217;ll be providing a link soon so you can share your comments and questions with me directly. Because membership to a Pro forum would need a filter, expect to be asked to offer confirmation that you&#8217;re a professional (or near professional) editor or proofreader in order to join such a forum.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited. This new service and the resources to be found there should help us all improve our skills.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have comments or questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>
<p>Several of you have asked about pricing. I&#8217;ll include my intended prices as of October 29,2014. These prices <em>may</em> change before registration begins, but I&#8217;m pretty firm about the numbers.</p>
<p>Memberships:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Founding Members</strong>&#8212;$35 for the first year and $50 renewal every year thereafter (until membership lapses or until the site closes, whichever comes first). The Founding Member level is a special offer that will be available for a limited time only&#8212;the first seven (7) days that membership is available.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy Members</strong>&#8212;$50 for the first year, $60 every year thereafter. Legacy Membership will also be available for a limited time&#8212;from the day the Founding Members introductory offer is over until December 31, 2014.</p>
<p><strong>General Membership</strong>&#8212;Beginning January 1, 2015, general membership will be $60 per year. This general membership price is subject to change. (As the membership site accrues resources, it&#8217;s likely the yearly membership fee will reflect the growth in content and value.)</p>
<p>No matter what the membership fee becomes after January 1, 2015, Founding Members will never pay more than $50 per year and Legacy Members will never pay more than $60 per year <em>as long as they don’t let their memberships lapse</em>. If Founding or Legacy members cancel membership or let it lapse and then want to renew, membership will renew at the then-current price (at least $60).</p></blockquote>
<p>Books</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>PDF Collections</strong>&#8212;Collections of related articles will be released as PDF books in the near future. Collections will have different prices, depending on the content, but I&#8217;m aiming for most to be between $3.99 and $6.99.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I haven&#8217;t written</strong> an article of encouragement recently, but since the National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo or NaNo) is next month, I thought I&#8217;d take a few minutes to encourage you to begin a new project, maybe push yourself into trying a new genre or writing style, if only as an exercise and only for 30 days.</p>
<p>I also needed a break from the article on misplaced modifiers I was working on. The examples and explanations were getting a bit tedious, so I figured a break was in order. I&#8217;ll get back to that article sometime later this week.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard of NaNo, but if not, check out the good folks that put on this very public and very fun challenge to write at least 50,000 words toward a new novel in 30 days. They&#8217;re at <a title="NaNo" href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo.org</a>.</p>
<p>There is no financial cost to participate, but there is an investment of time. If you&#8217;ve never written more than a couple hundred words a day, you&#8217;ll be surprised to find that <strong>you need to average 1,667 words a day for the month to &#8220;win&#8221; NaNo</strong>. Other than a badge you can display on your own website or blog, you don&#8217;t actually win anything tangible. But you can earn bragging rights. You may also lay the solid foundations of a new novel. Your efforts may see you break through writer&#8217;s block on another project. You may surprise yourself by succeeding at a genre new to you, maybe succeed at writing scenes in a point of view different from one you normally use or find success with a different narrative tense.</p>
<p>I wholly support NaNo and believe every writer should try it at least once. (I tried three times, but only won the first year. Still, I eventually finished the manuscript I started, my first shot at a genre I&#8217;d never attempted.)</p>
<p>The discipline of writing every day may be very different from your normal writing practice, but that&#8217;s a plus; different approaches produce different results. You <em>can</em> push yourself to write more than 200 or 300 words a day.</p>
<p><strong>Because of the relatively high word count, you&#8217;ll have to turn off your inner editor and censor and simply write, a marvelous way to get into the creative flo</strong>w. If you&#8217;re a deliberate writer, writing one exact word at a time, writing with freedom may not only help you create some very free passages, but the approach may get you out of a rut.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that writing this way will ultimately work for every writer, but it is worth exploring by every writer. It is worth your exploration.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not saying that you&#8217;ll have perfect prose at the end of the month&#8212;you may have only the vaguest kernel of a story or the basics for plot or character&#8212;but it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll produce some text you can use or you&#8217;ll have learned a new way to write freely without censoring every word choice.</p>
<p>And you may actually start a story that will ultimately be published&#8212;dozens of novels begun in NaNo have been published traditionally, while others have been self-published.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether or not you try NaNo this year, do consider trying something new in the next weeks or months&#8212;a different style, a different approach, a different type of protagonist. Push yourself to explore the craft in a way you&#8217;ve never done.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you always write a detailed outline, try beginning a new story with only the briefest of outlines. If you never outline, take the next few weeks and outline a new story so that you&#8217;re ready to begin at midnight on November first.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not ready to write, not ready to begin a new project, or don&#8217;t have the time to do so in November, commit to something else.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Read a new grammar book</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Work through <em>all</em> the exercises in a writing book</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Join a writing group and learn to critique</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Spend the month going in-depth with one or two of the fiction elements, preferably elements you either have trouble with or know nothing about&#8212;subtext? theme? mood?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Force yourself out of your comfort zone and make yourself uncomfortable with some writing element (saturate yourself with grammar rules) until you become proficient with it</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Read at least five to ten novels in a genre you don&#8217;t normally read or have never read</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Take an online writing course <em>and participate in the discussion groups and forums</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Find a critique partner</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Submit a finished manuscript to at least five agents or publishers</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you&#8217;re one who&#8217;s always online visiting writing groups and forums instead of actually writing, cut your Internet time and write instead&#8212;yes, I know this may be the most difficult suggestion of the group</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you&#8217;re one who never visits online writing sites and forums and have no idea what&#8217;s going on in the wider writing community, find a few sites and engage with writers already there</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Write some poetry</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Write a three-page synopsis or two for each of your completed manuscripts</p>
<p>I could go on and on with suggestions, but you get the picture&#8212;do something different and challenging. If your stories need an infusion, give them one by breaking out of whatever is commonplace and normal for you and try something else. <strong>Give yourself permission to try something radically different from your normal practices</strong>. Write at a different time of day. Go without lunch every day and give that time over to writing. Just try something different. Shake up normal and see what develops from doing so.</p>
<p>When you make a discovery, positive or negative, push beyond that single discovery and see what else you can discover. Don&#8217;t be satisfied with one revelation&#8212;search for more.</p>
<p>If you can try NaNo, do. If you succeed even partially, you&#8217;ll feel the success and it will spur you to try more.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s plenty of support for those who commit to NaNo</strong>. The NaNo website has forums where you can find encouragement as well as writing tips. There are groups online you can join, or you can physically meet up with groups in many countries around the world.</p>
<p>You can join groups where NaNo &#8220;teams&#8221; challenge other teams to word counts. Some groups even meet for writing sessions&#8212;they get together at cafes or libraries and have write-ins.</p>
<p>You can do this&#8212;I promise that you can. You may need help from a spouse or others in terms of logistics, but this is only one month out of a lifetime of months, a few hours a day&#8212;go for it. Push yourself to try something new. <strong>Push yourself beyond your long-held expectations</strong>.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t succeed, don&#8217;t write 50,000 words in one month, so what? There&#8217;s no shame in not meeting the goal. It&#8217;s a benchmark, not a do-or-die finish line. Try it. See what you can do. See what you can learn about writing, about yourself, about your stories and your style.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Press deep and stop settling for surface successes</strong>. There&#8217;s more inside you than surface-level discoveries. There are deeper emotions and more evocative phrases. There&#8217;s depth and strength and power. There is light and darkness. There are twists and calm seas and surprises. There are stories and characters and worlds that no one else can write.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are adventures and insights in your soul that no one else can uncover, that no one else has ever touched or seen or heard. There is power to create churning inside you, power that needs an outlet, that needs life, and only you can give life to that power, to the power that moves readers and opens their eyes to truths that only your heart understands. We&#8212;all the readers of the world&#8212;we need your gifts and your daring. We need you to be fearless. We need you to let out the stories that are roaring inside your soul.</p>
<p>Give the world your best&#8212;what good is only a percentage of your talent or your effort? What good is good enough when readers want passion and majesty and despair and victory over overwhelming odds? What good is so-so? What reader wants to spend time in a so-so world with so-so characters whose dilemmas don&#8217;t move that reader? That don&#8217;t offer hope? That don&#8217;t challenge? That don&#8217;t even entertain?</p>
<p><strong>No reader wants a writer to hold back</strong>. <em>No reader wants you to hold back</em>. Readers want the full gamut of emotions and adventures that beset characters. They want the richness of every emotion expressed to the nth degree. They want to cry and laugh and rage and fear. They want to feel.</p>
<p>Give readers what they want. Give them what they come to fiction for. Write with power and passion. <strong>Push beyond the safe and explore what the deep places have to say</strong>.</p>
<p>Push yourself. Rise above the ordinary and press into the deep places. Give all and not only part. Write us something astonishing.</p>
<p>Write the story of your heart.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Somehow is a nothing word that doesn't reveal anything new about a character or an event. Cut uses of somehow from your stories.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>We recently looked</strong> at a few words that I termed <em>nothing words</em>, words that usually serve as filler but don&#8217;t otherwise have much purpose in a sentence. Common nothing words include <a title="The Ubiquitous, Wandering It" href="http://theeditorsblog.net/2011/04/02/the-ubiquitous-wandering-it/">it</a>, <a title="Nothing Words—Thing" href="http://theeditorsblog.net/2014/09/08/nothing-words-thing/">thing</a>, and <a title="Nothing Words—People" href="http://theeditorsblog.net/2014/09/11/nothing-words-people/">people</a>&#8212;you can learn ways to substitute more specific words for these common words by following the links.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll look at one more nothing word today&#8212;<em>somehow</em>. While <em>somehow</em> can be used to reveal a character&#8217;s confusion or indecision, often it&#8217;s simply filler. And the sentence it&#8217;s in becomes no more than filler too.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Somehow I had misplaced the diary.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">She&#8217;d somehow forgotten to pick up her daughter after practice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The result was somehow not what he&#8217;d expected.</p>
<p>When you read such sentences do you want to say, <em>Of course these things happened somehow</em>? <em>Everything happens </em>some<em>how.</em> That is, what&#8217;s the point of saying so for this particular event since everything happens by means of something or another?</p>
<p>What purpose does such a sentence serve?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Somehow I typed the last sentence.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Somehow I woke up this morning.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Somehow today&#8217;s news didn&#8217;t seem new at all.</p>
<p>We could preface every action or event with <em>somehow</em>, but what would that accomplish? Not a thing. Using <em>somehow</em> without providing more information tells us nothing more than we knew before.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>When we don&#8217;t expand on the <em>somehow sentence</em>, it serves only as filler.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>And that&#8217;s what I see most often when a writer includes a <em>somehow sentence</em>&#8212;a<em> </em>line of filler that reveals nothing of plot or character or tone or conflict.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re only going to include sentences akin to those I&#8217;ve used here and do nothing else with them, cut them. They don&#8217;t tell the reader anything new&#8212;not about the events that have occurred and not about the character who says or thinks such sentences. However, if you want to reveal something about the character who uses such a sentence, give us more, not less. Don&#8217;t cut the <em>somehow sentence</em>, add to it.</p>
<p><strong>If the character is truly confused or is actually musing about the cause of an event, the use of <em>somehow</em> can be revealing <em>if you push beyond that first sentence</em>.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Somehow I had misplaced the diary, which was nothing like my usual meticulous self. I not only never lost any object, I never lost a thought or a memory. And yet today I&#8217;d lost all three.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My conclusion? I was either suffering from a brain tumor or I&#8217;d been drugged.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And the diary had been stolen from my possession.</p>
<p><em>Somehow</em> used in this way serves to draw the reader and the character deeper into the cause of the character misplacing the diary. <em>Somehow</em> becomes a doorway rather than pointless filler that might have readers saying, <em>Duh, of course it happened somehow</em>.</p>
<p>My advice for this one is simple: if your characters think or say s<em>omehow XYZ happened</em> but go no farther with the information, cut such uses of <em>somehow</em>. They serve no constructive purpose and may create a negative impression, with readers rolling their eyes and thinking, <em>Well, of course it happened somehow. Tell me something I don&#8217;t know</em>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no reason to alienate readers when cutting <em>somehow sentences</em> can prevent readers from thinking along these lines. And since the <em>somehow sentence</em> didn&#8217;t reveal anything critical, cutting it wouldn&#8217;t be a problem.</p>
<p>But if you want to press, want to delve into the reasons an event took place, want to show your character&#8217;s thought processes, try using <em>somehow</em> as that doorway into a deeper exploration of what happened. Push well beyond <em>something happened</em> and show us the character working through possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Most of the time you&#8217;ll want to cut the uses of <em>somehow</em>, but the word does have its uses and shouldn&#8217;t be banned. Just make it work for your fiction rather than against it.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">__________________</p>
<p>And while we&#8217;re talking about <em>somehow</em>, we shouldn&#8217;t forget the other <em>some</em> cousins.</p>
<p><em>Something, someone, somebody, somewhere, someplace, sometime(s), and somewhat</em> are legitimate words, but they too can be nothing words. In my experience, the use and overuse of <em>somehow</em> is a greater problem than the overuse of these other vague words, yet their use can make your writing inexact. Maybe even fuzzy.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you rely on such words rather than use explicit nouns, you run the risk of creating inexact images. You run the risk of writing <em>any</em> story rather than a specific story about specific people, places, and events.</p></blockquote>
<p>Word choice is critically important for directing your readers toward particular emotions and thoughts. <strong>Vague or imprecise words, especially when used often, dilute the impact of the specific words you&#8217;ve slaved over to create just the right effect</strong>.</p>
<p>Do away with imprecise words, including the <em>some</em> words. Finding them is easy&#8212;simply search for them. And then rewrite with impact in mind.</p>
<p>Reveal a character&#8217;s personality and emotional state, his education and background, by the words he uses at a particular moment. Make your word choices fit your characters at <em>this</em> juncture in their lives. Rather than use words that fit any and every character, use words that only one character would be thinking or saying at any given moment.</p>
<p>Use word choices to make your characters and plot events stand out from thousands of others.</p>
<p>Make your stories unique by making your characters unique.</p>
<p>Avoid nothing words and replace them with specifics that reveal exactly what you need to reveal to make your fiction original and intriguing for the reader.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Dangling modifiers continue to be a problem that I find in many manuscripts. But they can be easily identified and removed from your stories.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>One of the</strong> first grammar topics I wrote about at this blog was <strong><a title="Dangling Modifiers—A Common Writing Mistake" href="http://theeditorsblog.net/2010/06/19/dangling-modifiers-a-common-writing-mistake/">dangling modifiers</a></strong>. I came across a lot of them in manuscripts I read five years ago, and I&#8217;m still coming across a lot of them today.</p>
<p>They deserve another visit, an examination. They don&#8217;t deserve a place in your fiction.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s review what dangling modifiers are and explore ways to clear your manuscripts of this common writing mistake.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">__________________</p>
<p>Modifiers change the meaning of other words. Common modifiers are one-word adjectives and adverbs, but phrases and clauses (both adjectival and adverbial) can also be modifiers.</p>
<p>One type of phrase that often gives writers trouble is the <strong><a title="Participial Phrases? C’mon, You Made that Up" href="http://theeditorsblog.net/2011/02/06/participial-phrases-cmon-you-made-that-up/">participial phrase</a></strong>. It begins with a present or past participle, and the whole phrase operates as an adjective. It&#8217;s the misuse or misunderstanding of participial phrases that can give rise to dangling and misplaced modifiers.</p>
<p>Dangling and misplaced modifiers create nonsense or unintentionally humorous sentences that don&#8217;t mean what the writer intends for them to mean. While both misplaced and dangling modifiers are problems for writers, the focus of this article is the dangling modifier.</p>
<p>The difference between the two?</p>
<blockquote><p>A modifier is <em>misplaced</em> in a sentence when it doesn&#8217;t sit next to the word it is modifying. Trouble comes when the modifier seems to be modifying the wrong word due to that placement.</p>
<p>A modifier <em>dangles</em> when the word being modified, often a noun, isn&#8217;t even included in the sentence, when the modifier hangs from the sentence without an attachment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at examples to get a sense of how modifiers work. This first group shows examples of the correct uses of modifiers, with the modifiers (in red) easily paired with their nouns (in blue). (We&#8217;ll skip adverbs and adverbial phrases for this article.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The <span style="color: #ff0000;">quiet </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">night</span> was disturbed by <span style="color: #ff0000;">unholy</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">shrieks</span>. (adjectives)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wolves prowled the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eerie</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">forest</span>. (adjective)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Howling</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">wolves</span> prowled the hills above our home. (adjective)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Inside the farmhouse</span>, <span style="color: #0000ff;">Lucy</span> baked cookies. (prepositional phrase)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The <span style="color: #0000ff;">children</span> played with abandon, <span style="color: #ff0000;">tossing aside their fears</span>. (participial phrase)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Howling madly</span>, the <span style="color: #0000ff;">wolves</span> prowled through the night. (participial phrase)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Disturbed by the sounds</span>, <span style="color: #0000ff;">Chester</span> ran out of the house. (participial phrase)</p>
<p>Next, let&#8217;s turn the focus to participial phrases since they&#8217;re so often the cause of dangling modifiers. A few notes about participial phrases&#8212;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">they can be moved around in a sentence</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">depending on their location in the sentence, participial phrases follow a comma, are followed by a comma, or are bracketed by commas</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">they begin with a past participle (ending in -ed for regular verbs) or present participle (ending in -ing for all verbs)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a present participle is not the same as a gerund, although both end in -ing</p>
<p>In each of the following sentences, the position of the participial phrase is correct. The options give writers variety in crafting sentences. One option may feel, sound, or look better than the other options in a given sentence or paragraph.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Howling madly</span>, the <span style="color: #000000;">wolves </span>prowled through the night.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The wolves, <span style="color: #ff0000;">howling madly</span>, prowled through the night.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The wolves prowled through the night, <span style="color: #ff0000;">howling madly</span>.</p>
<p>Even used in a variety of locations in a sentence, the participial phrase makes sense. But what happens when the participial phrase is left with nothing to modify? When it seems to modify the wrong noun? Without a noun&#8212;with an implied but unstated subject&#8212;we create nonsense sentences or impossibilities. We create dangling modifiers.</p>
<p>A few examples of dangling modifiers in action&#8212;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tripping over his feet, the stairs proved to be Jack&#8217;s nemesis. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">X</span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Drunk beyond good sense, an accident was inevitable. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>X</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Looking to the sky, the stars were twinkling. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>X</strong></span></p>
<p>In the first sentence, I&#8217;ve said the stairs are tripping over his feet. Since stairs don&#8217;t have feet of their own and they can&#8217;t trip over someone else&#8217;s feet, I&#8217;ve created an impossibility and a dangling modifier. The subject of the sentence should be Jack, but I didn&#8217;t construct the sentence in a way that makes him the subject.</p>
<p>There are several ways to rewrite. You can even make the stairs the subject of the sentence.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tripping over his feet, Jack fell down the stairs that had proved to be his true nemesis.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">While tripping over his feet, Jack fell down the stairs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The stairs, Jack&#8217;s nemesis, had him tripping over his feet.</p>
<p>In the second sentence, I&#8217;ve said the accident was drunk. Again, an impossibility. Some <em>person</em> needs to be drunk. Corrections include&#8212;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Drunk beyond good sense, he faced an inevitable accident.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With Walter drunk beyond good sense, an accident was inevitable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">An accident was inevitable since Lysette was drunk beyond good sense.</p>
<p>In the third sentence, the stars were looking to the sky. To correct the dangling modifier, we need to add a person or animal who can look to the sky, or reword and make the stars the subject of the sentence.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Looking to the sky, Lucy saw that the stars were twinkling.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Looking to the sky, Edgar counted the twinkling stars.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The stars twinkled in the night sky.</p>
<p>The fixes for dangling modifiers are easy to write and can often help make a sentence more pointed, more specific, but a writer first has to <em>notice</em> the dangle.</p>
<p>If you know you create dangling modifiers, be sure to <strong>check every sentence that begins with a participial phrase</strong>; participial phrases at the beginning of sentences are usually the ones that cause the most problems.</p>
<p><strong>Look at the noun that follows the comma</strong>: is it the subject of the sentence? Is it the noun that is being modified by the participial phrase that precedes it? If not, it&#8217;s likely you have a dangling modifier.</p>
<p><strong>If you have trouble figuring out whether or not there&#8217;s a problem with the participial phrase, change its position in the sentence</strong>. You may see the problem more clearly with the participial phrase in a different sentence location, especially if it&#8217;s in the middle of the sentence.</p>
<p>These definitely don&#8217;t make sense&#8212;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The stairs, tripping over his feet, proved to be Jack&#8217;s nemesis. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">X</span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The stairs proved to be Jack&#8217;s nemesis, tripping over his feet. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>X</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">An accident, drunk beyond good sense, was inevitable. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>X</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">An accident was inevitable, drunk beyond good sense. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>X</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The stars, looking to the sky, were twinkling. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>X</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The stars were twinkling, looking to the sky. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>X</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Other Dangling Modifiers</strong></span></p>
<p>While participial phrases are the most common dangling modifiers, other modifiers, including regular adjectives, can dangle as well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Bloodied and bruised, the boxing match proved too much. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">X</span></strong></p>
<p>Unless the match was bloodied, this is a dangling modifier with no noun to attach itself to. Better would be something such as one of these sentences that name the character who is bloodied and bruised&#8212;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The boxing match proved too much for a bloodied and bruised Clarence.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Bloodied and bruised, Roy conceded the boxing match.</p>
<p>One more&#8212;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Too salty, Tanya needed a glass of water. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>X</strong></span></p>
<p>What was too salty? Not Tanya, though that&#8217;s what this construction says. Rewrite for clarity and accuracy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tanya needed a glass of water for her salty lips.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The fries were too salty, and Tanya needed a glass of water.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">__________________</p>
<p>Dangling modifiers can create confusion for the reader. They can lead to unintended humor. They can create wording that&#8217;s inexact.</p>
<p>Dangling modifiers can reveal a writer&#8217;s inattention to detail. To effect. To the reader&#8217;s sensibilities.</p>
<p>But they can so very easily be eliminated. And they should be.</p>
<p>The key for eliminating dangling modifiers is to make sure each sentence actually says what you intend it to say. Make sure the noun that is being modified can do what you&#8217;ve said it is doing. Make sure the subject of the sentence is stated, not merely implied. Make sure you are modifying the object or person you think you are modifying.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Including the words "The End" on the final page of a manuscript is a good idea. The visual keeps readers, including agents and editors, from guessing what the story's final words are.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>In an article</strong> on <a title="Format Your Novel for Submission" href="http://theeditorsblog.net/2011/01/05/format-your-novel-for-submission/">manuscript formatting</a>, a reader asked about including <em>The End</em> at the end of a manuscript that would be submitted to agents or publishers. I gave reasons for my answer there, but I thought the topic should be addressed in an article of its own.</p>
<p>The question&#8212;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I&#8217;ve had other editors/authors/instructors say that your manuscript needs more work if you have to put “The End” at the end. They should be able to tell the story is over. Your opinion?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>My answer (embellished, of course)&#8212;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard the same comment. And while I agree in part&#8212;last lines should resonate and clearly identify the end of all the plot threads in a novel, they should be a satisfactory conclusion to the characters&#8217; adventures&#8212;sometimes a final zinger could follow what seems to be the ending, maybe a line or two that opens a story for a sequel or that points to the next book in a series or that creates a hint of ambiguity. Such a line could easily get lost at the top of an otherwise blank page, leaving readers to think the story ended at the bottom of the previous page.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m for anything that makes the read clear for readers</strong>, and readers include agents and editors at publishing houses. You include a chapter title on the first page of the story so readers know it&#8217;s the first page&#8212;why not include a visual marker to show that the last page is indeed the final page?</p>
<p>If, however, you find an agent or editor who’s said you don’t need to include<em> the end</em>, don&#8217;t include those words in your submission to him or her. Always check websites and submission guidelines for anyone you&#8217;re submitting to and submit according to their guidelines. They have reasons for what they want to see and the format they want you to use&#8212;it&#8217;s to your benefit to <strong>include only what they ask for and nothing that they specifically don&#8217;t want</strong>.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t include <em>the end</em> for agents or editors who have specifically noted that they don&#8217;t want or need the visual marker for the end of a manuscript. But for the rest? Go ahead and show them where your story ends.</p>
<p>Let me suggest reasons to tell your manuscript&#8217;s readers where the end is.</p>
<p>For all of a writer’s efforts, some manuscripts don’t yet have a complete or satisfying ending when they reach agent or publisher, and agent or publisher may not be able to tell whether or not she’s reached the end. Yes, she can guess. But why should she have to? And, if agent or editor or anyone else reads that far and loves the story, they aren&#8217;t going to ding the writer simply because he finishes his manuscript with <em>the end</em>.</p>
<p>Also, those who offer advice about not including a visual confirmation of the end may be assuming that all readers will be reading a manuscript from beginning to end and thus should be able to tell they&#8217;ve reached the story’s conclusion. But what of those who might be looking through the pages searching for something and not actually reading?</p>
<p>If I&#8217;ve got a stack of pages in front of me (I read from hard copy), and I want to identify the last page, I expect to see something there to identify that page. I can’t be sure I’ve printed every page or pulled all the pages from my printer; I want proof there’s no more story beyond the final period on that last piece of paper.</p>
<p>Or I may want to compare the opening pages with the final ones. Again, it’s easier to find the last page when I see the words <em>the end</em>. I may also want to compare the last page of every chapter, see what they have in common. Again, I want to be able to do this easily. In this case I’m relying on a visual, not the meaning of the words.</p>
<p>The same would be true if I read from a monitor or screen&#8212;show me the ending in a visual way; don’t make me guess where it is. And <strong>don’t make me have to read the full manuscript to identify that end</strong>.</p>
<p>I sometimes read a few chapters at the opening of a manuscript and then skip to the end to see how the writer has linked these two parts of the story. I don’t want to wonder if I’m missing something. I want to see how the last line compares to the first, how the last paragraph compares to the first paragraph. Knowing exactly where the story ends is helpful and not a hindrance.</p>
<p>And what of stories with multiple endings? If a story is complex and deals with several issues, the end may also be complex. A reader could easily stop after what seems to be the ending, only to find more text dealing with other story issues. This would be rare, admittedly, but a writer definitely wouldn&#8217;t want an agent or publisher or editor to miss the final pages.</p>
<p>Could you use a number sign at the end (<strong>#</strong>), the same symbol used for scene breaks? You could. But you run the risk of the agent or editor assuming that it <em>is</em> a scene break and that more text will follow. <em>Do</em> use the number sign (or even a group of three of them&#8212;<strong>###</strong>) for submissions to those who&#8217;ve specifically asked writers to not include the words <em>the end</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just as you do with the words <em>the end</em>, center the number sign(s) on a line of their own following the final words of the story.</p></blockquote>
<p>Readers should have no doubt they’re reading or looking at the final page of the manuscript. Help them out with the visual no matter how they reach that final page or what they intend to use it for.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That&#8217;s it, a short bit of advice for your submissions. Don&#8217;t include <em>the end</em> for agents or editors (and professors and teachers) who don&#8217;t want it. For everyone else, include the words. Identify your final page and last words with a visual understandable to all.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Like "thing," "people" is a nothing word. A filler. But you can easily change the bland and generic "people" to a word that better fits the scene and the character using the word. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>We&#8217;ve already looked</strong> at a couple of nothing words&#8212;<a title="Nothing Words—Thing" href="http://theeditorsblog.net/2014/09/08/nothing-words-thing/"><em>thing</em> </a>and <a title="The Ubiquitous, Wandering It" href="http://theeditorsblog.net/2011/04/02/the-ubiquitous-wandering-it/"><em>it</em></a>. Let&#8217;s now look at <em>people</em>, a perfectly useful word, but one that may get more use in your fiction than it deserves and more use than is good for your story.</p>
<p>As a reminder, nothing words add little to mood or emotion, do little to reveal the personality of the character who speaks or thinks them. Nothing words are often fillers, taking the place of more specific words whose use would be a better fit for genre or era, for character or the current scene. At best, <em>nothing</em> words are neutral, neither creating a feel or effect nor interfering with the feel of surrounding words. At their worst, nothing words destroy the impact of other word choices, leaving a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or even a scene either muddled or weaker than it should be.</p>
<p>The use of words I&#8217;m calling nothing words is not prohibited&#8212;sometimes they are exactly the right word. And sometimes their use isn&#8217;t harmful. But <strong>used at the wrong time or used in a way that builds up over the course of a scene, chapter, or story, nothing words can dull an otherwise crisp piece of writing</strong>.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to use them too often. You don&#8217;t want to use them when more accurate words are available and called for. You don&#8217;t want to use them only because you don&#8217;t want to take the time to figure out a stronger, more pointed wording.</p>
<p>Just because they&#8217;re okay doesn&#8217;t mean you should carelessly toss nothing words into your stories, scattering them about as if they add flavor. They don&#8217;t. And you definitely don&#8217;t want to use them when the intent is to create a captivating or narrowly focused phrase.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just as you don&#8217;t pick any old word for important lines and critical scenes but instead choose key words with deliberation, you also don&#8217;t want to use a nothing word unless it&#8217;s the right word in the right place, unless it&#8217;s the best word to accomplish your purposes.</p></blockquote>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to use <em>people</em> unless it&#8217;s the word you need.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">________________________</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>People</strong></span></p>
<p><em>People</em> is a solid word, but it&#8217;s truly unspecific. Just who are we referring to when we say <em>people</em>? Are we pointing out humans in comparison to objects? Humans in comparison to aliens, living beings who aren&#8217;t from Earth?</p>
<p>If so, <em>people</em> would be appropriate. But so would <em>human</em>. And <em>human</em> might be the more accurate term.</p>
<p>But in other instances, <em>people</em> is simply filler.</p>
<p>So why do writers use <em>people</em> so often? And I can confirm that they do. At least in manuscripts.</p>
<p>I think much of the reliance on and overuse of the word <em>people</em> came from writers wanting to get away from the use of <em>man</em>. Or maybe I should say writers wanting to get away from <em>complaints</em> regarding the use of <em>man</em>. But just as <em>man</em> was generic and all-inclusive&#8212;referring to all, so not referring to any in particular&#8212;so is <em>people</em>. And writers can do much better than use generic and all-inclusive words when they want to refer to a particular group of humans.</p>
<p>Words create effects. Words create emotion and action. Words create worlds. And while the right word (there could be multiple right words for any sentence) adds to a scene, the wrong word can destroy it or at least mute it, making it less than it could or should be.</p>
<p>So what can words do?</p>
<p><strong>The Right Word</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The use of an exact word, a specific and narrowing word, helps keep the reader inside the fictional world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The right word provides focus for characters, writers, and readers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The right word can deepen the effects a writer is trying to create.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The right word can pull the reader along the story&#8217;s path.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The right word can establish or echo the setting. It can reveal the personality of the character who uses it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The right word can increase tension and raise the conflict level.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The right word can bring humor or levity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The right word can convey theme.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The right word can strike chords in the reader.</p>
<p><strong>The Wrong Word</strong> (or words used at the wrong time)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The wrong word can diffuse a scene&#8217;s focus, can shatter a moment.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The wrong word can pull readers out of the fictional world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The wrong word may cause the writer to go off on the wrong track.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The wrong word can negatively affect mood or tension.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The wrong word can fail to enhance setting or fail to remind readers of the setting.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The wrong word may lessen conflict when instead it should be building conflict.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The wrong word may not fit the character, the era, or the genre and thus confuse the reader.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The wrong word can bring humor or levity at the wrong time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The wrong word can strike the wrong chords in the reader.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The wrong word, even if it doesn&#8217;t create a negative impact, may fail to create any impact. And the piling up of bland or imprecise words over the length of a manuscript can dull even the most fascinating plot.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">________________________</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Back to People</strong></span><strong>. . .</strong></p>
<p><em>People</em> is a bland word. When we don&#8217;t need it to show a contrast to <em>alien</em> or <em>object</em>, when we actually mean to refer to a specific group of humans but a group smaller than the all-inclusive <em>people</em>, then we should be using a more specific word.</p>
<p>Rather than use <em>people</em>, show the reader just who you mean. It&#8217;s okay to say <em>men</em> when you&#8217;re speaking only of men. The same is true for <em>women</em> or <em>teenagers</em>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s okay to be specific; being specific is actually a requirement for writing strong fiction. And it&#8217;s so very okay to exclude some groups and individuals. You&#8217;re not telling the story of every man, woman, or group. You&#8217;re not always referring to every man, woman, and child on the planet.</p>
<p>Using words that exclude some of a thing while including others&#8212;whether we&#8217;re talking humans, cities, events, or any other large group of items&#8212;is necessary for fiction. Using specifics keeps your story focused on <em>your</em> story&#8212;the events and characters that exist only in this one world, the one between the pages of a particular book.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that your story couldn&#8217;t or won&#8217;t appeal to every man or woman in the world (though it won&#8217;t). I&#8217;m not talking about the reader at all here. And I&#8217;m also not saying that you can&#8217;t write about an &#8220;everyman&#8221; character. But in reality you aren&#8217;t writing about every man. <strong>You&#8217;re writing about a man or a woman of particular motivations who possesses a specific history and who is now caught up in a specific set of circumstances.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t try to be inclusive and write about all people in general. Instead, write about a particular man or woman&#8212;John the award-winning actor or Jane the CFO of an international corporation. And then extend this attitude toward individual characters to all the characters in your story and even to individuals or groups given a one-off mention.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rather than refer to people in general, refer to a particular group. Focus on something that makes a group unique and use that as the identifier. So rather than a character saying <em>people told me not to spank my child</em>, try <em>busybodies told me not to spank my child</em>. Or maybe <em>critics told me not to spank my child. </em>Armchair experts? Know-it-alls?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My sisters told me not to spank my child.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Strangers on the subway told me . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My co-workers told me . . .</p>
<p>Keep us inside the story world and the character&#8217;s frame of reference by using specifics. Remind the reader of the setting by using words that point to it and not to some general setting that could fit any story. <strong>People groups in your story world are part of the setting; use references to them to color the story</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Specifics bring clarity and focus. Specific words that pinpoint one group while excluding others help readers picture exactly what&#8217;s going on and to whom.</p></blockquote>
<p>Using a specific word rather than the generic <em>people</em> can also keep a passage from sounding like a researcher&#8217;s report&#8212;<em>It&#8217;s been discovered that people do such and such</em>.</p>
<p>And the use of a specific word may help writers choose surrounding words to get even more specific. To be even more exact in what they&#8217;re saying.</p>
<p>We can even substitute a single character&#8217;s name in place of the bland <em>people</em>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say Nancy and her mother are talking about Nancy&#8217;s sister Jane, with Mom wringing her hands over Jane&#8217;s behavior.</p>
<p>We could write the common and clichéd&#8212;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;People do what people are gonna do, Mom.&#8221;</p>
<p> Or we could write something that reveals Nancy&#8217;s personality as well as her sister&#8217;s&#8212;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Jane is a user, Mom. And I&#8217;m tired of her using you.&#8221;</p>
<p>This specificity allows the writer to zero in on these characters and their problems, to focus on certain people and not on the whole seven billion human inhabitants of our world.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at more examples to get you thinking about ways to change <em>people</em> to a more pointed word that fits setting, era, genre, characters, and story events. Keep in mind that changing <em>people</em> to a more exact word may also lead to other changes in a sentence and scene.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">People </span>in love display their affection easily.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lovers </span>show their affection freely.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Teenage lovers</span> don&#8217;t care who sees them kiss.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Exhibitionists</span> in love don&#8217;t care who sees them carry on.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nellie hurried through the <span style="color: #0000ff;">people </span>loitering at the doors.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Nellie hurried through the <span style="color: #ff0000;">crowd</span> loitering at the doors.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Nellie hurried through the <span style="color: #ff0000;">crush</span> pushing through the doors.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Nellie hurried through the <span style="color: #ff0000;">commuters</span> . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Nellie hurried through the j<span style="color: #ff0000;">erks blocking her way</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;It was those damned <span style="color: #0000ff;">people</span> over in the compliance unit that did it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#8220;It was those damned <span style="color: #ff0000;">losers</span> over in . . .&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#8220;It was those damned <span style="color: #ff0000;">fact checkers</span> over in . . .&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#8220;It was those nosy <span style="color: #ff0000;">pencil pushers</span> over in . . .&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The <span style="color: #0000ff;">people</span> I&#8217;m talking about are the ones who yack . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The <span style="color: #ff0000;">gossips</span> I&#8217;m talking about . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The <span style="color: #ff0000;">women</span> I&#8217;m talking about . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The <span style="color: #ff0000;">false friends</span> I&#8217;m talking about . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Which <span style="color: #0000ff;">people</span> were responsible for the damage this time?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Which <span style="color: #ff0000;">group</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">was</span> responsible . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Which <span style="color: #ff0000;">hooligans</span> were responsible . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Which <span style="color: #ff0000;">gang was</span> responsible . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Whose <span style="color: #ff0000;">little darlin&#8217;s</span> were responsible . . .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Which [or whose] <span style="color: #ff0000;">#*&amp;#$ monsters</span> were responsible . . .</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">________________________</p>
<p>Is that enough to get you started, to get you thinking about ways to change the generic and bland <em>people</em> to a word that better fits every other story element?</p>
<p>Search your manuscripts for the word <em>people</em>. Decide on the group you really want to refer to in each instance and then find a word that fits that group. Start making changes.</p>
<p>As with using the generic <em>things</em> for objects, using <em>people</em> instead of a specific word makes your writing inexact and unfocused. Show your characters&#8217; concerns by choosing words that highlight those concerns. Reveal your characters&#8217; personalities and emotions by using words that show how they&#8217;re feeling at one particular moment.</p>
<p>Replace the generic with the specific, the general with the focused. Cut out uses of <em>people</em> and replace them with words that are a better fit, a more precise fit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t leave a talk about <em>people</em> without a peek at a well-known and enjoyable use of the word.</p>
