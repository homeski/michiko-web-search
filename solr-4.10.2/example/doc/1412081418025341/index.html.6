				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="triberr_endorsement"></div><p><b>As writers, we want to make our characters as unique and interesting as possible. One way to do this is to give your character a special skill or talent that sets him apart from other people. This might be something small, like having a green thumb or being good with animals, to a larger and more competitive talent like stock car racing or being an award-winning film producer. </b><br />
<b><br />
</b><b>When choosing a talent or skill, think about the personality of your character, his range of experiences and who his role models might have been. Some talents might be genetically imparted while others are created through exposure (such as a character talented at fixing watches from growing up in his father’s watch shop) or grow out of interest (archery, wakeboarding, or magic). Don’t be afraid to be creative and make sure the skill or talent is something that works with the scope of the story. </b></p>

<p>Why do the best ideas come in the middle of the night, when we have nothing to write with, and getting up from the warmth of blankets is a Herculean task? Perhaps it is karma for all the bad things we do to our protagonists.</p>
<p>Well, in your face, karma! This <a href="http://www.morsex.com/misc/pens.htm">LED pen</a> will let you jot down your ideas before they slip away!</p>

<p>What are Joulies? Oh, just a remarkable bean invention that keeps your coffee HOT FOR HOURS.

<p>Toast your way to greatness! Gaze upon the face of a literary icon, then slather him with marmalade and consume his genius, bite by delicious bite. Be sure to say &#8220;<span class="st">Klaatu <em>Verata</em> Necto</span>&#8221; a few times, and we&#8217;re pretty sure MAGIC will ensue.</p>
<p>(Besides, don&#8217;t pretend you don&#8217;t want <a href="http://www.burntimpressions.com/stock-inserts.php#!/Edgar-Allen-Poe/p/42346000/category=10823134" class="broken_link">this toaster</a>, especially when it comes with many different designs including Clowns, Skulls and the Death Star!)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="triberr_endorsement"></div><p><span style="color: #ff6600;">I have a confession. *whispers* <em>I&#8217;ve never been interested in writing short stories.</em> I put so much planning and research into my writing that it always seemed like kind of a waste of time to write something so&#8230;short. But after hearing Ian Martyn&#8217;s arguments in favor of short story writing, I can absolutely see his point. As a matter of fact, I think I&#8217;m going to recommend his Inspiration Word exercise to my writing group&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In one of my blogs, I advocate blog writing as a tool for improving your writing, whatever your genre or subject. However, today I want to champion short story writing, and also the reading of short stories. I think too often these pieces are dismissed as less important than full-length novels—somehow frivolous or not worthy of our attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I’m a member of a writing group, and at the end of every session we are given a word. We can write whatever we want, and occasionally I have experimented with poetry, which for a fiction writer is always an interesting exercise. However, most of my efforts result in short stories. Some of the stories on my site come from those inspiration words: <em>Weather Vane, Dancing, Pickpocket, Watching</em>. I have numerous others, some of which I am trying to edit and submit to competitions and others that I will try to publish.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So as an author, why should you spend your precious time on short stories?</span></p>
<div id="attachment_11327" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aprillynn77/24111292/in/photolist-38zrX-8QKuz4-37Tp3m-8dh9tU-hjbY9-5BJrNp-dEK32f-9uekHs-cUxeGq-hKEF7R-4RevVU-4uyrcn-6xDeFF-38zrW-6aH1Sc-8p35CL-5Z241e-Zm3sr-5Gsigr-8mMA88-5BJkg9-5eYk97-6TpAdd-68rcQL-9pRzps-6Tpzr7-6TpzfC-at2T9V-rcZ-9WbE1c-cKNF5y-ciirrA-4Revkf-5GsiYt-4xBQtC-9vZFQW-5eYeK9-99jZ8m-3ftCGg-5GsmFz-nkvMH-2KEwfN-fBm85W-gHgSha-4jm9XZ-4zduiF-4zhJib-cCpLco-hPXoef-hrfk9G" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-11327 size-medium" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/24111292_3bdcd3d997_b-300x200.jpg" alt="24111292_3bdcd3d997_b" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">April Killingsworth @ Creative Commons</p></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They’re fun.</strong></span> I mean it, they are. In my writing group, we’re given a word and one week to produce the goods. (OK sometimes I get behind, but never mind). For me, the result turns out to be about 1500 words long; I think the reason for this is because with a piece of this length, there is enough room to explore a topic without distracting me too much from my other work. Anyway, after some wracking of brain cells I get the first inkling of an idea and then run with it. For a writer, that’s great. Enthusiasm for writing any story is usually greatest at the beginning. When writing shorter works, you get to feel that energy more often—energy that will often transfer to your other writing projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">2) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They provide the opportunity for quicker feedback.</strong></span> Because short stories don’t take as long to write, you’re able to share more often with writing groups or critiquers. This means you get feedback faster and can more quickly apply what you’ve learned during the process. If you’re not a member of a writing group, pass your short story around to friends and family and ask them for feedback. It’s a little easier than having them review something you’ve worked on for months. Also, non-writers will find a shorter piece less daunting to critique, and they’re more likely to be honest, especially if you tell them you’re ‘experimenting’.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">3) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They provide the chance to experiment</strong></span>. Short stories provide the opportunity for you to try out new ideas, writing styles, even different genres, to see if they work. It’s hard to do this with a novel, because you’re often too invested to feel comfortable experimenting. I’ve read science fiction short stories by a number of authors including Asimov and Alistair Reynolds, and I’m sure this was their goal (in part) when writing these successful pieces.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">4) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They provide more outlets for getting your work out there.</strong> </span>Earlier, I mentioned my intent to enter some of my short stories in competitions. I also intend to submit more to magazines. If you are inspired to write short stories or you have a few already gathering dust, why not do the same? What have you got to lose? If you’re successful, you’ve gotten your name out there. Even if you don’t succeed, you’ve gotten valuable experience polishing a piece for publication, and that’s good practice for when you’re revising your novels.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">5) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Reading short stories gets the wheels turning</strong></span>. Take time out from reading novels to try short stories. It’s a great way to sample different ideas and styles, learn, and get inspiration. In the ‘Inspiration’ section of my site I list Robert Silverberg’s ‘Science fiction 101’, in which he reviews some classic sci-fi short stories, explaining why he thinks they’re so good. For anyone writing short stories in this or any genre, I would recommend taking a look at these. Then pick out other writers’ shorts to check out. And don’t forget all the <a href="http://letswriteashortstory.com/literary-magazines/" target="_blank">short story magazines</a>; there are many out there in all genres</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So that’s five reasons why I think writing (and reading) the humble, often overlooked short story is such a good idea.

One way to do this is to give your character a special skill or talent that sets him apart from other people. This might be something small, like having a green thumb or being good with animals, to a larger and more competitive talent like stock car racing or being an award-winning film producer. </b><br />
<b><br />
<a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/folder.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-11291 size-medium" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/folder-199x300.jpg" alt="folder" width="199" height="300" /></a></b><b>When choosing a talent or skill, think about the personality of your character, his range of experiences and who his role models might have been. Some talents might be genetically imparted while others are created through exposure (such as a character talented at fixing watches from growing up in his father’s watch shop) or grow out of interest (archery, wakeboarding, or magic). Don’t be afraid to be creative and make sure the skill or talent is something that works with the scope of the story. </b></p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #800000;">ORGANIZATION</span></h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Description</b></span>: The ability to discern what is needed for a particular project or event, and then to prepare and collect any people, resources or information into a state of readiness so that everything moves forward efficiently.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Beneficial Strengths or Abilities</b></span>: A good organizer can look at what must be done and immediately formulate a plan of action that is effective and insightful, taking into consideration any factors that might create challenges so that they can be prevented or minimized. Having foresight of what the path ahead may look like, being educated and familiar with common practices and factors that may cause friction regarding the project needing organization are both important. Punctuality, thoughtfulness, and being able to articulate oneself well will help one obtain resources, support and help as needed. A good organizer has strong time management skills, can split their attention to complete different action items, and is able to set aside their ego and be a team player. Projects might be small, day-to-day items requiring navigation, or larger events that involve many people, resources and high stakes.<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://writershelpingwriters.net/2010/10/character-traits-thesaurus-collection/">Character Traits</a><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;"> Suited for this Skill or Talent</span></span></b><span style="color: #000000;">: efficient, orderly, articulate, friendly, inspiring, tenacious, analytical, hard working, clever, imaginative, visionary, trustworthy<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Required Resources and Training</b></span>: A strong organizer usually has checklists and time management tools to keep both herself and others on task, ensuring all pieces of the project are in place each step of the way. Experience can also be gained by volunteering under the leadership of a mentor will expose them to the many different factors that goes into organizing a project or event. Understanding a particular subject, industry or set of circumstances will require investigation and/or experience. For example, a planner for a climbing expedition must understand mountaineering and the particulars of a specific climb to ensure the right gear is obtained. They also need to understand potential hazards such as weather, terrain, and local animal dangers in order to plan what might be needed in an emergency (first aid medicines and supplies, a mode of communication such as a satellite phone, etc.). They would have also need to investigate guides to find the right match for the climb, plan and buy supplies for hydration and nutrition that are tailored for climbers, stay within a pack weight ratio and manage a budget. Without first understanding what climbing is like and what factors into a climbing expedition, planning properly would be difficult and mistakes could put participants at risk.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Scenarios Where this Skill Might be Useful</b></span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Tactical organization, when one must plan a single attack, prepare for war or defend one&#8217;s home and resources</li>
<li>Planning an escape, when success depends on minimizing as much danger as possible</li>
<li>Preparing one&#8217;s resources for survival (understanding how many pounds of meat is needed to survive the winter, or being prepared to take advantage of opportunities such as collecting rainfall, harvesting grain or vegetables at an optimal time) and then storing it effectively</li>
<li>Managing money or resources</li>
<li>Climbing the ladder at one&#8217;s workplace and being a go-getter</li>
<li>Delegating jobs to people who one is in part responsible for, in order to give them hope when it is lost, make them feel valued or needed, or to collectively achieve a goal for the betterment of all</li>
<li>In a leadership role, or any position that one has authority and responsibility</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="triberr_endorsement"></div><p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">You know what I find interesting? That statistic claiming that more people are afraid of public speaking than of anything else in the world. I mean, the everyday person would rather be trapped in a cave, touch a spider, or be chased by clowns than address a crowd. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">But in today&#8217;s market, visibility is huge. Somewhere between 600,000 and 1 million books were self-published last year IN THE US ALONE. For readers to know about our books, we&#8217;ve got to get out there and be seen. And that means book signings, school visits, library engagements, speaking at conferences, etc. If the mere thought makes you break out in hives, take a deep breath, because Rachel Amphlett is here to share 3 simple tips for surviving any public speaking event. IT CAN BE DONE, PEOPLE!</span></em></p>
<div id="attachment_11171" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ter-burg/5807870061/in/photolist-6A9jW1-7Z2cqT-g6qJeW-74nJta-762KYT-5pe4Ph-bUVsVh-766Fij-6FiSCR-fcE8fe-7d1Kcz-9RdRqH-psgDFg-9Rbkn8-9RebsL-9Reaid-9RebTW-7kadjF-9EWrFd-fcUr79-av1aCV-9Rejuu-cMkRJo-9j7nKd-51oerJ-9djzvy-9RebHS-766Dxy-9Reujp-7nsca2-6KkHqH-7faEfj-7nw7CQ-4W16E6-g6qnA2-fcUr8L-6FiSGD-51oeo9-9K9QSZ-766EhE-fAtnCr-766HRE-7aAHov-7oLzus-9aosJy-fcE8ba-cMkQ6y-754xeL-egtPjA-x5oBy"><img class="wp-image-11171 size-medium" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/5807870061_8c95c6ccbb_b-300x200.jpg" alt="Creative Company Conference 2011" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sebastiaan ter Burg @ Creative Commons</p></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Most writers I know, myself included, are quite happy in their own little worlds. We might venture out to go to work, socialize with friends, or do the shopping but we’re never happier than when we’re tucked away daydreaming or scribbling down frantic notes for our current works in progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The problem is, when we are required to do public speaking, we’re simply not equipped for it. In fact, we’re terrified. So, how do you go from happy introvert to confident extrovert, even if it’s just for a few minutes?</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">Prepare Yourself</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">You’re probably going to be asked to read an excerpt from your latest work. The trick here is to read it out aloud on your own a couple of times during the week leading up to the event.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Talking out loud is a lot different to talking in your head. You’ll spot the words you’re likely to trip over, you’ll discover a whole new meaning to ‘pacing’ and, more importantly, you’ll find the places where you can come up for air.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Yes, remember to breathe – please. We don’t want you passing out from lack of air.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">Know Your Audience</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The first public talk I ever did with regard to my writing was in a library, on a Saturday morning, to two people. Yes, two.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I was still scared. These lovely ladies had read about my first novel in the local paper and had decided that they’d better come along to see what I had to say for myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I quickly realised it would be ridiculous if I insisted on standing and pacing about in front of them, so instead we pulled up a little circle of chairs and I started off by explaining how I decided to write a book. Before I knew it, a whole hour had gone by, two of the library employees had joined us, and they’d all grabbed details of how to download my book (it was only available as an eBook at the time, and the library still supported me, thank goodness), and we’ve exchanged emails since that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Sitting down and being at the same level as my audience meant we were a lot more approachable to each other – the gesture broke down any ‘us and them’ barriers that might have otherwise been in place, and led to a much better engagement. And I realized that they weren’t so scary after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The key here is to size up your audience and adjust your presentation, if necessary. Are the guests talkative and chatty? Engage them with questions. Are people taking lots of notes? Slow down the tiniest bit to allow them time to write. Reading your audience is hugely helpful in allowing you to tailor your presentation to their needs, which can make for a more successful event.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">Take Your Time</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For the life of me, I can’t remember where I learnt this trick, but trust me – it works. Whatever the occasion, when it’s your turn to stand up in front of an audience, make them wait.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Not too long, though. By taking your time, I mean walk up to the podium, stage or whatever speaking platform has been set up, and either open the book and run your gaze over the first few sentences, or adjust the microphone. Adjusting the microphone is my favorite trick. Personally, I haven’t got an excuse, because at six foot tall I usually tower over my host anyway, but it’s a fantastic way to prepare for public speaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When I was asked to read an excerpt from my first book at an international thriller author’s book launch, I adjusted the microphone, looked up at the audience, and asked if they could hear me okay. A few people at the back called out that they could, and off I went. Those precious few seconds allowed me to:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">• Get my breathing under control</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> • Eyeball my audience</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> • Engage with my audience, and prepare them (and me!) for the sound of my voice</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Hopefully the above tips will help ease your nerves leading up to your moment in the spotlight. If public speaking is something you’d like to develop, there are several groups you can join, <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org" target="_blank">Toastmasters</a> being the obvious choice, and one I’ve participated in a couple of times. I found them to be incredibly supportive and attentive listeners and the feedback is invaluable. Often, the hurdle is getting used to your own voice, but once you’ve done that, you’ll be well on your way to being a confident public speaker, even if it’s just for a few minutes.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Required Resources and Training</b></span>: Whittling is a time-consuming activity that takes much practice to master. It can be learned with little or no teaching; all you really need is a sharp knife, a piece of wood, and lots of time. It helps to have a basic understanding of wood types, so you can choose the type of wood that will yield the best result for the project. And while you can whittle with any knife, smaller ones work best, and different kinds of blades can help with different cuts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Associated Stereotypes and Perceptions</b></span>: The most common stereotype associated with whittling is the country bumpkin (usually male) sitting on the front porch whittling sticks down to toothpicks. While it makes sense that an avid whittler needs access to wood, he doesn&#8217;t have to live <em>in</em> the actual woods. Items can be whittled from wood chunks or twigs found in a park, or even from lumber bought at a hardware store.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Scenarios Where this Skill Might be Useful</b></span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">for relaxation or stress relief</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">as a way of passing the time when one has excess time on one&#8217;s hands</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">coming up with a new product or technique that can be turned into a much-needed money-making venture for the hero</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">when a small, secretive item is needed to help save the day (a lock pick, wooden coin, weapon, etc.)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">when it&#8217;s necessary to camouflage something important as an everyday object</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Stories Where Whittling is Used As Part of the Plot Line</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Shawshank Redemption—though Andy Dufresne whittled soapstone instead of wood</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Spindle&#8217;s End (Robin McKinley)</span></li>

<p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">So, I mentioned that November is insane, right? My son&#8217;s birthday falls just before Thanksgiving. This year, we&#8217;re throwing his first party. He wanted a Darth Vader theme, and I may have gone a teensy bit overboard. Regardless, his birthday party, combined with his actual birthday, followed by my father-in-law&#8217;s birthday, and then Thanksgiving for the family at MY HOUSE THIS YEAR&#8230; Well. Let&#8217;s just say that it&#8217;s all about planning and pacing right now. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Advice that is so often true of writing, too.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">And I just happen to have this nifty post on the subject, which originally aired at <a href="http://lisahallwilson.com" target="_blank">Lisa Hall-Wilson&#8217;s excellent blog</a>. So, in homage to the difficult topic of pacing, and in an effort to maintain my natural hair color through yet another November, here it is, for your viewing pleasure&#8230;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I’d like to start this post by stating an opinion that I think pretty much everyone shares: Pacing Sucks. When you get it right, no one really notices. I mean, how many times have you read a 5-star review that went on and on about <em>the awesome pacing</em>? On the other hand, when the pacing’s off, it’s obvious, but not always easy to pinpoint; you’re just left with this vague, ghostly feeling of dissatisfaction. One thing, though, is certain: if the pacing is wrong, it’s definitely going to bother your readers, so I thought I’d share some tips on how to keep the pace smooth and balanced.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">1. Current Story vs. Backstory</span>. </strong>Every character and every story has backstory. But the relaying of this information almost always slows the pace because it pulls the reader out of the current story and plops them into another one. It’s disorienting. And yet, a certain amount of backstory is necessary to create depth in regards to characters and plot. To keep the pace moving, only share what’s necessary for the reader to know <em>at that moment</em>. Dole out the history in small pieces within the context of the current story, and avoid narrative stretches that interrupt what’s going on. Here’s a great example from <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JOPE4C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007JOPE4C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theboomus06-20&amp;linkId=HUCY2PWK25CKUNEP">Above</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theboomus06-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B007JOPE4C" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></em>, by Leah Bobet:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>The only good thing about my Curse is that I can still Pass. And that’s half enough to keep me out of trouble. But tonight it’s not the half I need because here’s Atticus, spindly crab arms folded ‘cross his chest, waiting outside my door. His eyes glow dim-shot amber—not bright, so he’s not mad, just annoyed and looking to be mad.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Bobet could have taken a lengthy paragraph to explain that certain people in this world have curses that are really mutations, that Atticus has crab claws for hands and his eyes glow when he gets angry. But that would’ve slowed the pace and been boring. Instead, Bobet wove this information into the current story—showed Atticus leaning against the door, showed his crustacean claws and his freaky, glowing eyes so the reader knows that he’s a mutant and, to the narrator, at least, this is normal. This is an excellent example of the artful weaving of backstory into the present story.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2. Action vs. Exposition/Internal Dialogue</strong></span>. Action is an accelerant. It keeps the pace from dragging. Granted, there will be places in your story that are inherently passive, where characters have to talk, or someone needs to think things out. The key is to break up these places with movement or activity. Characters should be in motion—smacking gum or doodling or fidgeting— while talking. Give them something to do during their thoughtful moments, whether it’s peeling carrots or painting a picture. These bits of action are like an optical illusion, fooling the reader into thinking something’s happening, when really, nothing’s going on. This is one scenario when readers actually prefer to be fooled, so make sure to energize those narrative stretches with action.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_11237" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverkendal/3777040907/in/photolist-iA85Qv-ecoKvz-dKFtiW-sNWah-miY647-nfCtXm-nLTgew-hqEThK-f4CmAk-mK3cj-2oGh5-7JySjU-f52Qbr-9wETUk-kNKiEE-6c7xWe-6KLjEX-dAem4y-ixfwmV-ixuWDY-cAStGJ-evw7vf-ya2vh-5RHSqv-4xNL4-afpFU-89Knqy-cgs77-pFhpMu-e8bzr1-mhUeUY-py925K-jcGS9x-go95H4-5FeLfu-6HDdUJ-aLUJ4c-pp2Mq5-kDLip2-ib9oJG-6zrQL2-e1pNmi-8Z3V1-6ngZpb-D7aSS-cxTKLJ-nz5BxB-ixJ6RZ-5WwvTN-7WGWq3"><img class="wp-image-11237 size-medium" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3777040907_c7610fb2d5_o-300x200.jpg" alt="3777040907_c7610fb2d5_o" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Oliver Kendal @ Creative Commons</p></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3. Conflict vs. Downtime</strong></span>. On the flip side, you can’t have a story that’s all go and no stop. One might think that since action is good, more action is better. Not true. Readers need time to catch their breath, to recover from highly emotional or stressful scenes. A good pace is one that ebbs and flows—high action, a bit of recovery, then back to the activity again. Even <span style="color: #339966;"><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QE3CTY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QE3CTY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theboomus06-20&amp;linkId=2IG4LJI3M2O5DGFW">The Maze Runner</a></em></span>, possibly the most active novel I’ve ever read, has its moments of calm. When it comes to conflict and downtime, a definite balance is needed for the reader to feel satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4. Keep Upping the Stakes</strong></span>. We know that conflict is important—so important that every single scene needs it. But for conflict to be effective, it needs to escalate over the course of the story. To keep the reader engaged, each of the major conflict points needs to be bigger, more dramatic, and with stakes that are more desperate. One of my favorite reads of 2013 was Ruta Sepetys’ <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H4XCTQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004H4XCTQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theboomus06-20&amp;linkId=TEOJZCXPEJ6KWUZD">Between Shades of Gray</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theboomus06-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004H4XCTQ" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></em>, a historical fiction novel about the deportation of a Lithuanian family during World War II. It starts out ominous enough, with the family being forced from their home. Over the course of the story, they’re moved by cattle car across the continent, relocated to a forced labor camp, and eventually reach their final destination—a camp in the Arctic Circle where they’re expected to survive the elements with whatever resources they can scrounge. Clearly, lots of other conflict is interspersed, but when it comes to the major points, each one should have greater impact than the last.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>5. Condense the timeline</strong></span>. When possible, keep your timeline tight. If it gets too spread out, the story will inevitably drag. It’s also hard, in a story that covers a long span, to keep things smooth; there will be time jumps of weeks or months or even years between scenes. Too many of these give the story a jerky feel. So when it comes to the timeline, condense it as much as possible to keep the pace steady.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For sure, pacing is tricky, but I’ve found these nuggets to be helpful in maintaining a good balance. What other tips do you have for keeping your story moving at the right pace?</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="triberr_endorsement"></div><p><b>As writers, we want to make our characters as unique and interesting as possible. One way to do this is to give your character a special skill or talent that sets him apart from other people. This might be something small, like having a green thumb or being good with animals, to a larger and more competitive talent like stock car racing or being an award-winning film producer. </b><br />
<b><br />
</b><b>When choosing a talent or skill, think about the personality of your character, his range of experiences and who his role models might have been. Some talents might be genetically imparted while others are created through exposure (such as a character talented at fixing watches from growing up in his father’s watch shop) or grow out of interest (archery, wakeboarding, or magic). Don’t be afraid to be creative and make sure the skill or talent is something that works with the scope of the story. </b></p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/astrology.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-11153 size-medium" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/astrology-300x298.jpg" alt="astrology" width="300" height="298" /></a> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Description</b></span>: exploring the study of the placement of stars, planets and constellations, to determine how astrological structure can affect personality and influence life events. A character who has studied astrology extensively can chart an individual&#8217;s celestial path by using the date and hour of their birth. This information can offer unique insight into their personality traits, relationships, and how certain planetary movements may be influencing their lives. This in turn can give greater context to past events, the present, and possibly open a window into what the future may hold.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Beneficial Strengths or Abilities</b></span>: Strong reading skills, a background in psychology or working knowledge of the personality basics, being a people-person, having an investigative nature, a willingness to help others, an interest in other cultures and their beliefs, being strong in mathematics<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://writershelpingwriters.net/2010/10/character-traits-thesaurus-collection/">Character Traits</a><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;"> Suited for this Skill or Talent</span></span></b><span style="color: #000000;">: open-mindedness, studious, intelligence, pensive, inquisitive, disciplined, patience, curiosity<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Required Resources and Training</b></span>: A character would have to dedicate significant amounts of time to the study of the stars, constellations (birth signs), cultural mythology (pertaining to astrological beliefs), and spiritual beliefs. Having a mentor or attending programs that focus on astrology and its teachings would fast track one&#8217;s knowledge. The character would also need significant practical experience in creating charts and learning the right questions to ask so that one&#8217;s advice addresses the specific areas the subject will find the most useful.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Associated Stereotypes and Perceptions</b></span>:</span></p>
<p>Many believe that astrology is not a valid discipline, while others place weight on what celestial influences are interacting with their star/sun sign at different points of their lives. Most see astrology as being no more than computer generated horoscopes that run in newspapers and magazines, but in reality, it is a philosophical study of finding meaning in the stars.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Scenarios Where This Skill Could be Useful:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Choosing the right time to have a family, take financial risks or make bigger changes in one&#8217;s life by seeing if the influences in the stars are currently favorable or not</li>
<li>Understanding the traits that pair with Zodiac signs to determine if a friendship or other relationship will be a strong match, and if not, how best to work with a specific sign based on the traits that present typically with someone of that group</li>
<li>Increase awareness of upcoming planetary shifts that may present challenges, so one can work towards minimizing them before they occur</li>
<li>As a form of entertainment at parties</li>
<li>As a way to secure one&#8217;s place as an adviser or trusted supporter (provided the person in power believes in Astrological influences)</li>
<li>As a method to introduce a fictional prophesy or predict a major event</li>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">First let me start by giving a heartfelt THANK YOU to the men and women who have served or currently do serve in the armed forces. While Veteran&#8217;s Day is an American holiday, I applaud and respect the dedication it takes for anyone to serve their country in such a sacrificial way. I recognize that my freedom comes at great cost, and I&#8217;m humbly and eternally grateful for your sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">One of the freedoms we cherish in America is the ability to choose our own career paths—even if our desired career is difficult or impractical or monetarily unfruitful. (How&#8217;s that for a nice way to say MAKES YOU POOR?) Writing is a tough business in a lot of ways. It&#8217;s particularly hard to make as much money as we&#8217;d like (especially in the early years), which is why so many of us have day jobs. I know most of us wish we could have a job within the writing field, since we&#8217;d like to earn money doing what we love, so when Brenda Di Bella contacted us with a potential post about technical writing, I jumped at the chance. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Back in college, I took a summer temp position at Harcourt-Brace, where I did some technical writing. I loved the writing aspect of that job. It&#8217;s a great option for writers of all stripes, so if you&#8217;re looking for a full-time opportunity or simply a way to supplement your income, check out what Bella has to say about this career option for writers&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why Technical Writing?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Technical writing can be an excellent source of income for all writers. There are thousands of opportunities out there for individuals with writing skills, and many of them are remote projects that can be done from home. You don’t have to be a technical expert to earn extra income in this lucrative and flexible field. In fact, because most “uber-techie” types are notoriously atrocious writers, the demand for skilled communicators is very high and continues to grow as technology evolves.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> While many people (like myself) have chosen tech writing as a full-time career, many projects are available on a contract basis, making them temporary commitments with a lot of flexibility. Currently, the average hourly rate for technical writers in the U.S. is $31. This rate varies based on skill level, location, industry, and other factors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What is it?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Technical writers are responsible for converting complicated technical and scientific information into language that is easy to understand. They usually work in conjunction with computer programmers, engineers, medical professionals, or other specialized experts. Just about every industry imaginable has the need for technical writers at some point in time. While an exhaustive list of the types of projects available would be far too lengthy for this blog, some common projects include:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> • user guides, manuals, online help, and training materials</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> • design and marketing specifications</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> • research articles and reports</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> • policy and procedure documents</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What Qualifications or Skills are Necessary?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Along with grammar skills, a successful technical writer must have a knack for clarity. The ability to consider the technical savvy of your audience is essential for this type of work. For example, when writing a user guide for a new software application, it is important to include every step necessary to perform a task. Likewise, policy and procedure manuals must be worded very carefully to avoid possible issues for the employer.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Some computer proficiency is necessary for most tech writing projects. The most commonly used applications for this type of work are Microsoft Word, FrameMaker, RoboHelp, and XML. In some cases, research and training skills may be required.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The qualifications necessary to acquire tech writing projects vary, but most clients prefer candidates with some education in English (or a similar field of study) and some writing experience. It is a good idea to develop a portfolio of writing samples to show off your abilities. Some resources for strengthening your skill set and learning about trends in the field are:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> • The Society for Technical Communication (STC) – be sure to check out their webinars!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> • The National Association of Science Writers</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> • The National Writers’ Association</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> • The National Writers’ Union</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Where Do I Find More Info?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thousands of tech writing opportunities can be found every day on all the popular employment websites (Monster, CareerBuilder, Indeed, etc.). In addition to these, be sure to check out Dice.com (which specializes in tech jobs), the STC website, and the job placement department of your alma mater. I mention these resources in particular because I have had personal success with each of them. There are also a plethora of sites specifically dedicated to tech writing jobs. These might very well be viable resources for opportunities, but be cautious about any which require you to pay for their services, and don’t expect to be flooded with offers. Finally, many companies do not use employment sites to post job openings, but a quick visit to their corporate website can tell you if they are looking for someone like you.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="triberr_endorsement"></div><p><b>As writers, we want to make our characters as unique and interesting as possible. One way to do this is to give your character a special skill or talent that sets him apart from other people. This might be something small, like having a green thumb or being good with animals, to a larger and more competitive talent like stock car racing or being an award-winning film producer. </b><br />
<b><br />
</b><b>When choosing a talent or skill, think about the personality of your character, his range of experiences and who his role models might have been. Some talents might be genetically imparted while others are created through exposure (such as a character talented at fixing watches from growing up in his father’s watch shop) or grow out of interest (archery, wakeboarding, or magic). Don’t be afraid to be creative and make sure the skill or talent is something that works with the scope of the story. </b></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>THROWING ONE&#8217;S VOICE </strong><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ventriloquist.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11109 " src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ventriloquist.jpg" alt="ventriloquist" width="513" height="385" /></a></h2>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Description</b></span><span style="color: #000000;">: also known as ventriloquism; the ability to change one&#8217;s voice to make it appear to be coming from someone or somewhere else</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Interesting</b> <strong>Origins</strong></span>: This ability was originally involved in religious practices. Ancient Greeks believed that the noises that came from one&#8217;s stomach were the voices of the unliving, who took up residence there. The ventriloquist was the interpreter of these voices, and so was believed to be able to converse with the dead and to foretell the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Beneficial</strong><b> Strengths or Abilities</b></span>: strong core muscles to enable one to breath correctly, good acting chops (since successfully throwing one&#8217;s voice relies heavily on listener perception)</span></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://writershelpingwriters.net/2010/10/character-traits-thesaurus-collection/">Character Traits</a><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;"> Suited for this Skill or Talent</span></span></b><span style="color: #000000;">: disciplined, dedicated, sneaky, manipulative, dramatic, playful</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Required Resources and Training</b></span>: Throwing the voice requires utilizing the right muscles throughout the body, changing the way one typically would speak (via placement of the tongue, lips, etc.), and placing the voice in a different area of the throat than is normally used when talking. Basically, this ability requires learning to speak in a whole new way. It requires study, discipline, and lots and lots of practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Associated Stereotypes and Perceptions</b></span>: ventriloquists; fortune tellers and other scammers</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Scenarios Where this Skill Might be Useful</b></span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>when one needs to escape or throw an enemy off of one&#8217;s trail</li>
<li>to provide a distraction</li>
<li>to scare someone</li>
<li>to discredit or embarrass someone (by making people think that person is saying something he/she wouldn&#8217;t normally say)</li>
<li>to trap someone (by getting them to follow the sound of one&#8217;s voice)</li>
<li>for entertainment purposes</li>
