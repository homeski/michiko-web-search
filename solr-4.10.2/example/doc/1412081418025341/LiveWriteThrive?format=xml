				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">There seems to be some confusion over the words <em>alternate</em> and <em>alternative</em>. Can they be used interchangeably? Does <em>alternative</em> involve only two choices? The confusion is understandable since both words serve multiple parts of speech.</p>
<p><em>Alternate</em> can be a verb, noun, or adjective. When used as a verb, the last syllable is accented and the final <em>a</em> is long.</p>
<ul>
<li>Verb: Joan and I alternated sitting in the front seat to keep our motion sickness under control. (Meaning: took turns)</li>
<li>Noun: The alternates to the political convention were vocal in their opposition to platform’s taxation plank. (Meaning: substitutes)</li>
<li>Adjective: We took an alternate route to the museum due to construction.(Meaning: another option/choice)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Alternative</em> can be a noun or an adjective.</p>
<ul>
<li>Noun: My morning alternative to coffee is a headache. (Meaning: a choice—caffeine or headache)</li>
<li>Adjective: <em>Lolapalooza</em> began as a showcase for alternative bands in the early 1990s. (Meaning: another choice, option)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some argue that <em>alternative</em> refers only to two choices. Such reasoning is a logical progression from the word’s Latin root <em>alter</em>, meaning “the other of two.” But there is nearly universal agreement that <em>alternative</em> can refer to multiple options. Both <em>Merriam-Webster</em> and the <em>American Heritage Dictionary</em> define <em>alternative</em> as involving two or more choices. So writing “The alternatives available to a Starbuck’s customer are limitless” is correct, if not overwhelming.</p>

My blog is a labor of love for all writers striving to write the best books possible! I&#8217;m grateful.</i></p>
<p>Hard to believe we are now about to examine the twelfth and final <a title="Novel Construction 101" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/01/01/novel-construction-101/">pillar of construction</a>—motifs. We’ve spent the whole year taking a long, hard look at what’s needed to support a weighty story, and I hope by now you’ve used the inspection checklists (at the bottom of each post) to analyze every aspect of your novel to make sure it’s built with solid, enduring materials.<span id="more-6196"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Glue and Superglue</h2>
<p>You may wonder why I consider motifs an important pillar of novel support. Surely not every novel in every genre needs to contain a motif (or two or five), but motifs can supercharge your story, and it’s very likely that if you add some, you can make your novel more interesting and memorable. I noted earlier that <a title="Themes That Develop Organically in Your Novel" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/05/14/themes-that-develop-organically-in-your-novel/">themes are the glue</a> that bind the elements of your novel. Well, motifs are like Superglue. A little goes a long way.</p>
<p>Motifs can make the difference between an okay story and a terrific one. Novels that present powerful motifs reach readers on multiple levels, for we humans resonate with symbols, and although a motif isn’t strictly (or always) a symbol of some sort, a motif carries symbolic import to some extent.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Symbolism Is at the Heart of Culture</h2>
<p>Cultures from the dawn of time have utilized symbols, and in many cultures these symbols are not only foundational, they contain deep meaning and often are used to instruct and define their society. I don’t mean to go into a history lesson, for I’m sure you understand what I’m talking about. Motifs and symbols, in other words, can reach us on deep, primal, unconscious levels.</p>
<p>Is that a good thing? I believe it is. If you followed this blog in 2012 or have read through the posts from the section Writing the Heart of Your Story (or have studied <a title="Writing the Heart of Your Story on Kindle" href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Heart-Your-Story-Unforgettable-ebook/dp/B00L9CJQIU/" target="_blank">the book</a>), you’ll know I’m all about reaching not just the heart of your story but your own heart and the heart of the reader. To me, a novel is a bridge from one heart to another—the writer’s to the reader’s. Motifs are an element you can use in constructing your novel so that you create that bridge.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Difference between Motif and Theme</h2>
<p>Let’s first make the distinction between theme and motif, since we’ve already looked at what theme is and its importance in your novel. Theme is so important, it’s one of the <a title="Revisiting the Four Primary Pillars of Novel Construction" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/06/04/revisiting-the-four-primary-pillars-of-novel-construction/" target="_blank">four corner support pillars </a>of any story, and your novel may have a number of themes weaving through that also work to tie all your elements together.</p>
<p>Your novel may explore themes like bigotry, greed, revenge, or forgiveness, and the plot and characters embody and showcase these themes to get across your “take-home” message for your book (if you have one). Theme is what your book “is really about.” (If you haven’t taken the time to read the posts on theme for this course on novel construction, start with <a title="Theme—What’s at the Heart of Your Story" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/04/30/theme-whats-at-the-heart-of-your-story/" target="_blank">this one here</a>.) But a theme is not a motif.</p>
<p>Merriam-Webster’s defines motif this way: “A usually recurring salient thematic element (as in the arts);  especially a dominant idea or central theme.” For our purposes, for ease of understanding and application, I prefer to leave <em>theme</em> out of this definition, treating it as a separate entity altogether. But the key to motif is in those two words: <em>recurring</em> and <em>salient.</em> (<em>Salient</em> meaning something that juts out, rises above, projects significantly or conspicuously.)</p>
<p>Motifs are symbolic elements packed with inference. Motifs can be a “thing”—some object that makes a repeated appearance in your novel. Or they can be word or phrase, a concept, an image—just about anything that can be repeated with significance and symbolism. The weather can be a motif, for example, if each time something terrible is about to happen, “lightning” strikes.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Image Systems for Your Novels</h2>
<p>In last year’s course on this blog—Shoot Your Novel—I spoke at length about <a title="How Novelists Can Create Image Systems for their Story" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2013/10/16/how-novelists-can-create-image-systems-for-their-story/" target="_blank">image systems</a> that filmmakers utilize to give this kind of depth and cohesion to a film. Without reiterating too much, an image system comprises specific images, colors, phrases, symbols—essentially motifs—among many other things. Books like <em>The Bluest Eye </em>(Toni Morrison) and <em>Riders of the Purple Sage</em> (Zane Grey) used a specific color repeatedly as a motif (not hard to guess which color, right? Bringing your motif into your title, as you can see, adds that powerful and memorable cohesion to the story).</p>
<p>I mentioned various movies in those posts that brought motifs into play, such as the element of water in <em>What Lies Beneath</em>, the play and mention of light in <em>K-Pax</em>, and the fairy tale elements in <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>. Great storytellers will spend time thinking of motifs they can infuse into their story to give it greater depth.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Repetition Is the Key</h2>
<p>Repetition, as we all know, is what helps us remember. My psychology professor in college said that if you repeat something (like a person’s name) aloud seven times in a short amount of time (such as in conversation), that word or phrase will transfer from the part of the brain that stores short-term memory to the part that stores long-term memory (or something like that. I learned this a lot of years ago and, sadly, I did not repeat his exact words seven times aloud to ensure I remembered it correctly!).</p>
<p>But I hope you get my point here. If you use a motif in your book repeatedly, readers are going to notice, and when they recall your book months later, often those motifs will be the main things they do remember. At least that’s how I am. When I think of Leif Enger’s novel <em>Peace Like a River</em>, the first thing that comes to mind is the repeated phrase that serves as a powerful motif in his story—his character young Reuben Land saying, essentially, “This is what I saw. This is what I heard. Make of it what you will.”</p>
<p>In <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> the motif of birds is reiterated in not just words but conceptually. A bird is used in the title, drawn from a key line in the story that serves as the theme—about mockingbirds being harmless and so shouldn’t be harmed. In addition, the key character’s name is Finch—which is the name of a very small bird (which might seem to be incapable of putting up a big fight against a huge, vicious bird [read: racism]).</p>
<p>The mockingbird is a symbol that glues Harper Lee’s story together, just as the <em>mockingjay</em> is a symbol used very literally in <em>The Hunger Games­</em>—as the main character, Katniss,who is given the label &#8220;The Mockingjay&#8221;—uses the call of the mockingjay, and is given a mockingjay pin to wear, which has rebellion written all over it. Even the trailers for the movies use the short mockingjay whistle-call as an identifier for the films.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Name That Tune</h2>
<p>How many of us repeated the musical pattern that was a key element in communicating with aliens in <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em>? I still can hum it after decades. Why? Because it was used as a motif repeatedly through the movie (and is a main element of the plot). Sorry if I reminded you about this—it will probably be stuck now in your head for days.</p>
<p>So you can see that a motif can be many things, even a few musical notes. Although it’s probably not going to be all that effective to describe a musical ditty in your novel, you have plenty of other ways to present motifs via the printed word.</p>
<p>Do you see how powerful a motif is? Do you want readers to remember your novel years—maybe even decades—from now? One way (in addition to writing a terrific story that has all the other eleven pillars constructed well) is to use motifs.</p>
<p>We’ll explore this last pillar of novel construction further in next week’s post.</p>
<p>What motifs in a novel or film immediately come to your mind? Do you have one special motif you are using in your novel? If not, can you think of one that will tie in with your theme and help form an image system for your story?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today&#8217;s guest post is by author Rachel Amphlett:</em></p>
<p>If there’s one bit of writing advice that riles me, it’s the old adage “write what you know.”</p>
<p>It’s just <em>wrong</em>, especially when handed out to new writers.</p>
<p>Sure, writing what you know is all very well if you’re an ex-serving member of the military, or a cop, a secret agent, or even a cowboy—you have a wealth of exciting knowledge at your fingertips. But what if you can’t draw from an intriguing, exciting vocation?<span id="more-6061"></span></p>
<p>What if your daytime role is that of a harassed secretary, a gas station attendant, or a bus driver, but you want to write regency romance, or a thriller, or a crime series?</p>
<p>How do you get from your day job to damsel in distress, reluctant hero, explosives expert, FBI agent, or rural police detective?</p>
<p>Research, that’s how. And it doesn’t have to cost you a fortune in money or time. Back in the day, a writer might have traveled far and wide to do the needed research in order to write a novel packed with accurate details. But in today’s world, writers have access to some cost-effective ways within reach to get started.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of my suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local Newspapers: </strong>Local newspapers these days are often accessible online. These provide a superb way to get a good indicator of community concerns, seasonal conditions (and how they affect your locale of choice), types of employment common in their region (mining, agriculture, automotive industries), and crime rates.</li>
<li><strong>Photographs: </strong>If you can’t afford to travel, do you know someone who has been there or lived there who can answer your questions? Maybe they will share their holiday photos with you, and share their impressions of the place and people.</li>
<li><strong>Pinterest</strong> is a great place to look for inspiration. You can set up a “pin board” for your writing projects, search the photograph database by subject, and “pin” anything that catches your eye. Pin boards can be saved as “public” or “private.” You can then go back through the photographs if you’re struggling to describe a scene. Mix in a bit of imagination, and off you go.</li>
<li><strong>Travel Guides: </strong>These are great because not only do you gain some historical information about your chosen locale, you’ll get access to maps, details of public transport routes, cafes, restaurants, live music venues, and accommodation options. A guidebook will often contain details of a city’s “must avoid” areas—which of course, you’ll be sending your protagonist into while he is chasing or escaping from the bad guys, right?</li>
<li><strong>Experts: </strong>Start off by asking your own doctor—you’ll be amazed at how eager people will be to help you if you ask. If you need information about any of the emergency services, start off by contacting their media unit. Explain what you’re doing, give them some context, and be specific with your questions.</li>
<li><strong>Check the media relations pages</strong> of your local emergency services websites. There will often be public open days you can attend.</li>
<li><strong>Finally, watch for career expos</strong> that cover a wide range of skills and roles. These are great events where you can wander around for inspiration and make contact. Take some business cards along with you, introduce yourself, and ask if you can e-mail or phone these professionals for help with your research. You’ll be surprised how eager people are to get involved to make sure you get your facts right.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Online Information</h2>
<p>There’s a tremendous amount of information available online. Here is a selection of some of my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a title="FBI website" href="http://www.fbi.gov/" target="_blank">FBI</a>: </strong>Any national security service has an enormous task in protecting its citizens, and the FBI is listed here because it provides information about what it does in a very practical and accessible way.</li>
<li><strong><a title="BBC Magazine" href="www.bbc.co.uk/magazine" target="_blank">BBC Magazine</a>:</strong>: I’m a news junkie, and I love the BBC Magazine site because it offers a vast range of articles on everything from archaeology to zoology. The problem is, you’ll find yourself getting distracted very easily as there is so much good information here, so be prepared to have your Favorites folder on standby to save all those new story ideas!</li>
<li><strong><a title="Forensics for Fiction" href="http://forensics4fiction.com/" target="_blank">Forensics for Fiction</a>: </strong>Run by thriller author Tom Adair, who has a background in forensics, this website covers everything from firing guns underwater to decomposition rates for your murder victims. Tom is very approachable, so if you have a nagging question about what, why, or how within the forensics field, Tom’s your go-to man.</li>
<li><a title="Geography IQ" href="http://www.geographyiq.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Geography IQ</strong></a>:<em> </em>This website is designed so that you can look up any country and immediately gain access to information on climate, geographic population growth, military setup, historical overview, and economies.</li>
<li><a title="How Stuff Works" href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/" target="_blank"><strong>How Stuff Works</strong></a>:<em> </em>With headings such as Culture, Auto, Science, Tech and Health, this is the place to go to if you’ve ever wondered how something, um, works. Addictive reading—be warned!</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong> Local Sports Clubs</strong></h2>
<p>Want to find out what it’s like to use a bow and arrow? Fire a gun? Have a sword fight? Ride a horse?</p>
<p>Search for local sports clubs. They often have open days and are usually delighted to help. If they don’t have open days, give them a call, explain you’re a local author trying to do some research, and find out if they can offer you an introductory fee to have a lesson or two, or watch a lesson.</p>
<p>Actually, doing the activity that your characters undertake gives you a whole new perspective on what it’s like, and is an immense help—so long as it’s not dangerous, harmful, or destructive! You’ll be surprised what you’ll find once you start looking too. I live in Brisbane, Australia, and there’s even a medieval combat school in my area!</p>
<p>Write what you know?</p>
<p><em>Pah</em>.</p>
<p>Write what you long to write—and have fun learning new things as you dive into research!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;">I sometimes hear or read sentences like “He <em>predominately</em> goes to that Starbuck’s.” That word is a mouthful, and because it sounds so much like </span><em style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;">predominantly</em><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;">, it’s no surprise the words get mixed up.</span></h3>
<p>While the meanings of the two words are nearly identical, there is a rationale for the differentiation.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Predominate</em>: to hold advantage in numbers or quantity; to exert controlling power or influence</li>
<li><em>Predominant</em>: having superior strength, influence or authority; being most frequent or common.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Predominate</em> is best used as a verb, though historically it has also been used as an adjective. <em>Predominant</em>, however, is always used as an adjective. Both words are formed from the root <em>dominate, </em>for which verb and adjective usages are clearer.<span id="more-4897"></span></p>
<p>I trust few of us would stumble over these word choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ranchers’ interests dominate the Western Governors Conference agenda.</li>
<li>The dominant concern of the Western Governors Conference is ranching interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>History is against the critics. <em>Predominate</em> has been recorded as an adjective since 1591. It’s true that <em>predominantly</em> is much more common than <em>predominately</em>, as <em>predominant</em> is than <em>predominate</em>. However, there is no difference in sense between the pairs and the other forms aren’t wrong, just less often preferred alternatives.</p>
<p>When the adverb is called for, <em>predominantly</em> wins out almost every time, even though both <em>predominate</em> and <em>predominant</em> can be turned into adverbs by adding <em>ly</em>. But <em>predominantly</em> predominates in good usage.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In<a title="Important Considerations When Developing Your Writing Style" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/11/12/important-considerations-when-developing-your-writing-style/"> our first post</a> exploring this eleventh pillar of novel construction—Writing Style . . . Concise and Specific—we looked briefly at what is involved with having a specific style. What this means, essentially, is being deliberate about our writing style—choosing certain qualities or characteristics that fit the genre we are writing in. Genre influences the way we construct sentences, paragraphs, and chapters. It influences our word choices and how we stylize inner and outer dialog, and narrative. And it influences our tone.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">More Tips on Being Specific</h2>
<p>Part of fine-tuning your writing style to be specific is making sure it carries the proper tone throughout your book. What is tone? <a title="Watch Your Tone" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2012/05/23/watch-your-tone/">This post here </a>gives an in-depth look at tone, and I encourage you to read it. It will help you understand the difference between the overall tone of your book (which relates very strongly, once again, to genre) and the voices of your characters, as well as their moods.<span id="more-6113"></span></p>
<p>If you are writing a lighthearted comedy, your tone conveyed by your writing style will be much different from what you would use in a horror novel.</p>
<p>Another consideration when being specific in your style is to determine just how much you want your presence as the author to show through. Tom Robbins (<em>Even Cowgirls Get the Blues</em>) and John Irving (<em>The World According to Garp</em>) are two authors who made a point of “leaking through” their story narrative in a very present (some might say “invasive”) way. That’s their chosen style. I’m a big fan of Kurt Vonnegut’s writing (<em>Cat’s Cradle</em> being one of my all-time favorite novels). He had a snarky, wry style that tainted everything that happened in his novels. You get the sense of these authors’ opinions and beliefs, and that’s intentional.</p>
<p>However, writers who let their personal feelings, opinions, and attitudes come through their prose when it’s not appropriate for their genre, premise, or plot are going to run into trouble. Readers will cry “author intrusion!” and that presence thrust into the story will feel invasive and jarring.</p>
<p>So I hope you have a good feel now for what it means to be specific about a writing style.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Concise Writing Is Mostly about Mechanics</h2>
<p>To have a strong pillar of novel construction, your writing style needs to be concise. There is so much that can be written on this topic that I am taking the entire 2015 year (yes, I am!) to explore it with the help of four great editors who will tackle “The 12 Fatal Flaws of Fiction Writing” (the name of the next online course on this blog).</p>
<p><em>Concise</em> means “brevity of expression or statement; free from all elaboration and superfluous detail” says <em>Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary</em>.  Some synonyms are <em>terse</em>,<em> succinct</em>,<em> laconic</em>,<em> summary</em>,<em> pithy</em>,<em> compendious. </em>As I said in the first post on writing style: “Say what you mean. Don’t say what you don’t mean.” Choose your words carefully and make them count.</p>
<p>Don’t belabor these details in your first draft; just get the writing on the page. But when you begin fine-tuning during your revisions, take the time to cut down clunky writing, choose stronger nouns and verbs, and eliminate repetition. Unless of course you have a <em>specific</em> and deliberate reason for being exceptionally wordy and convoluted—such as when having a pompous and self-absorbed character talk endlessly in circles about practically nothing.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Track Down Those Weasel Words</h2>
<p>Seek and destroy <a title="Pop! Goes the Weasel (Word)" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2012/07/20/pop-goes-the-weasel-word/">weasel words</a>. Those are words you throw in there without thinking, usually due to the way you were taught to speak, and you probably know which ones you tend to use (often an editor or critique partner will point them out). I have a long list of my weasel words, and I often do a Find and Replace in Word in my current draft to seek and destroy them.</p>
<p>Some of these you might use excessively: <em>just, very, began to, started to, rather, up, down</em> (as in “he stood up and then abruptly sat down,” which can usually be written simply as “He stood and then abruptly sat.”).</p>
<p>You can also find adverbs (Find <em>ly</em>) and passive construction (<em>it was, there were, ing</em>) the same way. Changing “she was listening to him as he was relating his story” to “she listened to him while he related his story” is an example of being concise. Good writers know that adverbs can weaken writing, so a great way to make your writing more concise is to search and find those <em>ly</em> words and come up with a better way to show the emotion or action implied. Change “she said angrily” to “she said, with an angry tinge to her voice.” Or just show through action she’s angry. Don’t tell the reader; show it. That’s being concise.</p>
<p>One last tip about being concise: don’t use what’s called “purple prose.” That means avoid packing your paragraphs with fancy $5 words that no one knows. Do you really think your readers want to stop every minute or so and reach for a dictionary? No, they don’t. Again, you might have a braggadocio character that is keen on tossing about eight-syllable arcane words that haven’t been uttered since the Middle Ages. But that’s different from infusing your writing with such words. As the saying goes: “Don’t use a $5 word when a 5¢ word will do.”</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Take the Time to Learn How to Write Well</h2>
<p>This may seem unnecessary to say, but, believe me—it needs to be said. I can’t tell you how many novels I edit and critique that show a dearth of basic language composition skills. Many writers can barely construct a complete sentence or a coherent one. Being a great writer requires learning the language you write in. You need to understand basic grammar, punctuation, and word usage. If you misspell a lot of words and put commas in the wrong places and use words incorrectly, your writing will suffer. I wish I didn’t need to say all this, but I do.</p>
<p>Learn your craft and wield language adeptly. If you need to, take classes at a college and buy (and study) some books on grammar. (Try my book <a title="Say What? on Amazon by C. S. Lakin" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fiction-Writers-Handy-Grammar-Punctuation-ebook/dp/B00I49TO56/" target="_blank"><em>Say What?</em></a> if you really don’t like learning this stuff!) I know, it’s like getting a tooth pulled. But in the long run, you’ll feel much better. Trust me. Writing will come much easier if you learn how to write correctly.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be perfect—that’s why you hire an editor to polish and proofread your manuscript. But the more you can do yourself, the less you will have to rely on an editor to do damage control. And it will cost you less in the long run—in money and time.</p>
<p>So, although I’ve only briefly discussed what concise writing is, I hope you get the gist of it. Have fun developing your unique writing style, tailored to fit your genre, and while you’re at it, take time to improve your grammar, punctuation, and word usage. If you aren’t sure of a word’s meaning, look it up.</p>
<p>That wraps up our look at the eleventh pillar of novel construction, which means you get a new checklist (below)! Only one more pillar to go: Motifs . . . for Cohesion and Depth. We&#8217;re almost done with our course for the year, and I hope you&#8217;ve been going over the checklists and ensuring the pillars that support your novel are strong!</p>
<p>Any thoughts on how to hone your writing style to be concise and unique? What helps you find your style?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today&#8217;s guest blog post is by author and writing instructor Joan Curtis:</em></p>
<p>If you aspire to be a fiction writer and think all you have to do is sit down at your computer and create, you will be very disappointed. Most writers eventually want to publish their work. They want family, friends, and others to read what they&#8217;ve created.</p>
<p>Admittedly, when I wrote my first novel (which I now call my practice novel), my main goal was to see if I could actually write one. That in and of itself is a lofty goal. Once I realized I could write a novel, my next goal was to write a novel that could be published. That led me down a totally different path. I had to learn more about the craft of writing, and I had to learn more about the world of publishing.<span id="more-6017"></span></p>
<p>Over time, I discovered certain things that helped me make inroads in the world of fiction, and they may help you:</p>
<p><strong>1) <em>Enter contests.</em></strong> The first contest I entered was for a nonfiction piece. It was a national contest sponsored by <em>Reader&#8217;s Digest</em> and <em>McCall’s Magazine</em>. I won second place, and I received a note from the editor of <em>Reader&#8217;s Digest</em>. We talked and one year later I published my first written words as an original piece for <em>Reader&#8217;s Digest</em>, receiving more money than any advance on my later books. This experience also built my confidence as a writer.</p>
<p>More on contests: Don’t be shy about entering contests. My cozy mystery won first place in the Malice Domestic Grants award contest for new writers. That boost motivated to keep writing fiction. My nonfiction proposal won first place in the Harriet Austin contest for nonfiction and later became the first of four published business books.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry about winning the contest. Just get your name out there—remember, what you want is exposure. Even the smaller contests are worth entering. My only caution is do not enter contests that cost too much money (none more than $80). Is it worth the cost? Imagine a query letter that begins with &#8220;<em>The Worlds Greatest Novel</em> won first place in the regional mystery writers’ competition.&#8221; That sentence alone separates you from most of the other query letters coming across a publisher&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p><strong>2) <em>Take classes and learn to rewrite.</em></strong> How many times have you heard people say, “I’ve always wanted to write a novel”? Is it really true that everyone has the desire to write a novel? Maybe, but do they have the passion and the discipline?</p>
<p>Even though I thought I could write before I began composing my novels, I quickly saw there was more to fiction writing than I realized. If you are like me and didn&#8217;t major in creative writing in college, you might need to invest some time and energy in studying the craft. I&#8217;ve taken classes on everything from dialogue to plot development. During classes, you will not only meet other writers, you will also have opportunities to personally interact with other people in the industry. For example, I took a class through Writer’s Digest that connected me with the instructor. She became one of my most valuable Beta readers.</p>
<p><strong>3) <em>Go to conferences.</em> </strong>You will meet other writers, as well as agents and editors at conferences. I suggest going to those conferences that offer a one-on-one with an agent or editor. That does not mean that the person you sit down with will sign you. But it does expose you to an agent who will spend anywhere from five to fifteen minutes talking to you. Considering that most of us writers never hear from agents, that exchange could result in  valuable exposure. Furthermore, you will have an opportunity to ask the agent questions.</p>
<p><strong>4) <em>Attend writers’ retreats.</em></strong> At retreats you will have an opportunity to meet established writers who can guide you by sharing their experiences and sometimes offering to share names of people for you to contact. Established writers go to retreats to complete work on their current manuscript or to jumpstart a new writing project. You never know—that chance meeting across the dinner table could mean breaking into the industry. Sometimes even the smallest conversation can be the opportunity you’ve been looking for.</p>
<p><strong>5) <em>Have an Internet presence.</em></strong> Many agents and editors comb the Internet to find new writers. Will they discover you? Do you have an active blog? Have you posted stories on Wattpad? Many writers submit articles to the article banks on the web. Those articles get widespread circulation, and they come up when your name is Googled.</p>
<p><strong>6) <em>Follow other people’s blogs and share comments on them</em>.</strong> Again, the name of the game is to get noticed. When you follow other blogs, you also learn a number of things. Bloggers write about changes in the industry. They blog about new books. They share tips for writers. You will not only learn what is going on, if you do more than “lurk”—simply read and move on—people will remember your name. Be courteous in your comments. Add good content. Your hope is you will attract attention to your own blog and eventually to the publishing industry. [Note: Don’t post comments listing links to your own blog or website; that’s considered spamming or self-promotion, which isn’t good manners when jumping into a blog conversation. ~C. S.]</p>
<p><strong>7) <em>Interview other writers</em></strong> about their publishing journey and their new book—they may return the favor. Whether you publish the interview on your blog, in an article, or on a radio broadcast, you will attract attention. Many writers have started their own radio shows to showcase other writers. Look for those. Reach out.</p>
<p>The goal is to strengthen your platform. You want to attract attention to yourself as a writer and reader. Your platform includes all those people who follow you. You do it through face-to-face networking at conferences and retreats. You do it through the web through blogging, interviewing, radio exposure, article writing, guest posting, commenting, and tweeting. As for tweeting, you want to tweet good content. Retweet other writers. Check out the tweets coming from agents and editors. Follow them.</p>
<p>We writers must get out of our caves and face the world in order for our newly created work to get noticed.</p>
<p>What tips do you have for gaining the attention in the world of fiction?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">A lot of the words we use have changed meaning over time, differing from their common or intended use. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Some words sound so much like other words, they are often used interchangeably, like </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em;">bemused</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> and </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em;">amused.</i><i style="line-height: 1.5em;"> </i><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> </span></p>
<p>Here’s a list of some everyday words that are often misused. See if you are guilty of misunderstanding the true meaning and usage of these words. If you are, don’t feel bad. You’re not alone.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ironic</em>: It doesn’t mean something funny or bad that’s happened to you. It means the occurrence of something opposite to what you expect (although <em>irony</em> has a number of various meanings and applications). An example of an ironic situation: a domestic violence prosecutor being been charged with domestic violence.</li>
<li><em>Irregardless</em>: It’s not a word, sorry. Use <em>regardless. </em>Regardless of what anyone tells you.</li>
<li><em>Peruse</em>: It does not mean to skim or browse over a bit of writing. It means to read something attentively (the opposite). <em>Peruse</em> originally comes from “per use,” which traditionally indicates that you plan to “use up” the text with your passionate reading of it.</li>
<li><em>Consent</em>: It does not mean to give one’s permission or agreement. It means to passively agree, even if you have a negative opinion of what you’re agreeing to. If you consent to something, you’re not cheering it on. You’re allowing it to happen, with your permission.</li>
<li><em>Compelled</em>: It does not mean to voluntarily do something, usually out of a moral or internal impulse. It means to be forced, obligated, or pressured into doing something—the exact opposite of what you think, and there’s an easy way to see how. If you have to give “compulsory service” in the military, that means you don’t have a choice. Compelled comes from “compulsory,” so if you’re “compelled” to give a truthful eye-witness testimony during a court case, that means you gotta do it.</li>
<li><em>Instant</em>: It does not mean very quickly, with lightning speed. Rather, it means a specific point in time. Although we live in an “instant” world and drink “instant” coffee, the popular use of <em>instant</em> commonly diverges from its intended meaning. <em>Instant</em> originally meant a very tiny fraction of time, a moment so minute it was practically infinitesimal. However, the idea of smallness here was carried over to its more common meaning: the small amount of time by which something is done or prepared. Most dictionaries now recognize both uses.</li>
</ul>
<p>I suppose it’s a bit ironic for an editor to encourage the proper use of words when she might feel compelled instantly to consent to her readers to peruse her blog posts on grammar—irregardless of the fatuosity of the task. (No, fatuosity isn’t a real word either.) Hmm  . . . did I just say what I think I said?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often, when learning to write a novel, a writer may spend countless hours focusing on getting all the basics in hand: plot, structure, characters, and all those tricky components that take time to master. Usually writing style is ignored at first, and a writer’s early attempts to just get words on the page are often clunky and/or derivative. And that’s just part of the growing process.</p>
<p>Just as a toddler begins to speak by listening to and imitating the adults who speak to him, a new writer will often try to copy the writing style of other authors. Which is a great thing to do—at first. It’s said “imitation is the best form of flattery,” but it’s also a smart way to learn. By studying and imitating the writing style of great writers in your genre (which we discussed<a title="Important Considerations When Developing Your Writing Style" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/11/12/important-considerations-when-developing-your-writing-style/"> in last week’s post</a>), you can get a feel for how to write your stories.<span id="more-6106"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Emulation Is Fine for a Time</h2>
<p>But at some point, you will have to let go of your tightly gripping hand and cross the street by yourself. There is probably no magic moment in which you suddenly have your own writing style, but I can recall many moments when I felt my unique way of writing beginning to emerge. I started taking chances, letting my imagination wander freely. I shut off the infernal internal editor and knocked the writing instructor off my shoulder and experimented.</p>
<p>More and more moments came to me in which I was writing freely with my own flair, unhindered and unburdened by all the “supposed tos” that were nagging me from the bleachers. I think by about my fifth novel I hit my stride. It was during the writing of <em>The Map across Time</em> that I felt I had found my writing style. I was in my groove. I had settled happily and comfortably into my writing style. And the cool thing was,  it carried over into all my subsequent novels of various genres.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">It’s Just a Learning Curve</h2>
<p>This process is not all that dissimilar to learning to dance or do gymnastics or play basketball. There is a huge learning curve at first, but with diligence and a measure of talent and ability, you “get the hang of it.”</p>
<p>Note, though, this is not something you get and then are stuck with. It’s not like the birth of a baby, which, when it’s born, you don’t get to send back and revise. Your writing style is fluid, versatile, adaptive. Or it should be. And even better is the fact that you can have multitudes of various styles—as many as you like.</p>
<p>I wanted to spend some time talking about this because I edit and critique hundreds of manuscripts written by new authors. I see the various stages these beginners are in, and how they are attempting to develop a writing style. I often see writing that is very derivative or clearly structured to impress or to sound intelligent or clever. All in all, much of this comes across fake, forced, or awkward.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">To Thine Own Self . . .</h2>
<p>What’s the key to finding and developing your unique writing style? I think a lot of it has to do with being true to yourself. Ugh, I know how that sounds. Yes, you may at first emulate other authors’ writing styles. But there comes a point when you need to break through that wall separating you from them to establish your own special style.</p>
<p>So how do you know if you are being “true to yourself”? This may sound a bit New Agey, but I believe, as does author Elizabeth George, that if you listen to our body, it will tell you whether what you are writing feels true.</p>
<p>I wrote <a title="Why Writers Need to Trust Their Intuition" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2013/08/12/why-writers-need-to-trust-their-intuition/">a post on this</a> a while back, and what I’m saying, in essence, is when you write, try to listen to what your body is telling you. It will be honest with you.</p>
<p>Have you ever written a passage you really liked and wanted to use, but you had this nagging feeling it didn’t work? Then, when you squelched that warning and shared your passage with your critique team, what happened? They all responded the same way. It doesn’t work, they said. It feels wrong. Maybe they had more specific responses for you that helped you see why and in what ways that passage didn’t work. But, hey, you already knew that. Or, you would have, had you listened to what your body was telling you.</p>
<p>There’s an uneasy feeling of discomfort a seasoned writer gets when she veers away from a true and honest writing voice and starts forcing the style for one reason or another. Then again, a writer can just get burned out, or have days or weeks in which she feels uncreative and can’t seem to come up with effective prose that feels like her true voice.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Lots of Ways to Inspire a Beautiful Writing Style</h2>
<p>There are lots of ways to inspire creativity, to prompt ideas and the flow of beautiful writing (<a title="20 Things That Can Help You Find Inspiration for Writing" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/03/31/20-things-that-can-help-you-find-inspiration-for-writing/">here</a>, <a title="Go Ahead—Ignore Your Novel!" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/05/05/go-ahead-ignore-your-novel/">here,</a> and <a title="How Your Habits Help You Write a Book" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/01/27/how-your-habits-help-you-write-a-book/">here </a>are some posts that might give you ideas). My favorite way, which I also picked up from Elizabeth George, is to try to read something terrific before I start writing. A half an hour prep time spent reading a great author’s exquisite prose can often inspire me and jumpstart my stalled creative flow.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you won’t have to go back and diligently work on your passages. Fine-tuning by substituting word choices or coming up with similes or a catchy turn of phrase is part of honing your writing style.</p>
<p>You’ve probably heard the adage “garbage in, garbage out.” And then there’s “you are what you eat”—which could be rewritten to “you write what you read.” Keep in mind that reading a lot of drivel (you can determine what constitutes that) can adversely affect your writing.</p>
<p>You may have thought I’d be teaching you how to come up with a great writing style all your own. Sorry, that is something you will have to do. But by studying hard and emulating great writers, you will be on your way. Then, it’s a journey of many miles—not just a few blocks. Give yourself permission to let yourself go in your writing—perhaps <a title="Ways Writers Can Spark Creativity" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2013/06/03/ways-writers-can-spark-creativity/">freewrite,</a> experiment with different tenses or tones, or use writing prompts to try out new styles.</p>
<p>Be wary of asking for feedback from others. Oftentimes well-meaning critics will end up curtailing your creativity. Conversely, if readers are noticing problems with your style, pay attention and see what you can learn from their criticism (which, I hope, is kind and encouraging).</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts? What has helped you to come up with your “true” voice in your writing? What do you struggle with? Any advice for new writers who are looking to develop a strong writing voice?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today&#8217;s guest post is by author and screenwriter Harrison Demchick:</em></p>
<p>It’s a long, long road to publication, as months or years of writing give way to months of editing, and then more editing, and then <em>more</em> editing. But you’ve arrived at that very best version of your story. You’re proud of it, and you should be. And once you launch it on Amazon, or your publisher launches it into the world, there will be nothing between you and superstardom. Right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Not so much.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">No Guarantees</h2>
<p>Writers who follow the publishing industry already know full well that creative success and commercial success have, at best, a complicated relationship, and even the most carefully considered marketing plans include no guarantees. When my novel, <em>The Listeners</em>, launched in late 2012, I knew from my own seven years in publishing that the top of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list was pretty unlikely, and I was going to have to fight like hell even to make anyone <em>aware</em> of my book. After all, a million new books are published every year.<span id="more-6174"></span></p>
<p>It <em>was</em> a fight. I don’t know if I won. I don’t know if <em>you’ll</em> win. But we didn’t start writing to be rich and famous, did we? (If we did, my God, did we choose the wrong field.) We started writing because we had stories to tell. We started writing because we had dreams of creating something special.</p>
<p>So remember that, and remember this as well: just because you can’t quit your day job just yet doesn’t mean that there aren’t some really cool things that come with publication.</p>
<p><strong>1.) Readers</strong></p>
<p>You don’t need to reach the world to reach a single reader, and sometimes a single reader is all it takes.</p>
<p>One of the best moments early in my publication experience came when I received a YouTube review from a twelve-year-old boy in New Zealand. He loved the book, ranking it only behind Stephen King’s <em>The Stand</em> among his very favorite horror novels. It didn’t matter that this was only one reader, and it certainly didn’t matter that he was a bit younger than the typical reader I’d expected. Someone on the other side of the world—someone I will in all probability never ever meet, and someone with whom I will likely never even share a <em>continent</em>—read my book, and liked it.</p>
<p>The world is a small place. Launching your book out into it is one of the most validating ways to discover that.</p>
<p><strong>2.) Bookstores and Signings</strong></p>
<p>When you imagine book signings, you see a line out the door, every man, woman, and child in it clutching a hardcover copy of your book and waiting for you.</p>
<p>When you <em>see</em> book signings, you usually see a lonely author at a lonely table looking around anxiously for anyone to notice them.</p>
<p>You’re more likely to experience the latter than the former. But while there are certainly some depressing things about book signings—the worst for me was a two-and-a-half-hour drive to West Reading, Pennsylvania, for a signing that drew only three people, one of whom was the bookstore cat (who, like the others, did not buy a copy)—there are some really great parts as well.</p>
<p>For example: your book on a bookshelf in a bookstore. Maybe it’s just for the event. Hopefully it will sell, but maybe it won’t. But you can’t deny the tingle running up and down your body when you see your work in a bookstore for the first time. (Nor can you deny the subsequent happy dance that may or may not have been witnessed by the staff of Barnes &amp; Noble.)</p>
<p>Then there are the events. Some will get you pretty much nowhere, but then there are opportunities like BookExpo America. The summer after <em>The Listeners</em> came out, thanks to the Horror Writers Association, I had a chance to sign and give away one hundred copies to a genuine line of readers in only half an hour. Did it mean I was famous? Would I have moved that many books with a price tag? Of course not. But for just a little while, I was a rock star. It comes down to being open to the opportunities that emerge once your book is in the world.</p>
<p><strong>3.) Speaking Gigs</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how big your book is or isn’t. When you’re an author, people consider you an expert on something—on writing and publishing, if nothing else. And that’s because the vast majority of people who start a book never finish one. The simple fact of being a published author is an accomplishment in its own right.</p>
<p>And that means you can be on panels at writing events. You can speak with potential authors at writing groups. People care what you have to say—because you <em>do</em> have something to say. And you have the drive to say it.</p>
<p>The very best thing I have had an opportunity to do as an author is speak with the literary arts seniors at my old high school. I attended a magnet school where my focus for four years was writing, and though I graduated more than twelve years ago, it’s still a home for me, and it played a significant role in who I am today. To be able to go back there as someone who continued to pursue writing and became a published author is as special as anything else I could imagine. I’ve done it the last three years, and I love it every time.</p>
<p>So it’s actually not about people caring what you have to say. It’s about you having a chance to say what you care about.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What’s My Point?</h2>
<p>It’s far too easy to think of publishing as boom or bust. Win or lose. Succeed or fail. And the fact of most published do fail can make publishing at times a very depressing industry. But reality falls between the extremes, as it tends to, and just because your first book hasn’t set the world aflame, doesn’t mean that publishing isn’t a beautiful experience and your book a remarkable accomplishment.</p>
<p>Not everything will change once you’re published. But some things will. You’ll have opportunities you never had before, if you’re open to them and pursue them. And that makes it all worthwhile.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">A child pushes a plate away at the end of the meal and announces, “I’m done.”</p>
<p>The well-intentioned but misinformed parent chides, “You’re <em>finished</em>, dear. Cakes are <em>done</em>. People are finished.”</p>
<p>Are they? Is there a rule that tells when to use <em>done</em> and when to use <em>finished</em>?</p>
<p>According to the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>, <em>done</em> has been accepted and used in good company as the past tense of <em>do</em> dating back to the 1300s. There seems to have been some preference or practice for using <em>have</em> with <em>done</em> and <em>be/am</em> verbs only with <em>finished</em>. It’s also worth noting that <em>finished </em>is a more recent term, dating only to the 1700s. So the insistence on using <em>done</em> only in reference to things and <em>finished</em> to people is really a stubborn refusal to acknowledge the reality that languages are living, breathing, and changing things.</p>
<p>Modern dictionaries agree. Most define <em>done</em> first as a past form of <em>do, </em>which means to accomplish or complete an effort<em>. Done, </em>meaning “cooked adequately,” is much further down the list<em>. </em>But this does show that yes, people can be both done and/or finished.</p>
<p>However, <em>finished</em> implies an object (called a transitive verb) in this type of structure. Finished what?  Dinner. Finished with what? With eating.</p>
<p>But when using <em>finished</em> as an intransitive verb (not needing an object), it can also mean something like “I’m washed up,” “done for [there’s <em>done</em> again],” “I’m toast [okay, slang, but you get the idea].” Which gets me thinking about <em>done</em> and how it describes the degree something (like a cut of meat) is cooked. Can you be “well done” with your dinner?</p>
<p>So go right ahead and excuse yourself from the table with an “I’m done<em>.</em>”<em> </em>And don’t let anyone tell you you’re finished instead of done. Unless they really mean you are washed up.</p>
