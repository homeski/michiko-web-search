Endurance events. Spicy vodka. Graphic design textbooks. Massive multiplayer online games. Lilac bulbs. Tax preparation software. Workout regimens.</p> <p>If customers buy the stuff you make, then you got two things right:</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/content-marketing/" target="_blank">You built a healthy audience.</a></li> <li>You built products they love, which, of course, explains their buying behavior &#8212; if they have the money and they want it, they&#8217;ll buy it.</li> </ol> <p>It&#8217;s not magic. There&#8217;s a blueprint. <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com/training/" target="_blank">A faithful roadmap</a>.</p> <p>But that&#8217;s not all of it.<span id="more-44721"></span></p> <p>Between those two poles (building the audience and building the product), there is an element we can&#8217;t ignore: <em>the customer experience</em>. Which, no matter how hard you argue to the contrary, is probably terrible.</p> <p>Don&#8217;t kid yourself. Even if it is good, it can be better. And when the customer experience is better, your customers are happier. And when customers are happier, you make more money. </p> <p>Which is exactly what a <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~bain.com/bainweb/pdfs/cms/hotTopics/closingdeliverygap.pdf" target="_blank">Bain &#038; Company study reported</a>.</p> <h3>Why the customer experience usually stinks</h3> <p>See, the story businesses tell themselves &#8212; a whopping 80 percent, in fact &#8212; is that they deliver a &#8220;superior experience.&#8221; Not just a good experience. But a <em>superior</em> one. </p> <p>This story is fiction, however. Because when asked, only eight percent of customers believe these companies were actually delivering.</p> <p>That&#8217;s a huge discrepancy. So, why this customer experience gap?</p> <p>Two reasons:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Growth initiatives damage your loyal customer base.</strong> Initiatives like fee increases, feature changes, and license limitations. These changes piss off your best people.</li> <li><strong>Good relationships are hard to build.</strong> Need I say more?</li> </ol> <p>As the authors of the Bain &#038; Company report wrote: </p> <blockquote><p>It&#8217;s extremely difficult to understand what customers really want, keep the promises you make to them, and maintain the right dialogue to ensure that you adjust your propositions according to customers&#8217; changing or increasing needs.</p></blockquote> <p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/purpose-of-a-business.png" alt="purpose-of-a-business" width="650" height="613" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45850" /></p> <p>As the authors go on to write, even efforts to understand customers can backfire.</p> <p>We pillage the data in our web analytics, harvest the results from surveys, and identify patterns in purchasing behaviors. </p> <p>Good things to know, but ultimately &#8220;buyers become numbers rather than people, segments rather than individuals. Companies become deaf to the real voices of real customers.&#8221;</p> <p>Thus, the quality of customer experience declines, which doesn&#8217;t surprise Bryan and Jeffrey Eisenberg.</p> <h3>How big data misleads marketers and execs</h3> <p>In their book <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.buyerlegends.com/" target="_blank"><em>Buyer Legends</em></a>, the authors write, &#8220;This is the problem with all context-poor communication.&#8221; Without context, &#8220;statistics, test results, and best practices can often, and often have, misled many a marketer and executive.&#8221;</p> <p>To successfully read data, the authors explain, you need to understand the physical, emotional, and psychological environments where that data is mined. </p> <p>It&#8217;s a little bit like being an archaeologist, except your specimens are alive, not a scattered collection of ancient bones.</p> <p>However, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.kaushik.net/avinash/difference-web-reporting-web-analysis/" target="_blank">Avinash Kaushik points out</a> what typically happens: &#8220;The thankless job of web reporting is to punt the part of interpreting the data, understanding the context, and identifying actions to the recipient of the data puke.&#8221; </p> <p>Question is: Does that recipient understand the context? Probably not.</p> <p>Furthermore, analysts think the consumer of the future is likely to resist &#8220;tidy consumer segments&#8221; &#8212; a cardinal marketing concept.</p> <p>These analysts point to research that demonstrates low-income buyers reach for luxury items while high-end customers seek cheap items to satisfy basic needs.</p> <p>This creates a &#8220;consumer in the middle.&#8221;</p> <p>In their <em>Global Agenda</em> article &#8220;<a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.bain.com/bainweb/PDFs/cms/Marketing/Consumer_2020_Global_Agenda.pdf" target="_blank">The Consumer of 2020</a>,&#8221; market analysts James Allen and Darrell Rigby write, &#8220;understanding customers in the middle &#8212; and how they make purchasing decisions, depending on category, time of day, and even mood &#8212; will continue to be key to developing products and services.&#8221;</p> <p>Pay attention to that line between the em dashes: &#8220;and how they make purchasing decisions, depending on category, time of day, and even mood.&#8221; They are talking about the customer experience.</p> <p>So it&#8217;s not just about having the data, since Big Data is only half the equation &#8230;</p> <p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/big-data.png" alt="big-data" width="650" height="488" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45851" /></p> <p>The other half is Big Story.</p> <h3>How to make Big Data play nice with Big Story</h3> <p>&#8220;The ultimate challenge for data scientists,&#8221; says Laura Patterson in her article <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.marketingprofs.com/articles/2014/26436/why-your-data-scientists-need-to-be-storytellers-and-how-to-get-them-there" target="_blank">Why Your Data Scientists Need to Be Better Storytellers</a>, &#8220;is to use the data to create stories. Data scientists worth their salt can use spreadsheets and visualization tools to support analysis.&#8221;</p> <p>She continues:  </p> <blockquote><p>Their real value lies in their ability to transform the data into a narrative experience for both internal and external communication.</p></blockquote> <p>Tough sledding, unless you have the right tools.</p> <p>Tools like <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/empathy-maps/" target="_blank">empathy maps</a>, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/asset-pillar-infographic/" target="_blank">asset pillars</a>, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/master-storytelling/" target="_blank">storyboards</a>, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/content-gaps/" target="_blank">personas</a>, and <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/worldview-content-marketing/" target="_blank">worldview interviews</a>. </p> <p>But even with these tools, the insights can lead to fragmented, isolated stories. Your message, forgive the pun, is all over the map.</p> <p>What you need is a way to merge all this data and these stories into one Big Story. But before we get into that, what exactly do I mean by Big Story?</p> <p>Well, at this point, all I mean is the complete story of the customer journey with your product or service. From start to finish. It&#8217;s how a customer finds, interacts, and ends the relationship with you and your product.</p> <p>That&#8217;s the Big Story. The only story, really, that matters. And it involves everyone in your company. Not just the developers, analysts, and marketers.</p> <p>And to date, the best way to understand this journey is through the experience map.</p> <h3>The benefits of an experience map</h3> <p>&#8220;[The experience map] is the sum-totality of how customers engage with your company and brand,&#8221; says <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://hbr.org/2010/10/understanding-customer-experie/" target="_blank">Adam Richardson</a>, &#8220;not just in a snapshot in time, but throughout the entire arc of being a customer.&#8221;</p> <p>And according to UX designer, Luke Chambers, it&#8217;s an idea that was <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~uxmastery.com/ux-marks-the-spot-mapping-the-user-experience/" target="_blank">borne out of the user experience</a>. He unpacks some key benefits of the experience map:</p> <ul> <li>Create consistency in your messages</li> <li>Discover and capitalize on critical &#8220;moments of truth&#8221; for the user</li> <li>Unite isolated departments across your company</li> <li>Ignite a corporate focus on the customer</li> </ul> <p>As the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~mappingexperiences.com/" target="_blank">folks over at Adaptive Path point out</a> in their helpful <em>Guide to Experience Mapping</em>:</p> <blockquote><p>When done well, an experience map illuminates the holistic customer experience, demonstrating the highs and lows people feel while interacting with your product or service. The process of mapping uncovers the key customer moments that, once improved, will unlock a more compelling and more valuable overall experience.</p></blockquote> <h3>What does an experience map look like?</h3> <p>An experience map is a large visual of the path a consumer takes &#8212; from beginning to end &#8212; with your product. </p> <p>The goal of this map is to get everyone on your team on the same page about the customer journey &#8212; so it is to be shared. In addition, the map must be an easy-to-understand, self-contained unit.</p> <p>Here&#8217;s an example from <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/the-anatomy-of-an-experience-map/" target="_blank">Adaptive Path</a> for Rail Europe:</p> <p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/rail-europe-experience-map.png" alt="rail-europe-experience-map" width="650" height="488" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45852" /></p> <p>This map demonstrates the journey a consumer would take while riding the trains in Europe. It follows her from the early stages of research and planning to the end of her trip.</p> <p>You see what she is doing (searching Google, looking up timetables), what she is thinking during each action (Do I have everything I need? Am I on the right train?), and what she is feeling (Stressed: I&#8217;m about to leave the country and Rail Europe won&#8217;t answer the phone).</p> <p>It&#8217;s framed in guiding principles (the red band at the top) and terminates with opportunities for Rail Europe (engage people on social media, improve the paper ticket experience).</p> <p>In a piece on the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/the-anatomy-of-an-experience-map/" target="_blank">Anatomy of an Experience Map</a>, Chris Risdon at Adaptive Path suggests your experience map should have these five components:</p> <ol> <li><strong>The lens</strong>: This is how a particular person (a persona) views the journey. Keep in mind, this journey will not be the same for everyone. You will more than likely have more than one experience map.</li> <li><strong>The journey model</strong>: This is the actual design of the map. If all goes well, it should render insight to answer questions like &#8220;What happens here? What&#8217;s important about this transition?&#8221;</li> <li><strong>Qualitative insight</strong>: This is where the Doing-Thinking-Feeling of an empathy map comes in handy.</li> <li><strong>Quantitative information</strong>: This is data that brings attention to certain aspects of your map. It reveals information like &#8220;80 percent of people abandon the process at this touchpoint.&#8221;</li> <li><strong>Takeaways</strong>: This is where the map earns its money. What are the conclusions? Opportunities? Threats to the system? Does it identify your strengths? Highlight your weaknesses?</li> </ol> <p>And now that we have a handle on this artifact, let&#8217;s see it in action.</p> <h3>How to create an experience map</h3> <p>For starters, get the right people in the room.</p> <p>Invite a representative from every department in your company. If they touch the customer &#8212; in any way &#8212; invite them.</p> <p>At a minimum, invite a person from sales, marketing, customer support, legal, human resources, finance, IT, research and development, production, fulfillment, and any stakeholder.</p> <p>The Meeting Coordinator (MC) should send an invite for the meeting and explain that each person should come armed with a customer dossier. The MC can encourage the invitees to find this data in sources such as:</p> <ul> <li>Call center logs</li> <li>Web analytics reports</li> <li>File logs</li> <li>Customer satisfaction surveys</li> <li>Personas</li> <li>Interviews</li> <li>One-on-one interviews</li> <li>Comments on your blog</li> <li>Amazon reviews</li> <li>Real-life conversations</li> <li>Support emails</li> <li>Testimonials</li> <li>The social web</li> <li>Forums</li> <li>Customer conversations</li> </ul> <p>At the start of the meeting, the MC should make sure the meeting has these essentials:</p> <ul> <li>Large whiteboard or chalkboard</li> <li>Hundreds of Post-it notes</li> <li>Enough markers for everyone (a mix of color works nicely)</li> <li>A room large enough to fit everyone comfortably</li> <li>Snacks and drinks (especially caffeinated liquids)</li> </ul> <p>The MC should also lay some ground rules:</p> <ul> <li>All suggestions are welcome &#8212; even if these are gut intuitions and not necessarily backed by documented facts.</li> <li>All participants should feel free to approach the board to place Post-it notes, write, and draw to add to the map.</li> <li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to use words to explain &#8212; a lot of words (I&#8217;ll explain below).</li> </ul> <p>Risdon&#8217;s group at Adaptive Path suggests breaking up the map in a framework of what the customer is Doing, Thinking, and Feeling throughout the journey (see the Rail Europe map above for an example). </p> <p>Other categories you may want to consider are Place, Time, Devices, Channels, Touchpoints, and Relationships.</p> <p>This meeting should be a four-to-eight-hour affair. You want to work in one long stretch &#8212; of course with plenty of breaks, snacks, and a good lunch &#8212; until you&#8217;ve exhausted all avenues.</p> <p>The whiteboard may look like a big mess. That is okay.</p> <h3>Designing your experience map</h3> <p>If all went well during the meeting, the whiteboard should be a hot mess. But the MC, a designer, and a marketer (with writing chops) should sort through the mess and bring it to resemble something like this:</p> <p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/sf-muni-user-journey.png" alt="sf-muni-user-journey" width="650" height="399" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45853" /></p> <p>You can find that map and other examples <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/new-ways-of-visualizing-the-customer-journey-map/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <p>When you sit down to sort through the mess, keep in mind you don&#8217;t have to add all touchpoints that are mentioned. Select only the most important. The pivotal moments. </p> <p>What you are after is a comprehensive and meaningful picture of the customer experience with your product &#8212; so only include meaningful touchpoints.</p> <p>Once the MC, designer, and marketer have created a meaningful timeline, it&#8217;s time to design. And the principles of good design for experience maps include these:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> any viewer should be able to make sense out of the map at one glance. Don&#8217;t be afraid to include description boxes.</li> <li><strong>Keep it self-contained:</strong> The experience map should stand on its own. Everything needed to understand the map should be included.</li> <li><strong>Keep it sharable:</strong> Create a three-foot by six-foot poster to hang on the wall, but also create an 11-inch by 14-inch laminated version you can pass around.</li> </ul> <p>To quote Adaptive Path, &#8220;To tell a great story, you&#8217;ll need to focus, communicate hierarchy, sketch fearlessly, and try to keep it simple. When it all comes together, it&#8217;s time for the final payoff: using your experience map.&#8221;</p> <p>Once the map has been shared, your next step is to analyze the map. Here are two tools to help you do just that.</p> <h3>Creating the &#8220;prescriptive experience map&#8221;</h3> <p>The first tool is called the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis" target="_blank">SWOT matrix</a>.</p> <p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/swot-analysis.png" alt="swot-analysis" width="650" height="731" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45854" /></p> <p>While a Strength-Weakness-Opportunity-Threat matrix is normally used to evaluate the future of a project or business, I&#8217;ve found the matrix useful in asking the right questions when evaluating customer interactions:</p> <ul> <li>How do you know there is a problem? Is this a minor or major threat? How will it impact the company?</li> <li>How do you know this is an opportunity?</li> <li>Is this a strength? Is there a way to amplify this strength?</li> <li>Is this a weakness? Will it be meaningful and profitable if we improve it? This is where the SWOT comes in.</li> </ul> <p>The goal of this exercise is to help you find the actions, insights, and impact on the company that will lead to a prescriptive map.</p> <p>It&#8217;s always healthy, however, to prioritize the actions, insights, and impact on the company (not all of your discoveries will be meaningful or profitable).</p> <p>My favorite framework for determining priorities is the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Things_First_%28book%29" target="_blank">four-quadrant matrix</a>:</p> <ol> <li>Important and urgent</li> <li>Important, but not urgent</li> <li>Urgent, but not important</li> <li>Neither important nor urgent</li> </ol> <p>Once you&#8217;ve got your actions, insights, and impact on the company filtered through that framework &#8212; and the urgent and important aspects are taken care of &#8212; next you need to sit down and create the prescriptive experience map.</p> <p>This is the place of sublime customer experience. This is future-looking.</p> <p>To get there, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://hbr.org/2010/10/understanding-customer-experie/" target="_blank">Adam Richardson</a> says, &#8220;Almost every conceivable customer question, problem, and need has been anticipated and addressed, creating a seamless experience that appears &#8212; to the customer &#8212; effortless.&#8221;</p> <p>The prescriptive map is your ultimate goal. It&#8217;s a new map designed to guide your company in creating that customer experience that will make your mediocre experience a superior one &#8212; an experience customers will love. And you can test whether or not you reach that pinnacle of experiences through after-purchase surveys.</p> <p>Richardson points out:</p> <blockquote><p>This doesn&#8217;t happen by accident; it happens by design. As is often the case in life, making something look easy is very difficult.</p></blockquote> <h3>A quick and dirty experience map in action</h3> <p>Let me close with a personal example.</p> <p>Take <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/lede/" target="_blank">The Lede</a>, one of Copyblogger Media&#8217;s podcasts. What would an experience map look like for it?</p> <p>Well, as I mentioned above, there&#8217;s not one journey to rule them all, so in this case we&#8217;ll create an experience out of one of our personas (which is our lens).</p> <p>It will be our &#8220;marketing professional at an agency&#8221; persona. One journey might look like this:</p> <p style="padding-left:30px;">Imagine his boss emails him a link to follow Copyblogger on Twitter. &#8220;Treat their stream as a resource,&#8221; she says.</p> <p style="padding-left:30px;">He visits their website, searches their blog, and then creates a column in TweetDeck for all of his favorite Copyblogger writers.</p> <p style="padding-left:30px;">One of those writers shares a link to a podcast called The Lede. He clicks the link and listens to the episode online. He&#8217;s impressed, wants to listen to more, and decides to subscribe to the podcast.</p> <p style="padding-left:30px;">However, he can&#8217;t. He has an Android, and The Lede is not on Stitcher.</p> <p style="padding-left:30px;">The user has to listen to the podcast on the page. <em>Not his ideal experience.</em></p> <p style="padding-left:30px;">He then leaves a comment on <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://plus.google.com/+Copyblogger/posts" target="_blank">Copyblogger&#8217;s Google+ page</a> stating he wishes The Lede was on Stitcher.</p> <p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/the-lede-map.png" alt="the-lede-map" width="650" height="488" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45855" /></p> <p>This map then becomes a tool we analyze for underserved opportunities. </p> <p>Through a real, live experience, we discovered that we have an audience that wants the podcast to be available on Stitcher.</p> <p>So, it makes sense <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~copyblogger.com/stitcher" target="_blank">to put The Lede on it</a>. </p> <h3>Adapting content for each customer &#8230;</h3> <p>No doubt creating an experience map is a huge undertaking. It involves time and resources. And you want a healthy return for that investment. </p> <p>That&#8217;s why the map itself is not as important as what you get out of the map. The analysis is what counts &#8212; getting to the prescriptive map.</p> <p>Because the prescriptive map will help you create and adapt content and products to fit your customers&#8217; desires and tastes. Which will make them really happy. </p> <p>In other words, delivering content and products at the right time, on the right device, to the right person. </p> <p>That&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;ll be focusing on in 2015. Something called <em>adaptive content</em>.</p> <p>Stay tuned.</p> <p>And join us over on <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Could-This-Be-Secret-Making-8117878.S.5945910548502769664" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> to discuss how you evaluate your customers&#8217; experiences and how those experiences influence your content strategy.</p> <p><em><small>Flickr Creative Commons Image via <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.flickr.com/photos/captain_die/13736098644/in/photostream/" target="_blank">Alexander Rentsch</a>.</small></em></p> <div class="author-box"><div><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/81c83444aed195de41d9e227bf13c2dc?s=100&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D100&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-100 photo' height='100' width='100' /> <span class="subheading">About the author</span><h3>Demian Farnworth</h3><br><p>Demian Farnworth is Copyblogger Media's Chief Copywriter.

What about &#8230;</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> (Laughs)</p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> (Laughing) &#8230; content marketing?</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> Oh, content marketing! Okay. Content marketing. </p> <p>Thinking back over 2014, I think of two major events that &#8212; I don&#8217;t want to say <em>defined</em> content marketing &#8212; but at least changed the course, gave it a rumble, so to speak.</p> <p>The first event was when Google killed Authorship, and the other one was the emergence of native advertising.</p> <h3>The impact of Google killing Authorship</h3> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Let&#8217;s start with Google killing Authorship, because obviously that was big news. </p> <p>What about that really sticks out? And then, more importantly, what can we learn from that?</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> Google Authorship was something that Google rolled out about three years ago in June.</p> <p>It was an experiment, and &#8212; as we know with Google, nothing is a sacred cow &#8212; the experiment failed. </p> <p>Google Authorship was supposed to allow authors to claim their content and then display it in search results with markup code. </p> <p>Over the past three years, we&#8217;ve probably all seen when we&#8217;ve gone to Google and searched for something that some of those entries had photos on them. That&#8217;s the display or the image support that Google allowed. </p> <p>Google was trying to connect authors with their content, because they had PageRank, and PageRank evaluates and judges content based upon the content on that page. </p> <p>The other half of the equation is <em>who is the author</em>. They wanted to bring in an authority factor. So it was not just the content on the page that was important but also who wrote it. </p> <p>Authorship was their attempt to do that, and it didn&#8217;t work out. Ultimately, they killed image support. They actually, in December of 2013, reduced image support and then ultimately killed it in June of 2014. </p> <p>Then just this past August, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://plus.google.com/+JohnMueller/posts/HZf3KDP1Dm8" target="_blank">Google said Authorship&#8217;s done</a>, and it&#8217;s gone. </p> <p>The reasons why they did it were, first, low adoption rates. People weren&#8217;t implementing it. It was somewhat complex. It was even absent in some verticals. </p> <p>You go to some industries, and it&#8217;s completely absent. Nobody was implementing it. </p> <p>And, in fact, it had such a low adoption rate only 30 percent of the top 50 most influential social media marketers had implemented Authorship. </p> <p>Those who you&#8217;d think it would be most important to weren&#8217;t even getting involved, weren&#8217;t even interested in it. </p> <p>The other reason it failed was that it just had low value to searchers. The novelty had worn off.</p> <p>Google sees that half their searches come from mobile devices. And since photos and Authorship snippets didn&#8217;t look right in mobile searches, they decided to kill it.</p> <h3>Predictions about Google+ and Author Rank</h3> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Let me jump in here and highlight a lesson, what we can take from this. </p> <p>When Authorship came out, there was a pretty big rush of people, especially in our industry, who implemented it on their sites, and with good reason. </p> <p>And it also seemed to really increase Google+ usage there for awhile. Once they removed Authorship, it feels like people have started to use Google+ less.</p> <p>The lesson is, as always, with Google and any of these social media sites: You have to be careful about putting too many eggs in one basket because the rules of the game can change at any time, just as they did here. </p> <p>It&#8217;s not that implementing Authorship was a waste of time by any means, but it&#8217;s just another lesson that these things can change. </p> <p>It should just be one portion of your strategy, and you never want to go all in on anything that you don&#8217;t control.</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> That&#8217;s right. And I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised &#8212; even though they&#8217;ve said contrary &#8212; if at some point in the future that Google kills Google+.</p> <p>Because it&#8217;s a social site now as it stands, and that&#8217;s the only function that it&#8217;s really serving. Unless they find a fundamental use for it, it&#8217;s not serving a business objective.</p> <p>I would not doubt that it goes away, too. Because we saw comments and such drop off on our actual Copyblogger profile, and I think part of that is because Authorship ended. </p> <p>However, Author Rank itself &#8212; the concept that Google is trying to judge content based on who wrote it &#8212; is not dead.</p> <p>And Danny Sullivan at Search Engine Land <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~searchengineland.com/google-authorship-dead-author-rank-202254" target="_blank">discusses the current state of Author Rank</a> in a good article we&#8217;ll provide in the show notes. </p> <p>Because it&#8217;s still used in what&#8217;s known as in-depth articles, and of course, Google hasn&#8217;t told us this, but they have other ways of identifying author authority. </p> <p><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/author-rank/" target="_blank">Brian asked the question</a> in an article he wrote: What if Author Rank never happens? </p> <p>The answer is: It doesn&#8217;t matter <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/how-to-think-about-google/" target="_blank">as long as you&#8217;re still building authority and creating great content</a> &#8212; then you have nothing to fear. </p> <p>It&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been teaching you for the last eight years. If you continue to do those things, you&#8217;re in good shape.</p> <h3>Why we eliminated blog comments and our Facebook page</h3> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> One of the lessons that&#8217;s become a lot more clear to me this year is the idea that we&#8217;re all in business, right? </p> <p>An online business, or in business to make money &#8212; but to make money while serving an audience.</p> <p>That&#8217;s why I think it&#8217;s so important to understand this intersection of where you offer the most value to your audience, and then what drives profit in your business. </p> <p>And this is going to be different for everyone, right? </p> <p>Two decisions we made this year that created a lot of discussion were <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/removing-blog-comments/" target="_blank">removing blog comments</a> and <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/bye-facebook/" target="_blank">killing our Facebook page</a>.</p> <p>Some people agreed, some people didn&#8217;t, and everyone&#8217;s entitled to their own opinion. </p> <p>For us, it really came down to understanding where we provide the most value for our audience with limited resources. </p> <p>We can&#8217;t be everywhere at all times and everything to all people, so where do we provide the most value? </p> <p>In terms of our business, what actually drives revenue and profit? Understanding that intersection is what led to those decisions.</p> <p>It&#8217;s what you have to understand and think about when you consider possibilities such as &#8220;should we go after Google+, or should we step back from Google+? What social networks are we going to invest in? What type of content are we going to invest in?&#8221;</p> <p>It really is a lesson that is not specific to 2014, but understanding that intersection of where you&#8217;re providing value for your audience and where you derive the most business value really is a way to guide your decisions.</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> That&#8217;s right.</p> <h3>Is native advertising working?</h3> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Let&#8217;s move on to the next one. I know that you wanted to talk about native advertising.</p> <p>As you reflect back on the big research project you did on native advertising, what are your thoughts?</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> Native advertising has got to be the buzzword of the year, I think. Especially at the start of the year, it was huge. </p> <p>Companies were coming out of the woodwork to support it, and the funny thing is: we did a series and survey about it, and not very many people actually knew what it is.</p> <p>In fact, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/native-advertising-2014/" target="_blank">our native advertising survey results</a> demonstrated nearly 50 percent of the respondents didn&#8217;t have a clue what native advertising is, and another 48 percent had a shaky understanding of what it is. </p> <p>There were only about three percent that were very knowledgeable about it, and I guarantee those were people who have businesses that cropped up to serve native advertising. </p> <p>For those who don&#8217;t know, native advertising is paid content that matches a publication&#8217;s editorial standards while meeting the audience&#8217;s expectations. </p> <p>For example, if you go to BuzzFeed, you can see lots of examples of promoted content, native advertising. If you go there right now, you&#8217;ll see promoted content by PlayStation and Heinz. </p> <p>Another thing, too, is native advertising is not new. It&#8217;s just new online. </p> <p>Because <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/examples-of-native-ads/" target="_blank">David Ogilvy was doing native advertising</a> back when he did campaigns for Guinness beer, and we termed that an advertorial. </p> <p>It looked like an article, a top 10 best-of list, but it was an ad for Guinness. It was to promote their beer. It had a clear call to action, which is basically that a Guinness guy eats oysters. </p> <p>You eat oysters, and it&#8217;s best to wash them down with Guinness beer. Now we have the same thing online. </p> <p>That&#8217;s the editorial side of native advertising. </p> <p>There&#8217;s also the in-feed ad side of it: Twitter&#8217;s promoted posts, Facebook&#8217;s promoted stories. You&#8217;ll see in-stream ads inside apps, and Google text ads are also an idea that comes from native advertising.</p> <p>It&#8217;s just advertising that is basically invading, coming into the editorial space, but it&#8217;s designed to look as if it was editorial, if it was an article.</p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Let me ask you: is it working? Does it work, and what opportunities does it provide, especially as we look forward into next year?</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question because here&#8217;s the thing: Native advertising has been a boon for publishers.</p> <p>Many big, blue-chip media companies have come collapsing down because they can&#8217;t compete in the online world. </p> <p>Well, here comes native advertising and publishers get to sell major real estate at a premium price.</p> <p>Advertisers pay for this space, so this revenue model actually saves these businesses. </p> <p>BuzzFeed is a great example. VICE is another example. For the time being, this revenue model is profitable. The question is, like you said, will it be profitable in the long run?</p> <p>This is to be seen, because eventually the novelty will wear off. And in fact, the sponsored content&#8217;s native advertising does have a trust problem. </p> <p><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~contently.com/strategist/2014/07/09/study-sponsored-content-has-a-trust-problem-2/" target="_blank">Contently ran a survey in 2014</a> and demonstrated that people look at, say, an advertorial in Entrepreneur magazine by Dell with a very skeptical eye. </p> <p>And then <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/" target="_blank">ChartBeat</a>, a data analytics company, did a survey in early 2014. They said people simply are not scrolling on this content. </p> <p>Either advertisers are going to wise up and say, &#8220;Native advertising isn&#8217;t working,&#8221; or they will create compelling content that will actually engage an audience, and maybe close that trust gap. </p> <p>The opportunities are two-fold, I think. Brands are hiring a lot more writers to fill this gap because they see the value in native advertising, sponsored content, and promoted content. </p> <p>We&#8217;ve seen a lot of journalists become content marketers. </p> <p>But this could also be a revenue model for small-time publishers &#8212; actually allowing brands to come in and create content for their site as an ad. </p> <p>But again, this is like what you mentioned earlier. You don&#8217;t want to put all of your eggs in one basket.</p> <h3>The intersection of serving your audience and creating a profitable business</h3> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> And for some advertisers, native advertising isn&#8217;t going to be possible simply because of the budget. </p> <p>Like you said, it&#8217;s a big opportunity for small-time publishers, but when you look at it from the content creator side, it&#8217;s not always going to be feasible. </p> <p>That leads me into another lesson from 2014. There&#8217;s a lot of discussion about content shock &#8212; there&#8217;s all this content out there, so how do you rise above it? </p> <p>You&#8217;ve got to create better content. That simply doesn&#8217;t change. The quality of your content, its usefulness to an audience, has to continue to get better. </p> <p>That may mean thinking outside the box and finding new ways to reach people and new ways to maximize different mediums.</p> <p>Most of our audience, as well as us at Copyblogger, don&#8217;t have unlimited resources or unlimited budgets, right?</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> Right.</p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> If we&#8217;re going to invest more in our content, we&#8217;ve got to take time, effort, and resources away from something else. </p> <p>You have to find a balance between content and technology. </p> <p>If you can find ways to be more efficient with what you&#8217;re doing on the technology side, it will give you more resources on the content side. </p> <p>And obviously for us, we released the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com" target="_blank">Rainmaker Platform</a> as the solution. The technical part of your business is taken care of on this one platform so that you can focus more on content.</p> <p>I think as we look into 2015 that is going to continue to be so important, especially for publishers, advertisers, and companies who don&#8217;t have unlimited resources.</p> <p>For most of us, we need to find ways to be more efficient with technology so that we can invest more time into creating better content and become more successful with our content marketing efforts. </p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> And I think to add to that, the idea of content shock is silly because we&#8217;ve always been under a deluge of content. There&#8217;s never been a shortage.</p> <p>I can&#8217;t think of any time in my past that I&#8217;ve ever had a surplus of time to consume all the content that was out there. It&#8217;s always been a flood of content. </p> <p>It&#8217;s really about content fatigue, right? Saying the same thing over and over. Rather than &#8220;efficient,&#8221; I think a better word is probably being &#8220;effective&#8221; with your content.</p> <p>For example, instead of a daily publishing schedule, maybe you only publish twice a week so you have time to focus on creating and researching. </p> <p>Because the thing is, you have to figure out a way to rise above the noise. If you can pour more of your resources on one piece of content, then you&#8217;re going to create something better than if you&#8217;re spreading resources out to create five pieces of content. </p> <p>It&#8217;s also this idea of creating asset pillars, and I talked about this in a <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/asset-pillar-infographic/" target="_blank">blog post on infographics</a>. The infographic an as asset pillar reduces your content strategy time. </p> <p>Say you wrote five different articles that are in your archives. You&#8217;d take those, create an infographic, and then you create a podcast from that infographic, like we did with the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/ingredients/" target="_blank">11 Essential Ingredients Every Blog Post Needs</a>. </p> <p>It&#8217;s being smarter with what you have, especially for the small-time publishers. It allows you to pour more energy, focus, and creativity into one particular piece of content. </p> <p>It gives you a fighting chance versus spreading yourself thin. </p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> That&#8217;s a great point. So one more topic, here, before we close out this episode, and that is empathy, which is one of the biggest buzzwords from 2014. </p> <p>Anybody who attended our first Authority conference in Denver in May knows empathy was a big word. It really carried throughout the entire year. </p> <p>Let&#8217;s close out by talking about empathy and then also how it influences that next-step idea of experience and journey maps.</p> <h3>How empathy can influence the customer experience</h3> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/lede-empathy/" target="_blank">Empathy is this idea of relating to your customer</a>, being in their shoes, but then also wanting to provide a solution to their problem. </p> <p>For example, I have empathy for freelancers, because I&#8217;ve been in their shoes and I understand them. I know where they&#8217;re at, and so I can speak to their plight. Their plight resonates with my plight. </p> <p>Being able to do that is what we&#8217;re after. And so empathy is just another way of saying something that we&#8217;ve been saying for quite some time, which is about focus on the customer rather than upon ourselves. </p> <p>We&#8217;re constantly fighting this from a commercial standpoint. You shift from &#8220;it&#8217;s all about me, the brand&#8221; to &#8220;it&#8217;s all really about the customer.&#8221;</p> <p>In regard to empathy, what we&#8217;re trying to do is just relate to them. Google did this when they were promoting some of their products, like Chrome and gmail. </p> <p>They did it through the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vkVHijdQk" target="_blank">dad using Google products</a> to chronicle the birth of his daughter and document milestones as she grows up. That&#8217;s empathy, right? </p> <p>Procter &#038; Gamble did a <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V-20Qe4M8Y" target="_blank">commercial for mothers who are raising Olympic athletes</a> that spoke to everything mothers do for their children.</p> <p>It was a short commercial, but the idea was &#8220;we understand, we see what you do, so we want to create products that help you do your job better.&#8221; That&#8217;s empathy, too. </p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Our next episode of The Lede will tie what we learned in 2014 into what we&#8217;re going to focus on in 2015.</p> <p>Empathy is really the first step toward being able to provide the most personalized experience to your users.</p> <p>You have to understand what they&#8217;re thinking, what they&#8217;re feeling, and what they&#8217;re going through to really be able to tailor content that&#8217;s going to fit their needs at any given time.</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> Right.</p> <h3>The next episode of The Lede: looking ahead to the evolution of content marketing in 2015</h3> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> I think one of the concepts that is starting to gain some traction that will gain even more traction in 2015 is adaptive content.</p> <p>You can&#8217;t adapt content if you don&#8217;t understand who you&#8217;re adapting it for. And that&#8217;s why empathy is such an important building block and foundational principle.</p> <p>We&#8217;re actually going to talk about that in our next episode. This episode was more about looking back to 2014. </p> <p>Our next episode, which will be the final episode of The Lede in 2014, we will look ahead to 2015 and talk about some of the trends that we expect to see and how we individually, and as a company, are planning to capitalize on those.</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> Right. </p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Any final thoughts here, Mr. Farnworth, before we close?</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> Yes. I was just going to say I have an article coming out on experience maps that will explain more of what we&#8217;re talking about here. </p> <p>But it&#8217;s a natural progression from empathy to experience maps. An experience map is just a story of how your customer interacts with your product and your brand from start to finish. </p> <p><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/lede-journey-maps/" target="_blank">We talked about customer experience maps with Brian</a>, and as I did more research on it, it became clear that it&#8217;s a natural next step to what we&#8217;re calling adaptive content. </p> <p>Because once you understand who your customer is and the interactions they have, and you see the high points and the low points, then you can create a better, a sublime customer experience from that experience map. </p> <p>I suggest creating a prescriptive map, meaning looking forward. What is the most sublime, supreme customer experience you can create? </p> <p>You can only do that by resonating, knowing your audience, knowing your customer, creating that experience map, and then creating that content, which then adapts to how they interact with your brand.</p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> In closing, Demian, I know we&#8217;re recording this podcast before Thanksgiving, but it&#8217;ll be released after. I just want you to know that I&#8217;m very thankful for you and for your contributions to The Lede.</p> <p><strong>Demian</strong>: That&#8217;s very, very, very sweet of you. I need to find a tissue.</p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> (Chuckles) All right.</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> I am very, very grateful for you too, Jerod. Honestly.</p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Thank you.</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> Yes. And you have a wonderful Thanksgiving in your new home, with your gal. Are you guys spending Thanksgiving in your new home?</p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> No. We are actually doing the family thing this year, and then next year will be the first time that we bring everybody together in the house. </p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> Great. Right. Okay, good. All right, buddy.</p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Yes. All right, man. Always a pleasure, and we&#8217;ll be back to wrap up the year in a couple weeks.</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> I&#8217;ll be talking to you. Sounds good, man. Take care.</p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> All right. Bye.</p> <p>Thank you for listening to this episode of The Lede.

You&#8217;re aware of their daily struggles and aspirations. </p> <p>Subsequently, you produce content on <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com/register/" target="_blank">your digital media platform</a> that <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/blog-post-formula/" target="_blank">speaks directly to those problems</a> and follow up your analysis by offering your best strategies to address each issue.</p> <p>But if you only focus on the small percentage of people who are in dire straits &#8212; those who literally lose sleep about the problems you&#8217;d like to help them work through &#8212; you may be ignoring a lot of readers.</p> <p>Here&#8217;s an example.</p> <p>Let&#8217;s say you help people declutter their homes. Some of your readers may be at the end of their ropes. Perhaps they have a serious hoarding problem or large collections that take over their living spaces &#8212; and their lives. </p> <p>If they had to put their level of willingness to address their problem on a scale of one to 10, your most desperate readers may find themselves at a nine or 10 &#8212; and the magnitude of their problem could be just as severe.</p> <p>But unless you <em>only</em> want to help out the extreme cases, writing directly to that archetype may leave readers with a more moderate need for decluttering feeling like they don&#8217;t need your service. </p> <p>Perhaps the boxes in their basements or unfiled papers in their offices are a nuisance, but they haven&#8217;t taken over their lives. </p> <p>If you stick with extreme examples, any readers unable to relate to those circumstances may feel like your message doesn&#8217;t apply to them.</p> <h3>Emotional fatigue</h3> <p>I recently started reading a post about public speaking, which is a skill I&#8217;m interested in further developing. I didn&#8217;t make it through the post, though. </p> <p>The opening paragraphs explained the level of panic some people feel when speaking publicly. </p> <p>The writer assumed that my hands would be sweating and I&#8217;d get knots in my stomach simply by entertaining the possibility of getting up on a stage.</p> <p>I got exhausted just reading the introduction.</p> <p>If I had that level of panic about public speaking, I imagine that there&#8217;s a very good chance it would be insurmountable. </p> <p>And although talking to a crowd isn&#8217;t something I&#8217;m entirely comfortable with, it&#8217;s not something that instills my fight-or-flight response &#8212; so the post was draining to read.</p> <p>Even if your readers <em>sometimes</em> work themselves up in a frenzy over concerns related to your area of expertise, it&#8217;s likely that they&#8217;re not in that frame of mind while reading your post. </p> <p>Overplaying their emotional responses can therefore create a disconnect, causing readers to disengage with your writing.</p> <h3>Feeling manipulated?</h3> <p>The biggest danger of overplaying emotional appeal is that a thoughtful sales offer for a credible service or product can start to sound like a slimy sales pitch.</p> <p>A reasonable sales pitch begins with a problem people have, and then explains a solution and its benefits. It doesn&#8217;t rely on manufactured fear or an artificial need, nor does it promise an instant fix. </p> <p>It will speak to the audience&#8217;s emotions, yes &#8212; because <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/writing-with-emotion/" target="_blank">that&#8217;s how we make decisions</a>. But it also offers a real solution to a real problem, and follows through with that promise.</p> <p>A slimy sales pitch relies on exploited emotions and exaggerated claims. It may overstate or twist the facts to boost a weak case. It overplays the extent and severity of a problem and the effects of doing nothing. </p> <p>An unethical salesperson highlights an unlikely extreme and presents it as an inevitable fate for anyone who doesn&#8217;t buy.</p> <p>Let&#8217;s look at the wrong way to sell a water filter as an example.</p> <p>An overhyped sales pitch for a water filter begins with an exaggerated emotional claim, such as &#8220;Are you embarrassed by the taste and look of your drinking water? Worried that your friends will find out the truth and declare you an unfit parent and a danger to the community?&#8221;</p> <p>An artificial fear then follows the exaggerated emotional claim, such as &#8220;Studies show that people without water filtration have a 543 percent greater risk of cancer!&#8221; (Never mind that these &#8220;studies&#8221; carry as much scientific validity as a Harry Potter novel.) &#8220;Are you willing to risk the lives of your family? I only have five filters left! Your children&#8217;s health may depend on you making the right choice.&#8221;</p> <p>The ethical way to sell the same water filter would be to explain its features and discuss health, environmental, and financial benefits, followed by a call to action to try the water filter in order to experience better-tasting, contaminant-free water.</p> <h3>How to avoid emotional manipulation</h3> <p>The first step is awareness. You must acknowledge that even readers with strong pain points aren&#8217;t necessarily losing sleep over the problem you can help them fix.</p> <p>And if the issue does lead to sleepless nights, they may not be experiencing that level of anxiety at the moment they read your post.</p> <p>Here are three ways to offer the right amount of emotional appeal in your writing.</p> <p><strong>1. Vary your examples instead of only highlighting extreme cases</strong><br> When you avoid overstating problems or the mindsets associated with them, you can still discuss worst-case scenarios if they provide value for your audience. </p> <p>However, make sure to temper dramatic extremes with moderate cases. </p> <p>For example, you can include a case study featuring a client who only needed a little bit of help alongside a case study of a person whose life was completely changed because his situation was so dire.</p> <p>If you offer multiple levels of services, writing about different scenarios that appeal to different types of readers is a no-brainer.</p> <p><strong>2. Improve your offer</strong><br> Make sure you&#8217;re completely confident about your offer. Adjust it or even start over until you&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ve created a special presentation. </p> <p>If you have your finger on the pulse and consistently adapt to address your audience&#8217;s changing needs, you won&#8217;t need to rely on emotional manipulation or hype.</p> <p><strong>3. Get to know your audience and figure out their problems</strong><br> <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/lede-journey-maps/" target="_blank">The more you tap into your readers&#8217; experiences</a>, the more you can produce smart solutions to their problems in your content, products, and services. </p> <p>If you truly address their issues, you won&#8217;t need to manufacture extremes to remind your readers how much easier their lives would be if their problems were alleviated with your solutions. They&#8217;ll already know.</p> <h3>Your turn</h3> <p>When you create content, what steps do you take to thoroughly understand your readers&#8217; experiences?</p> <p>And how do you make a deep connection with your audience without exploiting their emotions?</p> <p>Let&#8217;s continue the discussion over on <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Dont-be-overly-emotional-in-8117878.S.5943010389569576963?trk=groups%2Finclude%2Fitem_snippet-0-b-ttl" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> &#8230;</p> <p><em><small>Flickr Creative Commons Image via <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.flickr.com/photos/julochka/9458790153/" target="_blank">julochka</a>.</small></em></p> <p class="alert"><em><strong>About the Author:</strong> Yael Grauer is a freelance writer and editor who specializes in making complex topics accessible.

As freelancers, consultants, content publishers, and small business owners &#8230; </p> <p>It&#8217;s in our DNA. </p> <p>Our founder, Brian Clark, was a recovering attorney in the mid 90s when he discovered the Internet and just knew he could make a living from it. </p> <p>In less than a decade, he went on to build several businesses before he grew Copyblogger Media into a $10 million a year company &#8212; started, mind you, from nothing more than a blog that published two articles a week. </p> <p>And just about every other employee here has either ran a business or freelanced online. People like Sonia Simone, Brian Gardner, Chris Garrett, Jerod Morris, Robert Bruce, Lauren Mancke, Rafal Tomal, Stefanie Flaxman &#8230; and the list goes on and on. </p> <p>Fact is, probably none of us would have made it without the Internet. It&#8217;s the perfect medium for growing an audience (especially for the introverts among us).</p> <p><span id="more-44644"></span>But while the Internet has lowered the cost of doing business by providing a bevy of free tools, we also understand there is still a cost.</p> <p>And that&#8217;s what we want to discover. We want to know how much you are spending to run a business online. </p> <h3>Why you should take this survey</h3> <p>We decided it&#8217;s high time we surveyed our readers on the specific issue of the &#8220;cost of an online business.&#8221;</p> <p>Why? A number of reasons:</p> <ul> <li>To help us create content that solves your online business problems</li> <li>To help us develop new products that better serve your emerging needs</li> <li>To help us upgrade our current products based upon those needs</li> </ul> <p>In short, we need this information to serve you better.</p> <p>But you need it, too.</p> <p>How else will you be able to accurately evaluate your current strategies and tactics &#8212; and their associated costs &#8212; if you don&#8217;t know what other folks are doing and what&#8217;s working for them?</p> <p>You need to know your options.</p> <p>And that is the other goal of this survey: to give you information that will make you a more informed and savvy online business owner. </p> <h3>Not to mention you get a gift</h3> <p>And if that&#8217;s not enough, just to show our appreciation for you taking the time to fill out this survey and help us, yourself, and your fellow online business owners, we&#8217;ll send you a free PDF report once the results are in. </p> <p>This is a 57-question survey covering the full spectrum of running an online business.</p> <p><strong>We will close the survey on November 30, 2014, and on January 5, 2015, we will publish the results as an infographic.</strong></p> <p>In addition, we will deliver a free PDF report to anyone who provides an email address.</p> <p>Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey!

I&#8217;m your host, Jerod Morris.</p> <p>On Monday, November 17, we published a post on Copyblogger titled &#8220;<a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/full-time-blogger/" target="_blank">What You Need to Know to Make a Living as a Blogger Right Now</a>.&#8221; It was written by Demian Farnworth.</p> <p>In the post, Demian highlights the two biggest concerns for the average blogger: obscurity and sustainability.</p> <p>In other words, for the vast majority of us who set sail creating content online, we want to first develop an audience, and then once we have an audience, we want to find a way to earn a living from our content.</p> <p>The first concern can feel daunting enough, because building an audience isn&#8217;t easy.</p> <p>The second concern can feel damn near impossible because despite countless examples of people who have done it &#8212; who have built successful, thriving businesses around their online content &#8212; sometimes we struggle to see ourselves succeeding in the same way.</p> <p>Which is silly.</p> <p>So long as you&#8217;re willing to take pride in working hard, and have a humble heart and mind when it comes to learning from the people who have already done it, you can build an audience that drives a sustainable online business.</p> <p>There is, of course, a sustainability road map. </p> <p>It&#8217;s what Brian Clark and Robert Bruce chart for you in the free New Rainmaker training course that you will find at <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com/register/" target="_blank">newrainmaker.com/register</a>.</p> <p>Go ahead and get started with the two-week course if you aren&#8217;t one of the 25,000-plus people who have taken it already.</p> <h3>Our personal stories of success and failure online</h3> <p>In this episode of The Lede, Demian Farnworth and I are going to share some of our personal stories of success and failure online in the hopes of inspiring you and educating you.</p> <p>But mostly inspiring you, because if we&#8217;re here hosting a successful podcast like The Lede for a company as strong as Copyblogger Media, then there really isn&#8217;t any reason why you can&#8217;t find your path to online success too.</p> <p>Demian, you love your job, at least based on all of my interactions with you. You seem to love your job. You get to dive deep into work that you really love without having to sacrifice time with your lovely wife and your two incredible kids.</p> <p>I would say that you have found a way to overcome the obscurity and sustainability concerns you wrote about in your most recent post. How did you get here, and what role did your personal blog, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~thecopybot.com/" target="_blank">Copybot</a>, play in it?</p> <p><strong>Demian Farnworth:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question. Copybot was my business card, and that&#8217;s kind of lame, but really: it&#8217;s the place, it&#8217;s the hub, it&#8217;s the place to point people.</p> <p>It&#8217;s also my book, and it&#8217;s everything that I need to create visibility, both in the search engines and just the social sphere. </p> <p>When I quit the corporate world and said I was going to work for myself, I knew that I needed a website, and so I started writing that website, and that allowed me to work through a lot of content that I had created in my mind.</p> <p>When I was looking for guest writing and freelancing opportunities, I needed somewhere to point people back to &#8212; a body of work.</p> <p>That&#8217;s exactly what Copybot allowed me to do, and that&#8217;s the purpose that it serves. That&#8217;s the body of work that I&#8217;ve created.</p> <p>It&#8217;s my portfolio. It&#8217;s my resume.</p> <h3>How to overcome obscurity</h3> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> So putting the content out there, creating these posts on Copybot, that kind of got you started with the whole overcoming-the-obscurity part that you talked about in your post.</p> <p>And then you talked about going out and guest posting using Copybot as that reference. How did you then go from overcoming the obscurity concern, getting the audience, and then to a point of sustainability?</p> <p>You&#8217;re not on your own anymore, but you have a career now that you built on your own. How did you get there?</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> I tell everybody I talk to that we all start at the bottom, and I certainly started at the bottom.</p> <p>I had some connections, but I wasn&#8217;t on anybody&#8217;s radar as &#8220;This is someone you should hire; this is someone who&#8217;s doing things.&#8221;</p> <p>There&#8217;s not a day that goes by now when I don&#8217;t get an email or some sort of response in the social sphere where someone asks to interview me or wants advice, or wants me to guest write.</p> <p>Clearly, I started out with none of that, and I started out with nobody knowing, virtually, who I was. And so there&#8217;s no secret.</p> <p>This is kind of lame, but it was just simply putting one foot in front of the other and consistently creating that body of work, and reaching out, and creating that work that people admire.</p> <p>Creating work, like you said, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/guest-posting-best-practices/" target="_blank">guest posting</a>.</p> <p>That&#8217;s first and foremost one of the best ways in order to expand your visibility, to increase your visibility, and the other thing, too, is to write things about other people that challenges what they say.</p> <p>There might be some influencer in your industry who you don&#8217;t agree with, and so if you do that respectfully in a meaningful, articulate, and powerful way, then people are going to pay attention to that and you&#8217;ll get on their radar.</p> <p>It&#8217;s not a flash-in-the-pan type of thing either. You have to do it consistently.</p> <p>It&#8217;s better to be on a slow burn than it is to be firing out with all cylinders and all cannons blazing and stuff like that.</p> <p>Because a fast rise usually precipitates a fast fall, too &#8212; you want a slow, steady burn.</p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Your story is compelling to me especially &#8212; and also our audience &#8212; because I think your story in particular is closer to what most of our audience experiences than perhaps mine.</p> <p>I didn&#8217;t have the corporate job first, haven&#8217;t had a family, so I&#8217;ve been able to make a lot of decisions just based on what was best for me in the moment.</p> <p>You did all of this with a family, having that job, being a little bit more settled.</p> <p>What I&#8217;m curious about, and I think the point that a lot of our listeners, a lot of our audience members get to, and people that I&#8217;ve talked to get to when they get to the sustainability concern is that moment of fear, the moment of trepidation, being able to take that leap of faith.</p> <p>What was your scariest moment? What was that moment of trepidation for you, and how did you overcome it?</p> <h3>The scariest part of starting an online business (and how to conquer it)</h3> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question. My scariest moment was the morning after I had turned in my two-weeks notice, because I had nothing else planned, with no job lined up.</p> <p>I would not recommend anybody do this.</p> <p>But it came down to points like &#8212; no, I&#8217;ll let God worry about the future, I need to worry about today, right here. And so I did that, and that was definitely the scariest part. </p> <p>I had lunch with <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~goinswriter.com/blog/" target="_blank">Jeff Goins</a> a couple of weeks ago, and he and I were talking about that sort of moment, and he had a much better approach.</p> <p>He actually built the business while he still had a firm, steady job, and he had a wife, and I believe they had a young one at this time.</p> <p>He had those family concerns, but he built the audience, and then he built the business behind it.</p> <p>He sold the products that made him a lot of money, and he finally got to the point where he thought &#8220;I can do this.&#8221;</p> <p>He will tell you he&#8217;s very conservative, and he had way more money than he needed, if there&#8217;s such a thing, but he was definitely in a position to say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m ready to make this move.&#8221;</p> <p>I took that leap partly because that&#8217;s just my personality. To be honest, I don&#8217;t do anything unless my back is up against the wall.</p> <p>I&#8217;m lazy, I&#8217;m passive, and yes, I do have self-discipline. I can keep a job, and I&#8217;m loyal to that job, but at the same time, if I need to make a dramatic change in my life, I will.</p> <p>If I had not made that move, I would not be here.</p> <p>I would still be stuck in a dead-end job, just moping along, continuing to do the daily grind without the opportunities that I have now.</p> <p>Despite the pain that I went through, I&#8217;m glad I did it. I would never wish or recommend anybody to do it, because there is a better way to do it. However, like I said, I don&#8217;t regret that moment. </p> <h3>The importance of building an audience that builds your business</h3> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> I think it&#8217;s important to understand, too, that everybody who has succeeded online, going through this process of building an audience, then building a business around that audience, has their own individual story. </p> <p>A lot of people have your story, where their backs were against the wall for some reason, or they hated what they were doing, and this almost felt like the only way out, or they had to do it.</p> <p>But it&#8217;s not necessarily always some act of desperation. </p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> Right.</p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> I talked about this in the intro &#8212; that there is a road map for success doing this. So many people now have succeeded doing it in different ways, with different audiences, for different reasons.</p> <p>What is the through-line of success, then, for the people who succeed online?</p> <p>Because ultimately, there are people behind audiences, and behind the businesses that they build.</p> <p>While everybody has their own story, for people listening and maybe they&#8217;re trying to think about if this is the path for them, or maybe they&#8217;re at that moment of trepidation themselves, what should they look at in themselves to say, &#8220;Okay, if you have this, if you can do this, then you will succeed.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> The best way to answer is probably to talk about how I learned a lot about myself when I went to work for myself. Because within the first eight months, I realized that I did not want to do this.</p> <p>I did not like working for myself. I thought I would; I thought it would be the perfect opportunity for someone who&#8217;s an introvert and who manages themselves well.</p> <p>Like I said, I am driven and I have initiative, but about eight months in, I was like &#8220;I need to find a job.&#8221; I already had the structure, but I realized I didn&#8217;t want to build a business.</p> <p>However, back to Jeff Goins. I&#8217;m impressed with him because he had that desire and that drive, and the ability to build that business.</p> <p>He built the audience, and then his business is basically the membership model with the training courses, so that&#8217;s working incredibly well for him.</p> <p>You have to find out who you are and what you want. You have that drive to build something like a business, and that&#8217;s the path you follow.</p> <p>Even those people who have built full careers, rather than just businesses &#8212; Chris Brogan, Seth Godin, those guys &#8212; they, again, built audiences and then they built the businesses behind them.</p> <p>It just begins with going from that point of obscurity, getting the visibility, building the audience, and then figuring out how to monetize that.</p> <p>Conventional methods for monetization are advertising or affiliate marketing, and there are people who are quite successful at affiliate marketing.</p> <p>I think those are channels and streams of revenue, but they probably shouldn&#8217;t be your sole method.</p> <p>You would also want to have memberships, forums, training courses, ebooks, and resources. Maybe also do some consultancy at the same time.</p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> We talked about this on our editorial call yesterday, actually. And I&#8217;m curious to bring this part of the conversation to the listeners.</p> <h3>If we could go back in time 10 or 15 years, knowing what we know now, what would we do differently?</h3> <p>I think Robert asked, &#8220;If you could go back in time 10 or 15 years, knowing what you know now, what would you do differently?&#8221;</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> That&#8217;s a good question. I really wasn&#8217;t sure how to answer that yesterday, but I&#8217;ve given some more time and thought to it.</p> <p>I wouldn&#8217;t go down the corporate path. I would have realized that I&#8217;m a maverick and I need to find environments that allow that to be my strength, which Copyblogger does.</p> <p>I probably would have paid more attention to the Internet, of course, because I paid zero attention until probably the year 2001. What about you? What would you do differently?</p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question. Like you, I didn&#8217;t know how to answer it when he asked it, but I&#8217;ve spent some time thinking about it.</p> <p>Ten years ago, just like you, I wasn&#8217;t really paying attention to the Internet.</p> <p>I love where I am now, and if you had told me then that I&#8217;d be where I am now, I&#8217;d have said, &#8220;You&#8217;re crazy,&#8221; because it&#8217;s been such a zig-zaggey, roller-coastery ride here that couldn&#8217;t have really been predicted.</p> <p>I would make the conscious choice that this is where I wanted to be, and I think I&#8217;d do more to get here faster and to be even further.</p> <p>Part of that would involve some of the blogging projects I had before, like the sports blog that I had; I&#8217;d do that in a much smarter way.</p> <p>I&#8217;ve talked about this before &#8212; that kind of flying by the seat of my pants, loving the part of creating content, and enjoying getting traffic, all that was great.</p> <p>And <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.midwestsportsfans.com/" target="_blank">Midwest Sports Fans</a> generates a lot of revenue, which led to the development of <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~websynthesis.com/" target="_blank">Synthesis</a>.</p> <p>A lot of positives came out of it, but I didn&#8217;t even understand the first part about building an audience.</p> <p>That site was pretty much obscure a week after a big post if there wasn&#8217;t something daily on there because I wasn&#8217;t building content assets, right?</p> <p>It was pretty much the opposite of the Copyblogger model, but I think all of that effort that I put in there early on was so valuable just in terms of learning about content creation and some of the basics.</p> <p>If I had been smarter then about actually building an audience, building an email list, and building an asset with that, I mean &#8212; I shudder to think what that could be now, as valuable as the experience I actually had was.</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> Tell me if you think differently, but for me for some reason, that question too, &#8220;What would you do differently 10 to 15 years ago if you knew what you knew today?&#8221; &#8230; I always have trouble with that question.</p> <p>I think I would not engineer it any differently because, for me, it&#8217;s part of the fun. It&#8217;s like learning about yourself, right?</p> <p>That wisdom, that experience, that suffering, the trials and tribulations that you go through. Maybe I&#8217;m just sadistic, but I enjoy that because it&#8217;s a learning process, and it&#8217;s an experiment for me, too. </p> <p>Both you and I probably think a lot alike in that sense, and I think this is true for a lot of us at Copyblogger. We may not be entrepreneurs, but we have that spirit within us that we want to try something new, we want to try a new initiative. </p> <p>We&#8217;re never short of ideas, and we&#8217;re always kind of pushing the envelope and saying, &#8220;Hey, what can we do next? How can we do that?&#8221; Which, again, is a great opportunity.</p> <p>I wouldn&#8217;t give up the experiences that I went through 10 years ago. Because ultimately what we want is to speed up where we&#8217;re at.</p> <p>We always want that shortcut. But is that fair?</p> <h3>What you need to know to start your online business</h3> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Here&#8217;s the other question I wanted to ask you: what advice would you give to someone listening now?</p> <p>Someone who reads Copyblogger, who listens to this podcast, who knows that they want to create content, but maybe doesn&#8217;t have the perfect vision or plan for what they want to do yet.</p> <p>Why should he or she get out there anyway? Ten years ago, we couldn&#8217;t have really predicted that we&#8217;d be where we are now, and I think that&#8217;s true for a lot of people in this day and age.</p> <p>And that&#8217;s okay.</p> <p>Even when you start out online, where you end up online may be completely different from where you started.</p> <p>Starting out as a sports blogger, ending up at Copyblogger. You can&#8217;t really predict that.</p> <p>What advice would you give to somebody who&#8217;s teetering on that line between &#8220;Should I do it? Should I not? I don&#8217;t really have that perfect plan yet.&#8221;</p> <p>Why should that person do it anyway? Or should they?</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> You don&#8217;t need the perfect plan.</p> <p>I was just talking to a good friend who&#8217;s kind of branching out on his own. He was saying: &#8220;Here is my tagline. This is going to be my unique selling preposition.&#8221;</p> <p>He had four or five, and I said, &#8220;Listen. All those are great. Choose one, move forward, because it will change.&#8221; It will evolve over time because as you experiment, as you get out there and you do things, it will change.</p> <p>You will say, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s not working, but some people seem to want to go this way.&#8221;</p> <p>The question you have to answer, though, is: &#8220;Do you have the passion, the energy to sustain this long-term?&#8221;</p> <p>If it&#8217;s something that you&#8217;re considering, it might be a good hobby but if you think &#8220;Jeez, I&#8217;ll exhaust this in 30 days,&#8221; then it&#8217;s probably not a good business idea.</p> <p>Because the one thing that you have to have is that energy to say, &#8220;I want to do this. I want to make this happen. I can see myself spending the rest of my life, at least for the next decade and a half or whatever, doing this.&#8221;</p> <p>You&#8217;ll need that because the first two years, you&#8217;re going to feel like you&#8217;re alone.</p> <p>You need to have that belief and that vision to accomplish what you can, and to sustain it until you get to the point where you have an audience that you can then monetize, that you can then leverage into work, whether it&#8217;s for yourself or with another company.</p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting. Tell me if you agree with this, but I feel like a lot of times people&#8217;s perceptions get flipped about what it&#8217;s like to create success online.</p> <p>I think people think that it will be easy in the sense that it doesn&#8217;t require as much work, but they also may be intimidated because the technology part is hard.</p> <p>I actually think it&#8217;s the opposite.</p> <p>Like I talked about: The road map is there, right?</p> <p>The <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com/register/" target="_blank">New Rainmaker training course</a> is one example of a road map that shows you how to get to that point of sustainability. </p> <p>So many other people have charted that course &#8212; that part is actually simple.</p> <p>But I think it&#8217;s the other part: the daily grind, to use that term. And just like you said, the passion to do it consistently over time. That&#8217;s really the harder part, where more people fail.</p> <p>But it doesn&#8217;t have to be if you have mentors and study the examples of others. Do you find that, too? Do you agree with that?</p> <h3>Why many online business models aren’t sustainable</h3> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> I do, and I think your experience is a great example with the Midwest Sports. You had a quick rise to success and fame, but did you have the long-term sustainability?</p> <p>Because it is hard work. </p> <p>That&#8217;s the truth. And for me, it is a lot harder because once you have the visibility and people are looking at you, there&#8217;s a lot more pressure in order to perform.</p> <p>My biggest fear is that I will become stale, I will become routine, I will become predictable. And I don&#8217;t want to do that. </p> <p>For me it&#8217;s always constant &#8212; I want to beat everything I&#8217;ve done previously. And that&#8217;s a lesson that I learned.</p> <p>I remember I waited tables for about six months. I was absolutely terrible at it. But I got great advice from a server who was really good.</p> <p>He said, &#8220;You&#8217;re only as good as your last table.&#8221;</p> <p>Whatever he meant by that, which I&#8217;m not 100 percent sure, but I interpreted it, the young, impressionable 21-year-old I was, as: &#8220;You have to continually improve and beat each time. Each table is an opportunity to excel from what you did last time.&#8221;</p> <p>That&#8217;s the pressure that I&#8217;m on now, and so when I come to a piece of work, again, I deal with that procrastination of thinking, &#8220;Shoot. How am I going to make this the best thing that I&#8217;ve ever created?&#8221;</p> <p>There&#8217;s a lot more pressure because a lot more people are looking at you and expecting things from you.</p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> It&#8217;s funny, thinking back. Midwest Sports Fans are still going today, although I&#8217;m not active on it on a daily basis. It&#8217;s funny. The passion, the excitement, was never the problem.</p> <p>I always woke up excited to create content. What eventually killed it, though, was having such a <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/grow-email-list/" target="_blank">poor strategy where you essentially start over every day</a>.</p> <p>One of the reasons why that strategy was poor is because I didn&#8217;t have enough humility. I thought I had all the answers, and thought, &#8220;Okay, this is working. I don&#8217;t really need to study and figure out the next step. This is working; let me just keep doing it.&#8221;</p> <p>Eventually the flame started to flicker out a little bit because it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Man, it&#8217;s the same thing all the time.&#8221;</p> <p>If you&#8217;re not actually building an audience and building assets with your content, then you&#8217;re just like a hamster on a wheel. </p> <p>Every day you start over just trying to drive traffic for the page view based ad revenue, which is a model, but that can kill that passion too. </p> <p>I think long-term you really want to study the successful models and figure out a way to build assets that aren&#8217;t just going to lose value the next day.</p> <p>Because that will kill your passion. That&#8217;ll kill your excitement for it.</p> <h3>Demian&#8217;s one critical piece of advice for anyone just starting an online business</h3> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> Right. Right. </p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Well Demian, this has been fascinating. I love talking with you about your history, your path, your journey.</p> <p>Which is why we wanted to take a little break from doing the series that we&#8217;ve been doing on The Lede and have a more personal episode that talks about our experiences.</p> <p>Hopefully we&#8217;ll hear some of your stories in the comments on <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Copyblogger/posts" target="_blank">Google+</a> or <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://twitter.com/copyblogger" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p> <p>Or email us: Jerod [at] copyblogger [dot] com or Demian [at] copyblogger [dot] com.</p> <p>Tell us your story. Because they&#8217;re interesting, and we love hearing them.</p> <p>Although we all have our own individual stories, there are a lot of through-points that we all experience, that we can relate to and help each other out with.</p> <p>Always a fun conversation, Mr. Farnworth.</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> Thank you. I appreciate it.</p> <p>I&#8217;ll just end with this: I&#8217;m always really kind of surprised and I&#8217;m always humbled when someone says, &#8220;You&#8217;ve inspired me,&#8221; or I get an e-mail of encouragement. </p> <p>To me, that&#8217;s how I know what I&#8217;m doing is working.</p> <p>I&#8217;ve been given &#8212; we&#8217;ve all been given &#8212; a talent. Something to do.</p> <p>I think the best response to that talent, which I consider a gift, is to become the best you can absolutely be at that and that alone.</p> <p>They&#8217;ll be ups and downs.</p> <p>The point is, just be grateful for whatever attention you get. Because, ultimately, &#8220;I have so many followers on Twitter&#8221; is not what count. What counts is the lives you touch and the relationships you form, if that makes sense.</p> <p>Be grateful for whatever you get. Always be grateful. That&#8217;s helped me enormously.</p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Great final thought to end on, Demian. Thank you.</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> You bet. </p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> We&#8217;ll talk in a couple of weeks and get another series started.</p> <p><strong>Demian:</strong> Sounds good.</p> <p><strong>Jerod:</strong> All right, man.
