</p><p>By <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+CorinaKochMacLeod" target="_blank">Corina Koch MacLeod</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/+CarlaDouglas82/?rel=author" target="_blank">Carla Douglas</a></p>
<p>Are you looking to polish your NaNoWriMo book in the new year? Are books on your holiday wish list? (Silly question, right?)  Below is a list of 19 self-editing books that we believe every indie author should have on his or her bookshelf. These books will arm you with valuable writing tips and insights so that you can tackle your writing with new resolve.</p>
<p>We’ve divided the books into <a href="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/2014/04/4-levels-of-editing-explained-which-service-does-your-book-need/" target="_blank">levels of editing</a>, so you’ll know which book to refer to when you need to. Keep in mind that a book may not fit neatly into an editing category. Some books will address more than one level of editing. The key is to be systematic when you self-edit, and often, addressing one level of editing at a time can make the editing process more manageable.</p>
<p>To remind you, how you’ll revise and polish your book will depend on <a href="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/2014/11/editors-post-nano-tips-for-revising-your-novel/" target="_blank">how you tend to work as a writer </a>, and <a href="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/2014/05/are-your-readers-trying-to-tell-you-something-how-to-use-reader-feedback-to-improve-your-writing/" target="_blank">where your strengths and weakness lie</a>.</p>
<h3>Self-Editing Workflow</h3>
<p>If you’re not sure where to begin your revisions, start with big-picture items. When assessing a manuscript, editors begin with big-picture items and slowly work through all the stages of editing, ending with word-level details. If you’ve nailed your plot (big picture), for example, begin with the next area that you know needs work. If you’re not sure what needs work, run your manuscript past a couple of <a href="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/2014/03/5-things-you-should-know-about-working-with-beta-readers/" target="_blank">betareaders</a>.</p>
<h3>Criteria for Self-Editing</h3>
<p>It wasn’t easy narrowing our choice to 20 titles for self-editing. Many excellent books have been written on various aspects of the subject. We’ve chosen books that are</p>
<ul>
<li>short(er) and to the point</li>
<p></p>
<li>helpful (some of them are personal favourites) </li>
<p></p>
<li>easy to understand, without too much editorial jargon</li>
<p></p>
<li>less than $15, with one exception (Jim Taylor’s <em>Quick Fixes</em>) </li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>As a result, books commonly used by editors didn’t show up on this list. Why? Writers are not editors. Many books directed to editors are also written by editors, and they’re heavy on theory and discussion. Writers want accessible books that provide clear explanations, examples and instructions. (Editors like these books too—but we like to read everything and think about it, first.) So you’ll see some writers’ craft books on this list—our choices address revision and self-editing directly.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ve also picked a couple of titles specifically for nonfiction authors (they’re marked with an asterisk). When it comes to writing and self-editing guides, nonfiction often gets short shrift. The two we’ve selected complement each other well, and provide sound advice for focusing and delivering your message to the reader.</p>

</ol>
<h3>Self-Editing is a Process</h3>
<p>Don’t try to do it all at once, and don’t try to do it only once.</p>
<p>Each of the books we’ve recommended offers a different voice and a different approach. Some are straight “how-to” and some are more “what” and “why.” What works for one writer might not be right for another. So take some time to explore a few of these titles to find an approach you can work with.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“When you write…say, ‘I’m free to write the worst junk in the world.’ You have to give yourself the space to write a lot without a destination.”</em> — Natalie Goldberg
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you haven’t already, over time you’ll develop your own self-editing style. This may mean working to a detailed plan or, as it does for some writers, simply reading, re-reading and re-keying your draft multiple times.</p>
<p>And, as we’ve said before, how you self-edit depends on how you wrote your first draft. It will also depend on your manuscript and what it requires—your second, third and fourth books will present different issues than your first. All the more reason to have our 20 titles at the ready, lined up on your shelf.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="post_image_link" href="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/2014/12/curating-content-for-the-self-publishers-ultimate-resource-guide/" title="Permanent link to Curating Content for The Self-Publisher&#8217;s Ultimate Resource Guide"><img class="post_image aligncenter" src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-15-at-11.22.30-PM.png" width="530" height="275" alt="Post image for Curating Content for The Self-Publisher&#8217;s Ultimate Resource Guide" /></a>
</p><p>Some years ago, on a trip to Melbourne, Australia, I visited a book publisher with a friend who was in the book publishing business there.</p>
<p>There was the usual layout of offices and a production area, where the familiar tools for book layout and design were apparent.</p>
<p>But most of the activity in the office was in a separate room, where about a dozen people sat at desks, all of them talking nonstop on the telephone. Not a typical sight in a book publishing enterprise.</p>
<p>When I asked what they were doing, the answer was that they were all editors of different directories this firm published, and they spent virtually all their time checking on the listings in their various publications to make sure they were up to date and accurate.</p>
<p>When I asked to see the books they were publishing, I was shocked (I&#8217;m being honest here) to see that all the directories were very plain, printed on inexpensive white offset paper, paperbound, and all the text was set in Courier, and consequently looked a lot like typewriter copy, not typesetting.</p>
<p>This company was very successful, and could have made their books look any way they liked. When we got to talking about the operation, I mentioned the almost crude appearance of the books, which typically cost $100 and up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our customers are buying information, not literature,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;These books are designed to make them feel that they are getting the most current, hot-off-the-press information with no bells or whistles, not even a decent typeface.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard to argue with their success.</p>
<h3>New to Directory Publishing</h3>
<p>Publishing directories, like our just-released <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Self-Publishers-Ultimate-Resource-Guide-Directory--ebook/dp/B00QSKUS2Q/?tag=marinbo-20" target="_blank">The Self-Publisher&#8217;s Ultimate Resource Guide</a>, is new to me. I&#8217;ve produced them for clients, but never published one myself.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Self-Publishers-Ultimate-Resource-Guide-Directory--ebook/dp/B00QSKUS2Q/?tag=marinbo-20"><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SPURG-3D-275x.jpg" alt="self-publishing" width="275" height="345" class="alignright size-full wp-image-35176" /></a></p>
<p>And I remembered the most important thing about a directory; that the information be &#8220;fresh&#8221; and accurate. These are criteria that guided us&#8212;Betty Sargent, me, and the other researchers who worked on the book.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/number-1-in-directories.png" alt="self-publishing" width="205" height="69" class="alignright size-full wp-image-35174" /><br />
We received a lot of queries about why some people were included in the book and others excluded.</p>
<p>It was best phrased by Contributing Writer <a href="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/jason-kong/" target="_blank">Jason Kong</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;In your description of the guide, you mentioned how the links of the listings are curated and verified but I didn&#8217;t see anything about what your standard was for being included in the first place. So my question is:<br />
<span id="more-35173"></span></p>
<p><em>&#8220;What was the criteria for a company or business to be included in your book?</em></p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t sound like you&#8217;re personally recommending these vendors or anything like that. And I assume whatever standard you used for your initial book will also be applied to future editions, especially when with all the submissions you&#8217;ll be receiving via your contact form. I assume many people will be submitting their own businesses and services. :)&#8221;</p>
<p>And Jason is right, criteria for inclusion were only briefly mentioned in my first posts about the book.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how I replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jason, good question.</p>
<p>The listings are not meant to imply an endorsement of the person or company listed. Our concern was to only list people who</p>
<ul>
<li>were actively engaged in their business, </li>
<li>who work with self-publishers, and </li>
<li>who, as far as we know, are not scammers or organized solely to take advantage of authors. </li>
</ul>
<p>Are some better at business, customer relations, timeliness, etc? Yes, it&#8217;s very likely because we didn&#8217;t attempt to screen people and companies listed at that granular a level. </p>
<p>But we eliminated, for instance, every questionable supplier who was listed with a &#8220;not recommended&#8221; rating on <a href="http://pred-ed.com/peba.ht" target="_blank">Preditors &#038; Editors</a>, and all the book awards companies known to be associated with unsavory practices.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not perfect or comprehensive, and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve asked people in the community to send us listings, and let us know the experience they have with people, listed or unlisted. </p>
<p>We aim to continue to expand the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Self-Publishers-Ultimate-Resource-Guide-Directory--ebook/dp/B00QSKUS2Q/?tag=marinbo-20" target="_blank">Resource Guide</a> with the help of readers, and make it even more useful in a variety of ways as we continue to grow it.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I talked to my co-author <strong>Betty Sargent</strong> about the curation process, she added some interesting perspective to the conversation.</p>
<h3>Our Standards Are High</h3>
<p>&#8220;We aspire to include only the most reputable, highly regarded, currently active professionals in our continuously vetted and updated resource list.</p>
<p>&#8220;In many cases we know and have worked with these people personally.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we don&#8217;t know them we triple check their references, often contact them ourselves, and always make sure their websites are up and running&#8212;and fulfilling the services described.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although it&#8217;s always possible that a person or two may have slipped through the cracks, we make every effort to find out about that and delete any person or group that <em>may not have the self-publishing author&#8217;s best interest at heart</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to establish <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Self-Publishers-Ultimate-Resource-Guide-Directory--ebook/dp/B00QSKUS2Q/?tag=marinbo-20" target="_blank">The Self-Publisher&#8217;s Resource Guide</a> as the gold-standard in the Indie Author universe and we welcome your input in helping us reach and sustain this goal.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Let Us Hear From You</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re counting on you&#8212;authors, editors, designers, artists, printers, production people&#8212;everyone in our community to help us fill any gaps in the Resource Guide.</p>
<p>I know there are a lot of excellent providers who we simply missed. Hey, the internet&#8217;s a big place.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we set up a submission page where you can let us know about a great editor or terrific cover designer we&#8217;ve left out. You can send us your submissions here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spresourceguide.com/contact/" target="_blank">The Self-Publisher&#8217;s Ultimate Resource Guide Submissions</a></p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got any questions about people in the book or not in the book, <strong>let me know in the comments</strong>.</p>
<p>And get your copy today. You know you&#8217;ll be using it soon enough.</p>

</p><p>As the year winds down many of us will be reviewing our progress through 2014 – our successes and our failures, what we learned and have yet to learn about writing and self-publishing – and making plans and resolutions for 2015. These articles might help with that so take a break from the shopping or the wrapping or the baking or whatever is keeping you busy this holiday season, and have a read. I think you&#8217;ll be glad that you did.</p>

&#8220;You’ve heard the snide comments. Self-published books are crap. They aren’t edited. They are amateur. They are not worth our notice. Many such comments were deserved. They still are in some cases.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;Last week, I became a self-published author for the first time. An indie. It’s still sinking in that after so many years of yearning to be a novelist, I have a book I can hold in my hand.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;There’s a lot of misinformation around about paid reviews, customer reviews, Fiverr reviews and the ethics and technical issues surrounding them for book sales. Frankly, I’m tired of the many forums banging on with the phrase, “I am totally against paid reviews.”  And yet the hallowed Amazon review has become the new god of all indie authors. For all the wrong reasons.&#8221;</p>
