				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">I think we can all agree that subjects and verbs need to agree with one another. A singular subject takes a singular verb.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nancy is the school librarian.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plural subjects take plural verbs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nancy and Ned are friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>But we don’t always write with such simple subjects. What is the correct verb form in these sentences?</p>
<ul>
<li>A pack of wolves was/were howling in the distance.</li>
<li>A bundle of ballots was/were found in the official’s car.</li>
<li>A flock of geese is/are migrating overhead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each subject includes both a singular and a plural noun: pack—singular/wolves—plural; bundle—singular/ballots—plural; flock—singular/geese—plural. So do you use a singular or plural verb?</p>
<p>I could get into a lot of technical terms here like <em>notional vs. formal agreement</em> and <em>predeterminer</em>. But I prefer <em>Merriam-Webster’s</em> “plain sense” solution: “When you have a collecting noun phrase (<em>a bunch of</em>) before a plural noun (<em>the boys</em>), the sense will normally be plural and so should the verb.”<span id="more-4912"></span></p>
<p>But there is another way of understanding this. A noun/subject phrase like “a bundle of ballots” includes a head noun—bundle. The noun establishes whether the verb is singular or plural. In most cases, that will be correct.</p>
<p>Applying this principle to the above examples, we would choose the following verbs:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pack of wolves was howling . . . (The intent or emphasis here is on the pack—singular.)</li>
<li>A bundle of ballots was found . . . (Again the sense of the subject is that <em>many</em> ballots were located someplace they should not have been.)</li>
<li>A flock of geese is migrating . . . (Though it would not be improper to say a flock of geese <em>are</em> migrating, if your sense is that the emphasis should be on the geese rather than the flock.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t you love it when you get to determine what’s right and wrong?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve spent a whole year looking at the twelve pillars of novel construction, and I hope you’ve gained a lot of great, new insights on how to “build” a novel. I want to take a little time to go over some points about construction that I hope will stick with you through the years as you write your many novels.</p>
<p>There are plenty of books that teach novel writing. I probably have most of them in my library, and there are some great ones, to be sure. What prompted me to put this material together for my blog (and which I’m now compiling and expanding to release as a book in a few months as part of my Writer’s Toolbox Series) is that, despite all the great writing craft books available, many writers are struggling with novel structure.<span id="more-6235"></span></p>
<p>I critique and edit more than two hundred partial and complete manuscripts a year. Year after year, I see struggling writers making the same fatal mistakes in their manuscripts. Even those writers who have studied the best novel-writing instruction books and have followed writers’ blogs and have taken numerous workshops <em>still</em> don’t get the structure.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Why Bother with Structure?</h2>
<p>Is structure important? Do I think novelists have to follow very specific structural rules to write a great novel? Yes and yes. When I first started writing novels, I thought I could wing it. I’d read plenty of various genres all my life, so in a way, I felt that made me an expert. I assumed that by osmosis I’d learned how to write well. And that was true—to a point.</p>
<p>Truth is, a lot of writers believe they can write a novel without taking time to learn the nuts and bolts of novel construction. I wonder why this is. I doubt many aspiring doctors or dentists or lawyers believe they can jump into their practice by just reading a few books, or maybe even by watching some TV shows. I certainly wouldn’t want to learn that my surgeon <em>hadn’t</em> graduated medical school or read <em>Gray’s Anatomy </em>as I’m being wheeled on a gurney into the operating arena.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Novel Writing Is Not Easy</h2>
<p>Writing a novel may not be as complex as performing an operation on someone, but it does have its complexities. Just as with building a house—which is what we examined deeply in this course—writers have to adeptly wield not only a whole lot of materials but a lot of tools as well. For every task in building a house, a builder must know both his materials and his tools. You don’t frame up a house with tarpaper, and you don’t use plastic pipe for gas lines. It takes time and effort to acquire the proper training to be proficient in any vocation. Novel writing is no exception.</p>
<p>I will venture to say that at least 80-90 percent of the novels I critique are seriously flawed in structure. Some so much so that they really need to be round-filed. I cringe hearing how some of these writers have spent years penning their first novel (or perhaps many subsequent ones), and often have spent additional years trying to get an agent to sign them. These are wasted years. Sure, all that effort may have been a good learning experience—to a point. But I liken this to someone without any training being given a thousand car parts and then told to put it all together (maybe with a four-page diagram) and end up with a perfectly operational and beautiful vehicle. It’ll never fly (or drive).</p>
<p>Some of the above-mentioned writers actually do spend hard hours studying novel structure. They buy the best books, attend workshops and conferences, hire editors, and join critique groups. But they still suffer novel failure. Over and over I see the same essential problems plaguing manuscripts. So what is the problem? Are they just not trying hard enough? Can only the smartest, most talented people write great novels?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">There Are Lots of Books, but . . .</h2>
<p>No, I don’t believe that. I believe just about anyone with the determination, a love of storytelling, a good imagination, a firm handle on language and composition, and a jar of “butt glue” (to keep one stuck in that chair and writing) can write a great novel.</p>
<p>But I also feel there is a dearth of how-to books that really address the key problems new novelists face and find daunting. Aspiring novelists can find hundreds of books that will teach them tips on how to write a great plot, develop believable characters, and craft catchy dialog. There are books that focus on just about every novel component, and writers could spend years studying these books and still not really grasp how to construct a novel. Why? Because so much of what is taught is about the tools of the trade, but not so much about how to construct the entire “house.”</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Think Holistically</h2>
<p>Just as building a house is a very complex undertaking, building a novel requires a similar holistic approach. When a builder looks at blueprints, he sees “the big picture.” He has to understand every single aspect of the process and think ten steps ahead (that’s how my builder husband puts it). When he looks at the foundation blueprints, he envisions how this will affect the task of hanging joists and laying out the roofline. When studying the details for the concrete forms, he’ll check the rebar specs to make sure they are going to be the right thickness to support that second story extension.</p>
<p>That house will never be built right if the builder only tackles one task myopically at a time. Every step of the way, he must keep in mind the finished product and how it is slated to look. He has to consider how every single part of this construction process affects and informs all the others. It’s like seeing the forest and not just all the individual trees.</p>
<p>And this is exactly what a novelist must do as well, and what few (if any) writing craft books teach. For a writer to write a great novel that is constructed soundly, she must work with the “big picture.” All the elements in a novel—plot, premise, theme, characters, etc.—must work holistically, and fit together perfectly. Too often writers throw a bunch of materials together and grab random tools they little know how to use and get hammering. The result is usually a disaster. What is most painful is when the foundation is seriously flawed—meaning the core concept itself just doesn’t hold together. For then, everything that is built upon such a foundation cannot stand. The house will collapse. The novel will fail.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Just Writing Won&#8217;t Cut It</h2>
<p>Writing a novel is not easy, despite what some say (and usually it&#8217;s the people who have never written one who say that). And practice does not make perfect. If you keep practicing your musical scales using improper technique and poor hand position, you will enforce bad habits and keep playing them badly. Writing a lot of words or participating in NaNoWriMo (writing a novel in one month) can help writers with discipline and stick-to-itiveness, but without getting a grip on proper novel construction, writers won’t write great novels. They may have a lot pages to show for their effort, but in some ways (okay, shoot me) it’s wasted effort. Getting into the habit of writing daily, or learning how to push yourself to meet deadlines—those are good things. But they will not help you write a great novel.</p>
<p>So, my aim with this course was to get right to the essentials of how to wield the tools and materials of novel construction <em>as well as</em> teach you how to look at your story holistically. Instead of learning one novel component at a time, disconnected to any other components, I’ve tried to help you think in terms of building all your support pillars together and in a way that they work together to hold up your story.</p>
<p>I’ll go more into review on this in next week’s post, but I’d love to hear your comments. What pillar of construction do you struggle most with? Are there any that you hadn’t really understood but now have learned ways to use them constructively in your story? Share some thoughts on how this course has helped your novel.</p>
<p>Have you printed out all your inspection checklists yet? Be sure to do so, and use them for every novel you work on. These 144 sets of questions will help you examine the structure of your key pillars and (I hope) prevent you from novel failure!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today&#8217;s guest post is from editor and author Blake Atwood:</em></p>
<p>What’s the first thing you do after writing the final word of your book’s final draft?</p>
<p>I push away from my computer, take a deep breath that tastes like satisfaction, then just as quickly pull myself back to my desk to send the manuscript to my editor.</p>
<p>It wasn’t always this way.<span id="more-6215"></span></p>
<p>With the release of my first self-published book, I hesitated to even seek an editor’s help. As a first-time author, I was certain I’d never earn back the expense. Still, every podcast I’d been listening to and book I’d been reading strongly encouraged hiring an editor. So, out of two solid suggestions, I chose the least expensive editor. I’m glad to report that she enhanced the quality of my book (and that the book earned back its expenses).</p>
<p>After I had successfully completed the (grueling) editing process, I realized a deeper motivation had deterred me from getting an editor to look at my book, something much more terrifying than the possibility of losing a few hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>I was afraid I would be found out as a writer.</strong></p>
<p>I feared that showing my words to a professional editor would reveal me to be the naked, pompous emperor from the classic Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale “The Emperor’s New Clothes.” Upon reading my book, I was certain my editor would play the part of the blunt child in the old story and yell out, “But he isn’t a writer at all!”</p>
<p>If there’s one thing writers of all kinds know all too well, it’s insecurity.</p>
<p>I know you believe me, but in case you’re one of those (few) overly confident writers, consider these quotations from writers whose success might make us think that they seldom struggle with fear:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I’m afraid of failing at whatever story I&#8217;m writing—that it won&#8217;t come up for me, or that I won&#8217;t be able to finish it.” —Stephen King</li>
<li>“I know it is the best book I have ever done. I don’t know whether it is good enough.” —John Steinbeck</li>
<li>“Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand.” —George Orwell</li>
</ul>
<p>Orwell’s right, and Steinbeck echoes the same sentiment of a writer’s constant inner battle between his insecurity and wild self-confidence: “The greatest foolishness of all lies in the fact that to do it at all, the writer must believe that what he is doing is the most important thing in the world. And he must hold to this illusion even when he knows it is not true. If he does not, the work is not worth even what it might otherwise have been.”</p>
<p>As writers, we waver between the extremes of self-flagellation and self-adulation. We may sometimes <em>simultaneously</em> believe that our book is both the best and the worst thing ever written, and we’re not sure which answer most people will believe until we actually send our hard-won words off to an editor. But I can promise you—so long as you find the right editor for your book, your book will be better for having had an editor’s input.</p>
<p><strong>But how do you get over that initial fear of sending your book to an editor, especially if you’re a first-time author?</strong></p>
<p>First, realize what Steven Pressfield says is true: “The professional loves her work. She is invested in it wholeheartedly. But she does not forget that the work is not her.” Your book, even though it may feel like part of your soul, is not you. (This is helpful advice for when that first bad review is published too.) If you can learn early on how to separate yourself from your words, you will better serve your words, your writing career, and your emotional health.</p>
<p>Second, <em>never</em> look for validation from an editor. That’s not an editor’s job. In fact, an editor may never provide encouragement to you, at least not in the “I think this will sell millions” kind of way that your naive friends might offer. You’re not paying a professional editor in order to hear how awesome your book is. You’re paying him to make your book awesome. But to get to that point requires humility and a willingness to be shown where your writing is lacking. It requires knowing that you don’t know everything.</p>
<p>When warranted, some editors <em>will</em> provide encouragement. Such editors know what one of my friends in the publishing business said: “Editors are like good counselors. It may hurt to take the advice, but it&#8217;s worth it.” Being edited isn’t easy, but it’s what you have to do if you want your book to have the best possible opportunity of being read and selling.</p>
<p>Lastly, when you get back a manuscript that’s riddled in red from an editor, don’t see that as evidence you should stop writing. View it as a testimony to the fact that you’re a professional writer seeking professional help so you can produce a professional piece of art.</p>
<p>Today, if you have a suspicious view of editors, change your mind-set and begin considering editors the way poet and author Blake Morrison suggests: “Editing might be a bloody trade. But knives aren’t the exclusive property of butchers. Surgeons use them too.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Pronouns take the place of nouns. When you use a pronoun, you must be sure that its antecedent (what it refers to) is clear. For instance, who does <em>her</em> refer to in this sentence?</p>
<ul>
<li>Both Heidi and Mary loved her children.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Her</em> is an unclear pronoun because we don’t know if it refers to Heidi’s children or Mary’s children.</p>
<p>So let’s look at one word that can be a little tricky: <em>other</em>. It’s one of those words that serves multiple roles in our language—noun, pronoun, adjective, or adverb. But for our purposes right now, let’s look at its role as a pronoun.</p>
<p>You’ve probably read a sentence like this a hundred times and never given it much thought:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesse’s artwork has been displayed in the Omaha Public Library, Creighton University, and the governor’s mansion, among others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then again, you may have wondered, “among other whats?” Here <em>others</em> does not have a clear antecedent. It’s a pronoun without a noun. What do the proper nouns in this sentence have in common?<span id="more-4908"></span></p>
<p>They are venues, but that fact hasn’t been defined in this sentence. So to be clear, the sentence could be recrafted in one of these ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesse’s artwork has been displayed in the Omaha Public Library, Creighton University, and the governor’s mansion, among other venues.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this variation, <em>other</em> is an adjective describing venues. Another option is to insert the noun <em>venues</em> earlier in the sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesse’s artwork has been displayed in venues like the Omaha Public Library, Creighton University, and the governor’s mansion, among others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it is clear that <em>among others</em> refers to venues. A similar construction avoids the problem completely:</p>
<ul>
<li>He has created artwork for doctors, lawyers, politicians, and others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here there is no ambiguity because <em>others</em> is a noun like its antecedents “doctors, lawyers, and politicians.” I trust we can all agree on that.</p>
<p>So take a moment to look through your manuscript and check those pronouns. Make sure you have a clear antecedent.</p>

My blog is a labor of love for all writers striving to write the best books possible! I&#8217;m grateful. Now . . . here is the last post on the last pillar of novel construction!</i></p>
<p>When our beach house fell off a cliff due to El Nino years ago, we felt a horrible sense of loss at this sudden catastrophe. We had been married on the back deck, and the spot we’d stood upon and said our vows now hung out sixty feet in the air, a hundred feet above the roaring surf. In combing the beach after the disaster, I picked up one brick from the fireplace that we’d spent many long, peaceful hours in front of, watching the crackling fire and listening to the pounding surf.</p>
<p>I kept that brick on my kitchen window sill for years, and you can imagine the symbolism it held for me—and not just reminding me of my loss. For it also symbolized for me that something solid was salvaged from the wreck of my house (and of my family, which suffered massive emotional destruction). Seeing it gave me resolve, comfort, inspiration.<span id="more-6206"></span></p>
<p>Objects in your novels can do likewise for your characters when you tie them in with key events in their past.</p>
<p>So you can start, perhaps, with an object that serves as a key motif in your story, then try to take it further. Explore this object in your mind and see what ideas it sparks. We discussed <a title="How to Come Up with Motifs in Your Novel" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/12/10/how-to-come-up-with-motifs-in-your-novel/">last week </a>about using word associations. Think of emotional associations you can generate for this object (for your character) that will serve your plot and your character’s goal. What kind of object can symbolize persistence for him? Or represent an obstacle? What note would your character write and stick on his fridge to keep him going?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Secondary Characters Can Introduce a Motif</h2>
<p>I try to come up with at least four or five motifs for every novel I write. I think of an object or two to work with, as well as a few key words or phrases that I have characters repeat either in speech or in their heads or both. Often a secondary character who serves as an ally to the protagonist will be the one to impart words of wisdom and advice, and this is a good opportunity to come up with a special phrase (and if possible, associated with some object) that can then be an important motivator for the protagonist.</p>
<p>In my sweet historical Western romance <a title="Colorado Promise on Kindle" href="http://www.amazon.com/Colorado-Promise-Front-Range-ebook/dp/B00GAPWPRK/" target="_blank"><em>Colorado Promise</em></a> (written under my pen name Charlene Whitman), I had a secondary character tell my protagonist that people in their town had a saying (I found this via my research, and it was perfect for the motif I had in mind for my book): “Bloom where you’re planted.” Since I had my botany-loving heroine take out west a special plant she loved, I repeated the motif and symbolism of both the plant (object) and the concept (growth, thriving, withering, adaptation) in various scenes, including the last wrap-up scene, which shows her finally planting the small tree in Colorado soil so it can “bloom where it’s planted.”</p>
<p>So think about a secondary ally character that can give advice or insight in a way that will introduce or reinforce a motif in your story.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Motifs Add Richness to Characters</h2>
<p>In my novel <a title="Intended for Harm by C. S. Lakin on Kindle" href="http://www.amazon.com/Intended-Harm-C-S-Lakin-ebook/dp/B0077HCUTI/" target="_blank"><em>Intended for Harm</em></a>, I gave each of my seven main POV characters a motif. Each character was developed around a natural element. Jake was wood, Leah was water, Reuben was rock, Simon was fire, Levi was metal, Dinah was air, and so on. From this idea came multiple levels of motifs. Simon had a fiery temper. He smoked all the time. He embodied anger due to the specific hurt and rejection he suffered. He set the bed on fire. Reuben, the firstborn son, was the rock of the family. He loved to rock climb. He was also the big obstacle (rock) in the way for his mother. I had a great time playing one element off another. For Leah (water) was the only one who could calm Simon and take the fire out of him, whereas Simon’s “fire” kept setting his father (wood) aflame with anger.</p>
<p>This may seem way over the top, but to me, using these elements as rich motifs and symbols helped me write what I feel is my best novel. These elements, please note, were not randomly chosen. They inspired some of the characters’ traits, but they worked purposefully in my story. Otherwise I wouldn’t have used them.</p>
<p>So don’t choose random objects or words for motifs just because they’re catchy or unusual. Motifs need to serve the plot, and tie in carefully with your themes.</p>
<p>Think about your characters and their personalities. Is there an object that can emphasize a key trait? Give insight into your character? Something they look at or hold that keeps them going, keeps them plodding despite pain and opposition to their goal?</p>
<p>If you take the time to bring these motifs into your story, you won’t regret it. Your plot might not necessitate a motif, but I highly encourage you to consider building this pillar of novel construction. If done well, it can only help to make your novel more solid, substantial, and memorable.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">And . . . It&#8217;s a Wrap!</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, we’ve now covered all twelve key pillars of novel construction! You have below all your inspection checklists. Print them out and use them to closely examine your novel structure. If you can answer all 144 sets of questions to your satisfaction (and be hard on yourself!), your novel will bear the weight of scrutiny. With twelve strong, solid pillars, you can&#8217;t help but build a lasting, memorable novel.</p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks of this year, I’m going to review some key points about each pillar and share some last insights on this whole topic of novel construction. Be sure to bring any questions you have and share what has helped you the most in this course this year.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on motifs? Have you come up with a great one or two for your novel? If so, share what it is and why and how it works in your story.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today&#8217;s guest post is from Mike Monaco, of Author&#8217;s Marketing Pro:</em></p>
<p>Blockbuster movies based on books, such as <em>The Hunger Games</em>, make authors think about how they too can turn self-published books into movies. The studio trend towards self-published material is something savvy authors can capitalize on, if they hope to see their stories on the big screen.</p>
<p>At Author’s Marketing Pro, I work closely with both authors and movie producers. Instead of focusing on <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers, movie studios are increasingly interested in self-published material. Both <em>Wool</em> by Hugh Howey and <em>The Martian </em>by Andy Weir were self-published books later sold to Twentieth-Century Fox to be turned into movies. These books garnered the producer’s attention by first becoming bestsellers on Amazon.com.  It was only after this that they became New York Times bestsellers.<span id="more-6166"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Know Your Audience</h2>
<p>Aside from having an original and compelling story, the best thing an author can do to increase his chances of attracting studio attention is to know his audience. For example, authors of children’s books should consider their target audience when marketing their book. They should focus on factors proven to increase book sales—emphasizing cities with a large population of children and parents of a certain income and education level. They could create a partnership with a toy store that sells children’s books. This kind of product placement will increase their chance of sales because it allows them to better reach their readers. Similarly, finding the right producer for specific content is the key to success.</p>
<p>When I worked in the literary department at The William Morris Agency, we complied lists of studios and producers and noted which type of content they produced. Every time a client wrote a script or a book, we used this list to match the content with specific producers and studio executives who produced similar content. Making a list is not enough; it must be updated frequently because tastes and trends often change.</p>
<p>At Author’s Marketing Pro, we make it a point to hold weekly meetings with studio executives and movie producers to stay current. Studio tastes often change—most are dictated by behind-the-scenes trends in Hollywood. For example, one month we received two separate requests for female driven action pieces from Fox Studios. Although these producers specialize in the action genre, they were looking for something very specific—<em>Taken </em>with a female lead and a female <em>Captain Phillips</em>—because these types stories had been selling well. This relates back to the idea of knowing which audience and studios will be most receptive to each genre. Authors should do their research to increase their chance of success.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Get Connected</h2>
<p>Having a good inside connection to the movie studios will also increase chances of selling the book to a studio. But even that is not a guarantee; movie studios receive tens of thousands of scripts each year. Most sales are dictated by the current market environment—passing fads and popular trends play a large role in what studios want to produce and when. In boils down to a numbers game. The most useful thing an author can do is to market their work specifically to studios and producers that produce similar content.</p>
<p>Authors should not create material for a specific studio; instead, they should find the right studio for their material. Most studios prefer to work with creative content in its original form, which allows them to take cinematic liberty with the work. Most producers buy the movie rights to the book and hire a professional scriptwriter or a team of screenwriters to better tailor the story for the silver screen. For example, Fox Studios hired T. S. Nowlin, Noah Oppenheim, and Grant Pierce Meyers to write the screenplay for James Dashner’s <em>The Maze Runner. </em>Clearly, writing a screenplay to accompany a book is not a useful endeavor for authors hoping to sell their books to movie studios.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Be Prepared; Be Persistent</h2>
<p>Instead, authors can increase their success rates by marketing their work to movie studios and producers with similar content. Authors should not take rejection personally—it is a numbers game, and there are many factors involved. Unfortunately, many clients I have dealt with throughout my career give up before they even start. Authors should be prepared to face rejection while at the same time maintaining confidence in the value of their work.</p>
<p>Just as having a <em>New York Times</em> best seller does not guarantee success in Hollywood, being self-published does not exclude authors from the movie world. Now more than ever, producers are open to buying self-published books. For example, Hugh Howey’s book <em>Wool</em> started as a 99-cent e-book but eventually made his career. Although it may seem like a pipe dream, smart self-published authors can successfully sell their work to top movie studios and see their stories played out on the big screen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now, don’t get all hot and bothered by the expression “participial phrase.” Something that is <em>participial</em> has to do with the part of speech that is a participle. What’s a participle? Well, it’s complicated. Let’s just say it reminds me of a photon—which can be both a particle and a wave. In similar fashion, a participle can be a verb and an adjective. How? By forming a phrase with a verb, you create a kind of adjective that modifies (affects, alters, describes) a noun.</p>
<p>Okay, enough with the grammar lesson. It will make more sense once you read on.</p>
<p>One telltale sign of an inexperienced writer is the overuse of participial phrases to begin a sentence. Participial phrases are easily identified because they almost always begin with a verb that ends in <em>ing </em>or<em> ed</em>. If the participle is present tense, it will dependably end in <em>ing</em>. Likewise, a regular past participle will end in a consistent <em>ed</em>. Irregular past participles, unfortunately, conclude in all kinds of ways.<span id="more-4905"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Writing in longhand, Steinbeck wrote <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> in five months.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Writing in longhand” is a participial phrase that modifies <em>wrote</em>. As modifiers, participial phrases can be a convenient way to add information, especially to downplay less interesting or pertinent information. In this example, the participial phrase conveys significant information. But in a paragraph like the following, ask yourself how much of the information delivered through the participial phrases is necessary to the narrative.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seething with anger, Jennifer stormed into the kitchen. Slamming the door, she shouted for her mother. Finding her in the living room, she demanded, “How could you? Telling Mrs. Olson about my crush on Jimmy.”</li>
</ul>
<p>See which of the two following examples you think is more concise and less clunky:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Eaten by mosquitoes</em>, we wished that we had made hotel, not campsite, reservations.</li>
<li>We wished we had stayed in a hotel instead of a campsite. The mosquitoes ate us alive.</li>
</ul>
<p>How about this?:</p>
<ul>
<li>The water drained slowly in the pipe <em>clogged with dog hair</em>.</li>
<li>The pipe was so clogged with dog hair, the water barely drained.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see how awkward using these participial phrases are. I sometimes see manuscripts that are chock-full of them (Interesting aside: <em>chock-full</em> comes from the Middle English word that means “to choke.” So don’t let these phrases choke your writing).</p>
<p>Some editors encourage writers to avoid participial phrases altogether. That seems a bit extreme. But it’s a good practice to review your writing for any unnecessary participles and remove them, or find another way to convey that important piece of the narrative.</p>
<p>If you’re a photon, you can decide if you want to be a particle or a wave. If you’re a writer, you can decide if you want to turn verbs into adjective phrases. Sometimes it’s not a good idea.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Motifs are powerful elements that writers can take advantage of when constructing their novels. But few novelists ever give thought to adding motifs. They might do so subconsciously or inadvertently, but I’d like to encourage you to take some time and deliberately construct some motifs so that they serve as superglue in your story.</p>
<p>We looked briefly <a title="Motifs for Cohesion and Depth" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/12/03/motifs-for-cohesion-and-depth/">last week </a>at what a motif is, and how it differs from theme. However, the best way to bring a motif into your story is to tie it intrinsically into your theme. We looked at <em>The Hunger Games</em> and saw that not only does author Collins use an actual object or thing—the mockingjay itself, and the metal pin Katniss wears—the “song” of the mockingjay is used symbolically. The characters adopt the bird as a symbol for their revolution, and so the object and the theme are bound together.<span id="more-6194"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Generating Ideas for Motifs</h2>
<p>Once you work to develop the themes in your novel, you can create some motifs. Think for a moment about your theme, what your story is <em>really</em> about (using <a title="More Ways Novelists Can Benefit from Mind Mapping" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2013/10/14/more-ways-novelists-can-benefit-from-mind-mapping/">mind mapping</a> can help with this!). What images come to mind that might represent your novel? I’ve talked at length about<a title="How Novelists Can Create Image Systems for their Story" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2013/10/16/how-novelists-can-create-image-systems-for-their-story/"> image systems</a> and why they’re helpful for novelists. When creating an image system, one thing that might help is to <a title="How Novelists Can Create Image Systems for their Story" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2013/10/16/how-novelists-can-create-image-systems-for-their-story/">envision a movie poster</a> for your novel.</p>
<p>Ask: What key moment in your entire story would best be shown on your poster? What <a title="Color to Shape Your Novel" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2013/10/30/color-to-shape-your-novel/">colors and objects</a> would be shown? What would the characters be wearing, holding, doing? By imagining this movie poster, you might get some ideas for strong symbols that you can work into your novel, even if you’ve already written your first draft. The great thing about motifs is you can add them in after you think you’re done with your novel.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Come Up with an Object</h2>
<p>Think about your protagonist. Imagine one object she owns that is special to her. Maybe it’s a gift someone gave her that has great significance. Maybe it’s a shell she found on the beach on an important day in her life. You can find a place to introduce this motif-object early on in the book, then show it again a few times at important moments in your story, and then bring it into the final scene in some symbolic way. All your character may have to do is pick up the shell from off the table and look at it and think about it. She might perhaps recall the pivotal day she found it, and how she felt back then, and how she’s changed since then. That is a very effective use of a motif.</p>
<p>Objects can spur not just memory but powerful emotion, so if you have an object connected to a very important moment in a character’s past (whether something painful or joyful), you can then springboard from there to infuse this object with deep meaning.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Move from Object to Concept</h2>
<p>To take it further, using the shell as an example, you could have multiple connections with this object so that not just the shell itself is a symbol or triggers a memory. Perhaps a concept can be formed around the object and brought out. What can a shell represent? Maybe you choose a barnacle that clings tenaciously to a rock to survive, but the harsh waves have broken it free from the rock, and now the creature inside is dead. If you have a character whose life has been shattered by a horrific event, and she’s now lost and floundering, dying inside, that shell can take on heavy symbolism.</p>
<p>What if you choose a sand dollar (I use one in my novel <a title="Someone to Blame on Kindle" href="http://www.amazon.com/Someone-Blame-Susanne-Lakin-ebook/dp/B003TFE8MO/" target="_blank"><em>Someone to Blame</em></a> as a motif), which is sometimes thought of as a symbol of hope, or to represent redemption, salvation, or restoration of faith? Or you could choose an oyster, which creates a beautiful pearl due to a speck of sand irritating its tender flesh. If your character can “relate” in some way to this shell—if it can reflect or represent something significant to her—you have a powerful motif. An oyster is pretty ugly to look at, but inside a thing of beauty is created out of pain. Right there can be found a lot of symbolism for a variety of story types.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Reinforce the Motif</h2>
<p>Take that last idea one step further. If a character feels ugly, unworthy of love, and then is given a string of pearls by the man who comes to love her, this reinforces the motif.</p>
<p>A client of mine had a weak title for her novel, and also needed something to superglue her story to take it to a higher level. She had an early scene showing her main character, a young Russian girl, who was given a cheap bracelet by her drunk mother’s unfaithful lover. Angry at her pathetic lot in life, this girl throws down the bracelet and breaks the links of the chain. Her life at this point is shattered. By adding a scene near the end of the book showing her adoptive mother in the US giving her a fine quality link bracelet to represent her love for her new daughter, the symbolism is brought out. The title was changed to <a title="Scattered Links on Kindle" href="http://www.amazon.com/Scattered-Links-Michelle-Weidenbenner-ebook/dp/B00HP3X6R4/" target="_blank"><em>Scattered Links</em></a> (author Michelle Weidenbenner), in order to drive home this motif of the bracelet and the links. The word <em>link</em> also becomes charged due to its association with the character being linked to new family members and friends, and breaking and repairing the links to her past. As a result, this good novel became a great one, and went on to win some prestigious awards.</p>
<p>So spend some time thinking about your protagonist. What is her biggest emotional issue? What is <a title="Why, Why, Why?" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2013/07/01/why-why-why/">the lie she believes </a>about herself and can’t get past? What is her <a title="Getting to the Core of Character Motivation" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2013/12/02/getting-to-the-core-of-character-motivation/">core need</a>? Can you brainstorm a list of ten or so items in her life or past that could be symbolic for her?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Freewriting and Word Association</h2>
<p>One thing you can do is a word-association exercise. Write down an emotion or thematic component from your novel, such as grief or forgiveness. Then <a title="Ways Writers Can Spark Creativity" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2013/06/03/ways-writers-can-spark-creativity/" target="_blank">freewrite </a>all the words and images that come to your mind without censoring what you write. Picture in your head your character grieving. Where is she? What does she see? What does she touch or hold? What comforts her—a song, a picture, a place?</p>
<p>When finished, go over your list and see if you can grab two or three of these items and find ways to give them a place in some scenes. Perhaps your character can find this object. Or see it in a store window. The possibilities are endless, but the key to all this is 1) it must have emotional significance for the character 2) it should somehow tie in with your themes, and 3) it should be simple and clear in its symbolism.</p>
<p>Let’s say you have freedom as an important theme. You may have chosen “bird” as one of the words that came to mind when freewriting. A bird is a common symbol for freedom, and, hence, a good one (using universal symbols that many people share is a good thing). A caged bird represents imprisonment (on any level—actual, emotional, etc.).</p>
<p>Do you remember the best seller <em>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</em>? I thought it was pretty corny, but it sold more than a million copies and topped the <em>New York Times</em> best-seller list for thirty-eight weeks. It was even made into a movie. The novella featured a seagull named Jonathan (who knows why—perhaps to symbolize the “ordinary man”) who is a member of a flock in which individuality is frowned upon. Jonathan finds himself a loner and an outcast. After performing feats of tremendous courage and skill, he is expelled from the flock. This gives him the freedom to develop his skills, and in so doing he reaches a heaven of sorts. The lessons that Jonathan learns in his travels reflect both a greater peace of mind and a freedom to be himself.</p>
<p>Although this book was an allegory (and a bit over-the-top preachy, to me—but hey, that was the 70s!), featuring a young seagull&#8217;s efforts to rise above the ordinary, it can teach us something about the power of motifs and symbols.</p>
<p>You don’t have to go whole-hog into allegory to make powerful points in your novels, however. Just using a few well-developed and meaningful motifs can add that cohesion and depth your novel might be lacking. Why not give it a try?</p>
<p>What is your main theme for your novel? Can you come up with one object to use as a motif? How can you expand that to other levels? Want to share in the comments?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today&#8217;s guest post is by author Simone Collins:</em></p>
<p>One of the best ways aspiring authors can develop successful writing careers is to listen to and apply advice from successful authors. Regardless of genre, or whether they write fiction and nonfiction, authors starting out in this brave new world of publishing can benefit from the generous sharing of tips by today’s pros.</p>
<p>While creating a course on online authorship for my website, I interviewed a wide variety of authors and editors to glean their top tips for aspiring authors. Some of their advice surprised me—and might surprise you too. I have summarized my favorite nuggets of wisdom below. I hope you find them as helpful as I do.<span id="more-6087"></span></p>
<p><strong>From Wool Series Author Hugh Howey:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Utilize Amazon and Kindle Direct Publishing. </strong>Hugh Howey is the ultimate poster child for Kindle Direct Publishing. He used the platform to rocket to success without the help of publishers and agents, and had to think very carefully about signing on with Simon &amp; Schuster, as the success he experienced through KDP was so great that publishers had relatively little to offer.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Use this platform to make your work available to the masses. It is one of the most efficient means by which your work can reach a vast audience with minimal cost and connections.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Write Work that Sparks Online Conversation and Excitement. </strong>Howey did not encounter wild success with his Wool series just because he happened to publish it through KDP. His stories are compelling, well written, and incredibly good at sparking online interest and dialog, especially because he incorporated feedback that readers provided into each new chapter he released.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you write something worth sharing and talking about, you will be far more likely to experience organic growth, and your initial readers may do much of your marketing for you. Strongly consider releasing your early works chapter by chapter and working with your fans and readers to build a collaboratively-shaped novel in which they have significant emotional investment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make Yourself Available to Readers through Social Media. </strong>Despite his high profile, Howey is incredibly accessible. By making yourself accessible to your readers and developing meaningful connections with them, you are more likely to gain evangelists for your books who will happily encourage others to read them and give copies to their friends.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> From Best-Selling Author A. J. Jacobs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>If You Lack Confidence, Pretend You Have It Anyway. </strong>When not turning out fascinating fiction books, A. J. Jacobs may make regular radio appearances and write for high-profile publications, but he nevertheless understands how intimidating it is to commence new undertakings as an author.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> Jacobs chose to adopt the “fake it till you make it” approach, pretending he had all the confidence he needed to pitch ideas to publications and publishers and undertake daunting research tasks.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Chances are you have adopted this strategy from time to time yourself and experienced positive results. Fake more confidence in your writing and activities, such as promotion and research, and inquiries will become far less burdensome.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Network, Network, Network. </strong>Jacobs is a pro at utilizing his network and attends as many parties and events as he can. The more people you meet, and the more people who meet you, the more likely you are to develop a connection that will help you write, finish, edit, publish, and promote your writing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approach Subjects with a Blank Slate. </strong>Jacobs has a wonderful way of approaching the nonfiction subjects he writes about in fresh and fascinating ways. His secret to success lies in approaching them with a completely open mind and dropping his previous biases and misconceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By approaching any subject, be it fiction or nonfiction, with the same wide-eyed wonder and open mind, you too will be more likely to expose well-worn subjects in a refreshing new light.</p>
<h3>From Best-Selling Crime Fiction and Romance Author Judith Arnold:</h3>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Listen to Your Readers. </strong>Judith Arnold has chosen to follow in the path of Charles Dickens and many great authors before her by listening carefully to her readers’ suggestions and thoughts when writing new work.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Like it or not, you as an author are selling a product to people. If you do not adapt that product to suit their needs, you may have a much harder time boosting sales.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get around Exclusivity Clauses with Pseudonyms. </strong>As an author who occasionally works with traditional publishers, Arnold has learned important lessons in how to contend with their sometimes inconvenient demands. One such demand involves publishers’ requests to gain exclusive rights to publish future works written by an author.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Judith found that by using a pseudonym, she could give exclusive rights to works by that name to a publisher while maintaining the right to publish works under a different name should she like to take a different route.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cater to Niche Audiences. </strong>Though Arnold acknowledges that niche authors would not have been likely to support themselves with their work thirty years ago, it is now more possible than ever to find an audience with highly targeted work.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By catering to a specific niche audience online, you may have an easier time building initial traction and interest in your book,  as the audience in question has fewer books marketed to them and is more forgiving of no-name authors and first-time novelists.</p>
<h3>From Nonfiction History Writer John Ferling:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do Your Own Research. </strong>John Ferling learned the hard way that it is best to do all your own research when he depended on an aide to conduct research for one of his nonfiction history books, only to discover that he needed to repeat all the work again himself.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You are the only person you can depend on to produce research and writing that is true to your style and quality standards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evaluate Resources before Committing to an Idea. </strong>Nonfiction books (and, to a lesser extent, their fictional counterparts) require extensive research. If relevant information is difficult to access, you will have a difficult time finishing your work. Ferling has plenty of colleagues who were never able to finish certain history books they hoped to publish because the libraries they needed to access for research resided in entirely different continents, and each research trip took immense time and expense.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Before choosing a new subject, Ferling evaluates whether or not he actually has the resources necessary to cover it. He avoids subjects that would require extensive (and expensive) travel or that lack an adequate amount of primary research material.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ferling understands that to be compelling, a nonfiction book must present a significant amount of information that <em>cannot</em> be readily found online. This means he must find information that may be very difficult for others to access. Before committing to a topic, make sure you have access to the key primary sources that will enable you to contribute something of substance to your chosen subject area.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Even with Nonfiction, Give Readers Colorful Narratives. </strong>To keep his history novels engaging, Ferling spends time discussing the character and personalities of the people he writes about. In moderation, he also offers some speculation as to what might have driven their decisions and behavior, adds a narrative, and includes insights from multiple perspectives.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By adding these additions to nonfiction, you can better package information in evocative stories that your readers will actually remember and share.</p>
<h3>From Fiction Author Catherine Ryan Hyde:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Write, Write, Write. </strong>Catherine Ryan Hyde made a point of publishing about one book a year, even though she was not able to initially sell them all to publishers. This commitment required hours of draining work with no promise of payoff, but the long-term benefits Ryan Hyde experienced are notable. By having a backlog of unpublished books that were ready to go, Catherine was able to focus on speaking and traveling for three years later in her career, once she had experienced significant success.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do not assume your rejected works will never find a place. Do not let their presence slow you down. Simply create more.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get Used to (Repeated) Failure. </strong>Ryan Hyde was rejected again and again&#8211;not just from publishers but from small, relatively-unknown literary journals. Rather than let this get her down, she got used to it and kept trying.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Failure and rejection is the only sure thing you will experience as an author. Rather than let that get you down, accept it as an inevitability and regular occurrence on the path to success.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Social Media for Relationship Building, Not Advertising. </strong>Many authors who are new to social media assume each account they open serves as a place to drop links to their work and catch attention. Most quickly learn that nobody cares about promotional posts. Social networks exist for socializing.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Catherine Ryan Hyde uses social media to develop relationships with her readers, who then in turn share her work and books with their friends in a meaningful manner. Follow in her footsteps and you will be far more likely to draw attention to your work and build meaningful, rewarding relationships along the way.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Gist</strong></h2>
<p>These tips are only some of many given to me by the authors I interviewed. If I were to distill them all into one nugget of wisdom, it would be this: Writing a successful book today is more about maintaining a dialogue than it is about giving a speech. To catch others’ attention, you must befriend, listen to, and work with your audience and use your unique personality, perspective, and/or access to fresh information to stand apart from the crowd.</p>
<p>What advice would you add? Do you think any of it is out of date? And do you agree that readers should play such a prominent role in an author’s work? Share in the comments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">There seems to be some confusion over the words <em>alternate</em> and <em>alternative</em>. Can they be used interchangeably? Does <em>alternative</em> involve only two choices? The confusion is understandable since both words serve multiple parts of speech.</p>
<p><em>Alternate</em> can be a verb, noun, or adjective. When used as a verb, the last syllable is accented and the final <em>a</em> is long.</p>
<ul>
<li>Verb: Joan and I alternated sitting in the front seat to keep our motion sickness under control. (Meaning: took turns)</li>
<li>Noun: The alternates to the political convention were vocal in their opposition to platform’s taxation plank. (Meaning: substitutes)</li>
<li>Adjective: We took an alternate route to the museum due to construction.(Meaning: another option/choice)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Alternative</em> can be a noun or an adjective.</p>
<ul>
<li>Noun: My morning alternative to coffee is a headache. (Meaning: a choice—caffeine or headache)</li>
<li>Adjective: <em>Lolapalooza</em> began as a showcase for alternative bands in the early 1990s. (Meaning: another choice, option)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some argue that <em>alternative</em> refers only to two choices. Such reasoning is a logical progression from the word’s Latin root <em>alter</em>, meaning “the other of two.” But there is nearly universal agreement that <em>alternative</em> can refer to multiple options. Both <em>Merriam-Webster</em> and the <em>American Heritage Dictionary</em> define <em>alternative</em> as involving two or more choices. So writing “The alternatives available to a Starbuck’s customer are limitless” is correct, if not overwhelming.</p>
