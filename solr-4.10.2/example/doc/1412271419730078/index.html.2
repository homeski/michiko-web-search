If you’re good at breaking complex processes and diagrams into simple terms anyone can understand, you may want to consider the lucrative field of technical writing.</p> <p>This type of writing normally involves creating documentation for technical processes, software and systems. I began my career as a technical writer working in the information technology field, where I noticed how many companies around me needed custom diagrams, technical content and how-to guides. However, writers aren’t limited to IT companies; all sorts of businesses and organizations, from colleges to web development startups, need their services.</p> <p>If you’re keen to explore the world of <a title="Technical Writing: How to Break Into this Lucrative World" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/technical-writing/" target="_blank">technical writing</a>, you’ll need to develop your skills, establish contacts and find clients. Here’s how to get started.</p> <h2><b>Who needs technical writers?</b></h2> <p>Many types of businesses need technical writing services. Schools, including community colleges and distance learning institutions, may need support with curriculum development. For example, an online school may want to offer a course on how to effectively use Microsoft Excel. Businesses may need support manuals for software or articles about how best to use their products.</p> <p>Many vendors, academic institutions and government agencies need <a title="What Is a Whitepaper? [FAQs]" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-whitepaper-faqs" target="_blank">white papers</a>. These academic documents explain technical topics and often follow the same methodology as a how-to guide, but they may require additional information such as citations.</p> <p>You could also become a technical editor, though most of these roles require more experience, as you’ll need to identify mistakes in technical concepts, diagrams and pedagogy in addition to grammar and syntax.</p> <h2><b>Breaking in is easier with a mentor</b></h2> <p>The first step to building a lucrative career in technical writing is breaking in. Like other types of writing, it can be challenging, but it’s not impossible.</p> <p>As a reviewer and paralegal, <a title="Allison Bishop" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~twitter.com/AlliBish" target="_blank">Allison Bishop</a> did a lot of report writing and other document preparation work. While researching and reading articles, she became interested in writing them herself. After contacting editors at multiple publishing companies, she connected with an author who showed her the ropes of the profession. Within two months, she contributed to two technical books that were published this year.</p> <p><b>“Breaking in was easier once I had found a mentor who could assist me,”</b> said Bishop. She was able to make new contacts in the field and convince editors to offer her trial assignments. “Once I showed my editors that I was reliable, handed in my work on time and produced great work, I was offered more to do.”</p> <p>Any aspiring technical writer can follow Bishop’s lead: As you build your network and make contacts within the field, approach one or two about helping you learn the business.</p> <h2><b>Develop a technical writing resume and portfolio</b></h2> <p>Create a technical writing resume and <a title="7 Great Portfolio Sites for Freelance Writers (And Most are Free)" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/freelance-portfolio-sites/" target="_blank">portfolio</a> featuring samples of your work. Since you’re new to technical writing and likely don’t have previous work in the field, highlight as much relevant experience as possible. Use <a title="Sample Technical Writer Resume" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~news.dice.com/2011/01/01/sample-resume-technical-writer/" target="_blank">sample resumes</a> <a title="Sample Technical Writer Resume" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.careerfaqs.com.au/careers/sample-resumes-and-cover-letters/technical-writer-sample-resume/" target="_blank">like these</a> to guide you as you present your past work in the best possible light. Consider focusing on a specific niche, such as health care or software, that builds on your education or work experience.</p> <p>You’ll also need to create samples of your work. Don’t let the fact that no one’s ever hired you for a technical writing job stop you!</p> <p>“Since I was just entering the field, I created sample technical writings so that potential hiring managers could evaluate my work,” said Bishop. Volunteer to help a friend or contact with a project, or create your own. Perhaps you could rewrite support documents for a well-known tool, such as the iPad <a title="Apple Support Manuals" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~support.apple.com/manuals/" target="_blank">how-to manual</a>. Or develop a user guide for a product you enjoy, like Tim Murphy did with <a title="The Mint Manual" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=225673&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=243758" target="_blank">The Mint Manual</a>.</p> <p>You could also review new products on your blog or write guest posts for technical sites, like this post I wrote about <a title="Protect yourself from Creepware!" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~scitechconnect.elsevier.com/protect-creepware/" target="_blank">using software to provide security</a>. Add your work to your portfolio and share it on LinkedIn and <a title="4 Mistakes Even the Best Writers Make on Twitter" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/mistakes-writers-make-twitter/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to develop your personal brand and show potential clients what you can do.</p> <h2><b>Combine job boards with networking</b></h2> <p>Now that you have a resume and portfolio to highlight your experience, you need to <a title="A Step-by-Step Guide for Going After Clients You Really Want" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/going-after-clients-you-really-want/" target="_blank">find clients</a>. Technical writing jobs are generally posted with other writing opportunities, so keep an eye on your favorite <a title="9 Online Gold Mines for Finding Paid Freelance Writing Jobs" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/find-freelance-writing-jobs/" target="_blank">freelance writing job sites</a>. You can set up alerts on many of these sites to email you when technical writing jobs are posted.</p> <p>However, you’ll also want to go beyond the job boards to find potential opportunities. “I contacted organizations directly and sent them my technical writing resume,” said Bishop. “Once they saw that I could create what they needed, they hired me immediately.”</p> <p><b>Develop a network of contacts at organizations or firms that require technical writers.</b> First, look within your existing network for people who might be able to help &#8212; do you know anyone who works at the types of organizations or businesses we discussed above? Get in touch and share your portfolio and resume.</p> <p>Look at the tools and products you use on a daily basis, and check out their documentation; could their creators use help with a FAQ, troubleshooting guidelines, how-to manual or other technical writing? Contact the company to pitch your services.</p> <p>Consider attending conferences or technology-focused events in your area to help connect with other potential clients. Always be on the lookout for ways to expand your network.</p> <p>Whether you’re looking for a full-time technical writing role or freelance work, you’ll need to work hard to master your niche and develop an active network. However, there’s a lot of work out there for technical writers &#8212; good luck with your new specialty!</p> <p><b>Have you tried technical writing?

See below to enter and you could win a chance to be interviewed in February or April 2015.</i></p> <p>When we talk about <a title="Author Platform: Here’s What All the Fuss Is About" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/author-platform/" target="_blank">author platform</a>, many writers think about print media such as books and blog posts. Based on my own experience building my own author platform, an audio component such as an Internet radio show makes a great addition.</p> <p><b>A radio show adds a different dimension to your writing and generates interest in you and your book.</b> When people read your website and <a title="7 More Writing Blogs That Want Your Guest Posts" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/blogs-to-pitch-guest-posts/" target="_blank">guest posts</a>, they are “reading your voice” and imagining what you sound like. On a radio show, your fans can hear and “feel” you much more directly than they can through an article.</p> <p>In addition, a radio show helps you build public speaking and media credits. If you’re looking to get on syndicated news, local radio and news channels and even national television, a radio show will help you share your personality with producers.</p> <p>Sound like something you might want to do? Here’s how to develop your own radio show.</p> <h2><b>My experience as a radio show host</b></h2> <p>My global radio show, “Giving Voice to Your Story,” went live in July 2013 as part of the Creating Calm Network Broadcast Group. I had already established myself as a blogger, but I wanted to create a more solid online platform and prepare for the release of my memoir, even though the publishing date was over a year and a half away.</p> <p>I connected online with non-fiction authors and memoirists I liked and to my surprise, many wholeheartedly wanted to be interviewed! It wasn’t long before I’d built a following. Within five months, I was able to bring on board noted authors such as Julia Cameron, author of <a title="The Artist’s Way" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585421464/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1585421464&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=UKLC43ZQCSGAAXVF" target="_blank"><i>The Artist’s Way</i></a>, and Linda Gray Sexton, <a title="Linda Gray Sexton" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582437440/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1582437440&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=4NVG4XLMAFXLFV2U" target="_blank">memoirist</a> and daughter of the Pulitzer-prize-winning poet Anne Sexton.</p> <p>Since I launched my radio show, people have started recognizing me as an expert because I associate myself with expert authors.</p> <h2><b>Planning your radio show</b></h2> <p>As when writing an article, blog post or novel, the first thing you do is plan the subject matter of your radio show. Keep in mind that the topic should be something about which you are knowledgeable and feel passionate about, and one that potential book-buyers will be interested in.</p> <p>Your show might include chapter-by-chapter readings of your book, how-to tips or interviews.  In my experience, <b>listeners are a lot less interested in stories than they are in the lessons they can learn from them.</b> Talk about the life lessons you learned or share advice from your experience, and then allude to your book, which of course goes into more detail.</p> <p>On my blog as well as on my show, I talk about various craft issues related to memoir such as the voice of experience versus the voice of innocence, how to break the silence and write about challenging emotions or painful parts of life, or how to write about uncomfortable issues so that one’s memoir doesn’t read like a journal, but an actual story.</p> <p>I refer to specific scenes to talk about these issues. For example, I finally broke my silence to write about<a title="Memoir Writing Techniques that Help You Voice Your Truth and Break the Silence" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.givingavoicetothevoicelessbook.com/2014/11/08/voice-painful-story-writing-memoir-use-narrative-summary/" target="_blank"> a bullying experience</a> while serving in the Israel Defense Forces, and my next step is to broadcast a “break the silence” radio episode. I shared these insights on a recent LinkedIn discussion along with a previous link to the show and readers were not only grateful, but shared their thoughts behind the challenges. The comments quickly turned into a great discussion and helped create a supportive community.</p> <p>Aim for a show between 15 and 60 minutes long. You’ll want people to be able to listen to it in one sitting (or one trip), but you don’t want it to be so short that your listeners will resent the fact they bothered to tune in or download it. Consider adding music to open and close the program. Google “public domain music” or “royalty-free music” for download options.</p> <p>How often you choose to put out a new episode is up to you, but I feel the frequency of a radio show follows the same rules as blog posts: <b>Release a new episode as often as you think you can commit to regularly and faithfully.</b> The shorter the show, the more frequent you can be without overloading your audience.</p> <h2><b>Interested in interviewing guests?</b></h2> <p>You’d be surprised how happy agents are to book one of their authors as a guest on a radio show. You can also put a call out for guests on your social media channels. With <a title="5 Marketing Strategies for Writers Who Hate Promoting Their Own Work" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/marketing-strategies-for-writers/" target="_blank">self-promotion</a> so necessary to book sales, authors are hungry to spread the word about their work.</p> <p>Whenever I finish a great memoir, I immediately connect with the author online and inquire if he or she is interested in being on my show. Almost 99% of the time, the answer is yes. This is how I’ve secured most of my guest appearances. <b>The key is to start with your local community of authors and build your way up.</b> After a while, you’ll build a following and you can quote your number of listeners when you’re approaching bigger-name authors.</p> <h2><b>Essential equipment</b></h2> <p>To broadcast your radio show, you’ll need a few things:</p> <ul> <li><b>A computer or laptop with high-speed Internet connection</b>. The beauty of hosting your own radio show is that you can do it from the comforts of your own home.</li> <li><b>A headset with both headphones and microphone.</b> The benefit to the headset is that you can adjust the distance of the mic from your mouth and it stays there.</li> </ul> <p>That’s it! Easy, right?</p> <h2><b>Broadcasting a show</b></h2> <p><a title="Blog Talk Radio" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.kqzyfj.com/click-7319408-10866550" target="_blank">Blog Talk Radio</a> is the most popular venue for Internet radio and offers an easy start up. There are three tiers of monthly payments, with more benefits as you move up to the account types. There’s also a free account, but it only allows five listeners, so it’s not as useful.</p> <p>The main difference between the three packages ($39, $99 and $249) is the number of shows you can broadcast as well as more promotions. With the $249 package, you can live-stream from any website rather than just on Blog Talk Radio’s site.</p> <p>I’ve made the switch to <a title="Instant Teleseminar" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~instantteleseminar.com/" target="_blank">Instant Teleseminar</a>, which is user-friendly for both the listener and host. My recordings are immediately available after the show, so I can post them on my site for listeners to download.</p> <h2><b>Get ready for your first show</b></h2> <p>Here’s a handy checklist of how to prepare before and during the show:</p> <ul> <li><b>Make sure you’re recording in a quiet place.</b> Microphones pick up strange sounds that can easily distract listeners.</li> <li><b>Write an outline or script for your show before recording. </b>This cuts down on the “ums” and “ahs.”</li> <li><b>If you’re doing a live recording</b> (a show you’ve promoted with listeners tuning in live, rather than one recorded for later download) <b>make sure you’re comfortable with your equipment and software.</b> Practice beforehand so your first live show goes smoothly. Offer listeners a chance during the show to ask questions.</li> </ul> <h2><b>Marketing and promoting your radio show</b></h2> <p>Now that you’ve finished your first episode, you need a home base to fully capitalize on the marketing potential of your episodes. A blog or <a title="An Online Portfolio Can Change Your Career: 10 Writer Websites We Love" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/writer-websites/" target="_blank">writer website</a> is a good option and makes you easier to find. Make sure that your site has the link to your latest show prominently displayed along with your contact information.</p> <p>Since I’m part of a network, the show producers help promote all of the network’s shows. My show appears on its own <a title="Giving Voice to Your Story" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.creatingcalmnetwork.com/giving-voice-to-your-story.html" target="_blank">home page</a> and on the network’s social media channels.</p> <p><b>Promote your show on your own by creating tweets and Facebook posts highlighting different points in the radio show.</b> For example, you could mention a lesson you learned in an unlikely situation, then link to your upcoming episode (or recording) for people to learn more.</p> <p>Make your latest episodes easy to find, and distribute recordings on established networks such as<a title="iTunes" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~apple.com/itunes" target="_blank"> iTunes</a> or <a title="Audible" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.jdoqocy.com/click-7319408-3216228" target="_blank">Audible</a>, which let you upload your recordings for wider distribution. Be sure to include your name and URL at the beginning and end of each recording, and consider crafting a short, catchy promo to share on your networks.</p> <h2><b>Not ready to host your own show?</b></h2> <p>Instead of going it alone, take on a cohost or two. You could either record together for a talk-show-like adventure, or host your own episodes as part of a group show. You’d see many of the same benefits, but without having to record a new episode quite as often.</p> <p><b>If hosting a radio show sounds too daunting, consider being a guest on a show.</b> Choose one that speaks to you. One great way to get started is to check the daily listings over at <a title="Help a Reporter Out" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.helpareporter.com/" target="_blank">Help a Reporter Out</a> (HARO). I see requests for radio show guests almost daily. Subscribe to the daily digest to receive updates on all kinds of media requests. You can also set up a Google Alert for “radio show” and “guests wanted/needed” which you can receive up to several times a day straight to your inbox.</p> <p>Another option is to search for radio shows in your genres. You’ll find lots of them out there, so again, you’ll need to be choosy. Approach the host or producer and ask if he or she has slots for guests for future interviews. It never hurts to ask! As a guest, you’ll still have to prepare for the show, but you’ll be spreading the word about your book, building your brand and creating a following with less pressure than hosting your own show.</p> <p>Hosting your own radio show can be an effective way to round out your online presence while giving you one more way to engage and connect with your audience.

After adding a copy to his cart, he continued shopping. The link to the book&#8217;s sales page includes my Amazon affiliate code, so not only did I earn a royalty from my publisher, but <b>Amazon paid me a commission for the book as well as anything else the visitor bought within 24 hours</b><i>,</i> which in this case included that battery pack.</p> <p>If you haven’t taken advantage of Amazon’s Associates Program to earn royalties from your links to your books &#8212; and other products &#8212; you’ll want to get started.</p> <h2><b>How Amazon Associates Works</b></h2> <p>When you<a title="sign up for Amazon Associates" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/join/landing/main.html" target="_blank"> sign up for Amazon Associates</a>, you&#8217;re paid 4 to 10 percent commission for sales you refer to Amazon using your affiliate links (the URLs that include your unique tracking code). The exact percentage depends on the types of products sold and your sales volume for the month.</p> <p>Of course, you can earn commissions by linking to any product on Amazon (more on that in a moment), but as an author your first goal is to squeeze more profit from your <a title="Publishing Traditionally? 4 Tricks for Maximizing Your Profit" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/publishing-book-maximizing-profit/" target="_blank">book sales</a>. <b>Every time you promote your books on your website or blog, make sure to use your affiliate links.</b></p> <p>Here’s an example for traditionally published authors. Suppose the cover price of your book is $19.95, and Amazon is currently charging $14.95 (their price often changes and its generally below list price). When a visitor clicks the link on your blog and buys a copy from Amazon, you&#8217;ll get at least 59 cents (4 percent) as a commission &#8212; in addition to whatever the royalty is from your publisher.</p> <p>Self-published? If your ebook sells for $5.99 in the Kindle store, you’re probably already earning a royalty of $4.19 (Amazon pays up to 70 percent), which is great. But why not also get an extra 24 cents by linking to your book with your affiliate code to earn a 4 percent commission? And if you sell enough books, you can do even better.</p> <p>For example, if you sell more than six items through your referral links in a month, your commission goes up to 6 percent. Notice I said &#8220;items,&#8221; because the people who buy your books will also buy other things while shopping on Amazon, and you earn a commission on those sales as long as they occur within 24 hours (or longer if the visitor adds an item to her shopping cart and returns to pay later).</p> <p>Some items have set rates, while others’ rates fluctuate based on volume. Here are some examples of the set rates from<a title="Amazon's Advertising Fee Schedule" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/help/operating/advertisingfees" target="_blank"> Amazon&#8217;s Advertising Fee Schedule</a>:</p> <ul> <li>Grocery products: 4 percent</li> <li>Instant video products: 6 percent</li> <li>Headphone products: 6 percent</li> <li>Jewelry products: 10 percent</li> <li>Game downloads: 10 percent</li> </ul> <h2><b>How much money can you earn?</b></h2> <p>I receive a royalty of $1.50 from my publisher for each book I sell, so if I also get a 77-cent affiliate commission (6 percent when Amazon sells my book for $12.95), that&#8217;s a 51 percent boost in revenue per book. I don&#8217;t sell 100 copies weekly like I did back when the book first came out, and most sales now aren&#8217;t through my links, so that extra revenue has dropped to less than 10 dollars each month.</p> <p>On the other hand, after replacing regular links with my affiliate links years ago, <b>I haven&#8217;t had to spend one extra minute to keep making that extra money</b>.</p> <p>Then there are those &#8220;other&#8221; sales. Once I started using this strategy, I was surprised to see that on top of the affiliate income for my books, I was making another $30 monthly in commissions for other items people bought after arriving at Amazon through my links. That too has dropped as sales have declined, but hey, every little bit helps.</p> <p>The payoff can be bigger than my experience indicates. <b>&#8220;On average, I make a few hundred dollars each month from my affiliate account</b>, because every time I link to my books from my website I use an Amazon Associates URL that&#8217;s got a tracking ID attached,” said <a title="How To Self-Publish Your Book Through Amazon" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2014/04/25/how-to-self-publish-your-book-through-amazon/" target="_blank">Paul Jarvis</a> in a post at Forbes. A few hundred dollars a month is a few thousand dollars a year &#8212; not a bad payoff for taking a few minutes to set things up the right way.</p> <h2><b>Playing by Amazon’s rules</b></h2> <p>Authors often think it&#8217;s against the rules to use affiliate links for their own books. It isn&#8217;t. What <i>is</i> against the rules is using your affiliate links when you buy things for <i>yourself</i>. <b>It&#8217;s perfectly okay to make commissions on your books when </b><b><i>other people</i></b><b> buy them.</b> This is true when you<a title="Kindle Publishing: A Step-by-Step Guide for Selling Your Book Through Amazon" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~alexisgrant.com/2014/04/14/kindle-publishing-guide/" target="_blank"> sell Kindle books</a>, too.</p> <p>In response to the question, &#8220;Can I link to my Kindle book via the Amazon Associates program?&#8221;<a title="Amazon KDP Rules" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=A1CT8LK6UW2FXJ" target="_blank"> Amazon says</a>:</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>Yes, the Amazon Associates Program provides vendors specially formatted links to Amazon on their websites in exchange for advertising fees when their visitors follow the links and place an order. Anyone with a website may apply for our Associates Program, although we do have certain requirements that may prevent a site from participating.</i></p> <p>One of those &#8220;certain requirements&#8221; is that you live in an approved state, a list that fortunately includes all but five states. According to the<a title="Associates Program Operating Agreement" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/agreement/" target="_blank"> Associates Program Operating Agreement</a>, the only states where you <i>can&#8217;t</i> participate are Arkansas, Colorado, Maine, Missouri and Rhode Island.</p> <p>If you happen to live in one of those states you&#8217;re out of luck . . . almost. You still can sign up for the<a title="Books-a-Million affiliate program" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.booksamillion.com/affiliates/index.html" target="_blank"> Books-a-Million affiliate program</a> and send your readers to <i>their</i> website to buy your books. You&#8217;ll get a 5 percent commission on sales made within 30 days of the customer using your link to arrive at BooksAMillion.com.</p> <p>Read up on the rest of<a title="Amazon Associates rules" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/agreement/" target="_blank"> Amazon&#8217;s rules</a>. You can&#8217;t use affiliate links in emails or PDFs, for example, and Amazon requires you to disclose on your site or blog that you are &#8220;a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program.&#8221; Getting your affiliate account closed means your extra income stream is gone, and it&#8217;s easy to make a mistake. In fact, I may have used my affiliate link in my newsletters once or twice before realizing this was against the rules.</p> <h2><b>What does the law say?</b></h2> <p>As an advertiser (which is essentially what you become), you also have to be aware of Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations. For example, the<a title="FTC Guidelines" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-staff-revises-online-advertising-disclosure-guidelines/130312dotcomdisclosures.pdf" target="_blank"> FTC Guidelines</a> say you have to disclose the fact that you might receive payment when visitors use your links to buy something, and they provide these more specific suggestions:</p> <ul> <li><i><i>Place the disclosure as close as possible to the triggering claim.</i></i></li> <li><i>Preferably, design advertisements so that &#8220;scrolling&#8221; is not necessary in order to find a disclosure.</i></li> <li><i>Necessary disclosures should not be relegated to &#8220;terms of use&#8221; and similar contractual agreements.</i></li> </ul> <p>A simple disclosure might look something like this:</p> <p><b><i>Disclosure:</i></b><i> This website may be compensated for linking to other sites or for sales of products we link to.</i></p> <p>Some bloggers put a statement at the bottom of each page, while others just provide a link there to a disclosure page that has the more-detailed information. That has apparently been enough for website and blog owners to avoid trouble with the FTC so far, but it also appears that neither practice is in complete compliance with the regulations, so you may have to put that disclosure a bit closer to the links. (I’m not a lawyer, though, so you may want to speak with one to make sure you’re covered.)</p> <p>Of course, you could be <i>very</i> clear and label it &#8220;My affiliate link to my book,&#8221; or even say something like, &#8220;Do me a favor and use this link to check out my book, so I can make a commission if you buy it.&#8221;</p> <h2><b>How to make more money with Amazon Associates</b></h2> <p>It’s possible to make even more affiliate income while promoting your books. One method is to share the sales pages on <a title="How Successful Authors Use Social Media to Sell More Books" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/how-successful-authors-use-social-media-to-sell-more-books/" target="_blank">social media</a> using your affiliate code. This is tricky because it is against Amazon&#8217;s rules to shorten your affiliate URLs and they may be too long for Twitter, or might be shortened automatically on Facebook.</p> <p><b>Fortunately, Amazon provides a way to share your book&#8217;s sales page on Twitter and Facebook while using your affiliate tracking code.</b> Go to your book&#8217;s sales page while logged into your affiliate account, then use the &#8220;share&#8221; tab at the top to post to Twitter or Facebook. Here’s a<a title="HOW TO PUT AMAZON AFFILIATE LINKS ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~amylynnandrews.com/how-to-put-amazon-affiliate-links-on-facebook/" target="_blank"> simple tutorial</a> that walks you through the process.</p> <p>Another way to get an Amazon-approved short link is to search for your book from your Associates home page. See the yellow “Get Link” button? Click the arrow next to it and choose “Shorten URL with amzn.to?”</p> <p>I discovered another creative way to boost your affiliate income <a title="Thread: How to get bigger Amazon checks without selling more books" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://kdp.amazon.com/community/message.jspa?messageID=392866" target="_blank">in a Kindle publishers&#8217; forum</a>. “One thing I&#8217;ve done is post product links to the equipment that I or my fictional hero use in the books. Things like knives, optics, tents and such,” said one user.</p> <p>For example, he says he made an 8 percent commission on a rifle scope that costs over $2,000 &#8212; that&#8217;s more than $160 from one sale through his affiliate link!</p> <p>Letting your book&#8217;s characters sell things for you is a neat trick! Unfortunately,<a title="Thread: How to get bigger Amazon checks without selling more books" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://kdp.amazon.com/community/thread.jspa?threadID=43162" target="_blank"> the consensus of Kindle forum users</a> is that it&#8217;s against the rules to include affiliate links in Kindle books. Many authors get away with it and Amazon has not fully clarified the matter, but <b>a safer strategy might be to have &#8220;character profile&#8221; pages on your website, with affiliate links to each character’s favorite products.</b> You could then link to those profile pages at the end of your book, or link to a &#8220;more information&#8221; page on your site.</p> <p>Finally, your readers probably value your opinion, so why not have a list of your favorite books by other authors on your website or blog? Of course, you&#8217;ll link to all of their books using your Amazon Associates links.</p> <h2><b>Will you join Amazon Associates?</b></h2> <p>The program offers a way to boost your income from book sales.

In each folder, my subfolders keep invoices, news releases and other projects organized. Finding a particular invoice or file quickly is a breeze.</p> <h2><b>2. Check your payments and expenses</b></h2> <p>Now that your client work is organized, look back over 2014 and determine whether you’re missing any payments. Has everyone paid your <a title="The Best Invoicing Systems for Freelancers: A Writer Tries 10 Popular Options" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/best-invoicing-systems-freelancers-writer-tries-10-popular-options/" target="_blank">invoices</a>? If you’re missing any income, now’s a great time to chase it down.</p> <p>Check which clients owe you a 1099 &#8212; anyone who paid you more than $600 will need to send you one. Make a list of 1099s to expect, then mark them off as they come in and keep them in a single folder so they’re organized for you at tax time (or a simple hand-off to your accountant).</p> <p>Track your <a title="Filing Taxes as a Freelancer: 10 Mistakes to Avoid" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/filing-taxes-freelancer-10-mistakes/" target="_blank">business expenses</a> for the year so it’ll be simple to deduct them from your taxes in April. Remember to include office supplies, web hosting fees and advertising costs; there’s a great line-by-line explanation of potential deductions on the <a title="Tax Deductions Guide for Freelancers and the Self-Employed" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://www.freelancersunion.org/blog/2014/02/13/tax-deductions-guide-freelancers-and-self-employed/" target="_blank">Freelancers Union blog</a>.</p> <h2><b>3. Outline your goals for 2015 and create actionable plans</b></h2> <p>Now that you’ve organized this past year, it’s time to look ahead. What do you <a title="Start the New Year Right with These 6 Ambitious Goals for Writers" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/6-ambitious-goals-for-writers/" target="_blank">want to achieve</a> in 2015 &#8212; or to break it down further, in each month or quarter? What do you want your business to look like at this time next year?</p> <p>Let’s say your goal is to contribute an article to Forbes.com. Your plan would include steps like:</p> <ul> <li>Develop a great story idea</li> <li>Write an awesome query</li> <li>Determine who to contact</li> <li>Send the pitch and follow up if necessary</li> <li>Write the article (unless you like to <a title="Guest Post Strategy: Should You Pitch the Editor Before You Write?" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/guest-post-strategy-pitch-editor-write/" target="_blank">write before querying</a>)</li> </ul> <p>Outlining specific, <a title="3 Steps for Creating Meaningful Goals That Will Help You Make Progress as a Writer" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/3-steps-for-creating-meaningful-goals/" target="_blank">meaningful goals</a> and concrete steps to attain them makes taking action that much easier.</p> <h2><b>4. Network with other freelancers</b></h2> <p>Now that you’re clear on your goals for the new year, look at how you can connect with others on similar paths.</p> <p><strong>Get in touch with other freelancers in your community and see if you can meet for lunch or coffee in early January.</strong> It’s great to get together other freelancers to share your successes and frustrations; I’ve found such meetings to be inspiring and motivating.</p> <p>Another option is to investigate local networking groups, such as those specifically focused on writing or entrepreneurs. Make plans to attend a meeting to see if the group is for you.</p> <h2><b>5. Clean out your inbox</b></h2> <p>Do you still have emails from last January? It’s time to hit delete.</p> <p>If you don’t use an email folder or tagging system already, take time to create one and move files into the appropriate location. A system makes it much easier to find that email from a source when you need to make a last-minute edit. I use Gmail and take full advantage of its tagging and folder system, using different colors for various clients.</p> <h2><b>6. Cull your email subscription list</b></h2> <p>You’ve taken care of the messages in your inbox, but you’ll also need to look at the ones coming in.</p> <p>My inbox quickly fills up with writing and business hints from nearly a dozen websites and professionals. I’ve found that many of them feature the same types of information, and some aren’t even relevant to the type of writing I do. So why am I still on these lists?</p> <p>If you’re in the same boat, the solution is simple: <b>As each newsletter or weekly dispatch comes in, ask yourself if you really need it.</b> Is it helping your business? Are you learning new skills or information? Does it fit with the goals you’ve outlined for your writing?</p> <p>If not, unsubscribe. You’ll end up being more productive, and preventing future inbox clutter.</p> <p>If you’d prefer to stay on email lists but don’t want newsletters or retail offers clogging up your inbox, try using <a title="5 Gmail Hacks That Will Keep Your Head from Exploding" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~alexisgrant.com/2012/07/18/5-gmail-hacks-that-will-keep-your-head-from-exploding/" target="_blank">Gmail filters</a> to make them skip the inbox and go straight to a folder called “Not Important.” You’ll still receive the information, but it’ll be out of sight until you choose to spend time on it.</p> <h2><b>7. Freshen up your website</b></h2> <p>Does your <a title="What is a Landing Page? A Fast Way to Grow Your Blog and Business" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/landing-page/" target="_blank">landing page</a> copy need to be updated to reflect your goals?

These small changes can have a big impact on your business.</p> <p>While you’re at it, think about what you want your website to be: Is it place to display your work and encourage people to hire you? Or do you use it as a home for your blog or passion project?</p> <p>If you don’t have a website, consider launching one. <b>Every writer should have an </b><a title="Without This, You’ll Never Succeed as a Writer" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/without-this-youll-never-succeed-as-a-writer/" target="_blank"><b>online home</b></a><b>, even if it’s just a place to link to a few pieces of work and provide contact information.</b> For inspiration, check out these examples of great <a title="An Online Portfolio Can Change Your Career: 10 Writer Websites We Love" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/writer-websites/" target="_blank">writing websites</a>.</p> <h2><b>8. Update your social media profiles</b></h2> <p>Does your LinkedIn profile accurately reflect your experience and goals? Are you making the most of your short Twitter bio?</p> <p>Use some of your downtime to freshen up your bios and profiles, since they may the first things prospective clients find when they search for you. If you’re not sure what to say, look at other professionals in your niche for ideas.</p> <p>While you’re logged in, check out your Twitter feed. If it’s cluttered with unhelpful information, you might also want to clean out the list of people you follow or start using <a title="The 15 Best Twitter Lists for Writers" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/the-15-best-twitter-lists-for-writers/" target="_blank">Twitter lists</a> to filter important updates.</p> <p>Make the most of the time you have while business is slow. By taking time to relax, get organized and focus on future goals, you’ll be invigorated and ready to tackle the challenges of 2015.</p> <p><b>Does business tend to slow for you over the holidays?

What’s their secret?</p> <p>About a year and a half ago, I became obsessed with <a title="How to Trick Yourself Into Making Major Writing Progress" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/trick-yourself-major-writing-progress/" target="_blank">productivity</a>. What made some people so productive and successful &#8212; especially in creative fields &#8212; and what was the actual science behind it?</p> <p>After reading books on habit, willpower, rituals, routines and anything else that might increase my writing output, I set up what I like to call the <a title="Increase Your Writing Productivity: the productivity pyramid" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.publishingcrawl.com/2014/02/03/increase-your-writing-productivity-the-productivity-pyramid/" target="_blank">Productivity Pyramid</a> (though yes, I realize it’s really a triangle). It’s made up of six crucial elements.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4199" src="http://twlcdn.socialexis.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Productivity_pyramid-300x225.png" alt="Increase productivity as a writer" width="300" height="225" /></p> <h2><b>1. Ritual</b></h2> <p>The top of our Pyramid is the most important. Rituals are habits that begin with a behavioral cue &#8212; a sort of trigger that tells the brain “Now it’s time to work!” Some authors have quite elaborate cues (such as reading the same poem before writing) and others have more simple ones (such as making a cup of tea). Either way, <a title="3 Ways to Train Your Brain to be More Creative" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/train-brain-creative/" target="_blank"><b>having a ritual</b></a><b> helps the brain slip into its creative flow automatically.</b></p> <p>I cultivated my ritual years ago as a student who didn’t want to pay attention in class: writing in a spiral-bound notebook. Just sitting down with the lined paper and a pen tells my brain, “Oh! We’re writing stories now!” and I can use this ritual whenever I need to!</p> <p>Stuck in line at the DMV? No problem &#8212; out comes the notebook. Waiting for my order to finish at the coffee shop? Awesome &#8212; I can pull out my notebook and instantly get to work. Figure out what triggers you to prepare for creative work, and <a title="Increase Your Writing Productivity (part 2): the power of ritual" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~susandennard.com/2014/02/10/increase-your-writing-productivity-part-2-the-power-of-ritual/" target="_blank">create your own ritual</a>.</p> <h2><b>2. Routine</b></h2> <p>Routine is <i>almost</i> as important as ritual because, like ritual, it trains your brain to create on autopilot. This doesn’t mean your creative times are boring or redundant. Rather your brain gets used to drafting at X-hour everyday, and when that hour arrives, your imagination is ready to go!</p> <p>The other powerful component of routine is that it reduces the number of decisions you make in a day. You see, <a title="Conserve Your Willpower: It Runs Out" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.wired.com/2012/10/mf-willpower/" target="_blank">willpower is finite</a>; the more we use, the less we have. Decisions deplete willpower, so <b>if we can reduce the number of decisions we have to make in a day</b> &#8212; if we can <a title="Increase Your Writing Productivity (part 3): the power of routine" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~susandennard.com/2014/02/17/increase-your-writing-productivity-part-3-the-power-of-routine/" target="_blank">routinize</a> certain aspects of our life &#8212; <b>then we can save our decision-making for our writing.</b></p> <h2><b>3. Rhythm</b></h2> <p>Our creative energy shifts and changes throughout the day, just like our circadian rhythms. Figuring out at what point in the day you’re the most productive creatively &#8212; when your brain is really “on” &#8212; can dramatically improve your creative output.</p> <p>My whole life, I’ve thought of myself as an afternoon worker, since that was when I seemed to sit in the chair with my hands on the keyboard. I thought my creative energy was best a few hours after lunch.</p> <p>However, after using a <a title="How Heat-Mapping Your Productivity Can Make You More Productive" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.productiveflourishing.com/how-heat-mapping-your-productivity-can-make-you-more-productive/" target="_blank">productivity heat map</a>, I discovered that I was actually a morning person! I sink into creative flow the deepest and for the longest time immediately after I roll out of bed in the morning. To make the most of my natural rhythm, I’ve set up a routine that starts with me awakening at 5 AM and writing for a few hours straight.</p> <p>Do you know your most productive times of day? Check out your own rhythm with <a title="Increase Your Writing Productivity (part 4): the power of rhythm" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~susandennard.com/2014/03/03/increase-your-writing-productivity-part-4-the-power-of-rhythm/" target="_blank">these strategies</a>.</p> <h2><b>4. Realism</b></h2> <p>This is a pretty straightforward step on the Pyramid, but if you really tap into it, it can be transformative. Why? Because many people set unrealistic goals, get frustrated when they don’t meet them, and then give up. (I am SO guilty of this!)</p> <p><b>One good day of writing doesn’t mean we’ll have that same amazing word count </b><b><i>every </i></b><b>day!</b> However, if you set a truly <a title="The Weird Strategy Dr. Seuss Used to Create His Greatest Work (And Why You Should Use It Too)" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/dr-seuss/" target="_blank">achievable goal</a> &#8212; especially a daily one &#8212; hitting it will help your confidence grow.</p> <p>I set <a title="Write Every Day: How to Meet Your Daily Writing Goals" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/daily-writing-goals/" target="_blank">a daily goal</a> of 1000 words when I’m drafting a new novel. This goal is not only attainable, but it’s <i>easily</i> attainable. It doesn’t intimidate me or set me up for immediate failure. Yet, 1000 words a day leaves me an entire novel in just a few months. What’s your achievable, realistic daily goal?</p> <h2><b>5. Reset</b></h2> <p>It’s unavoidable: Our bodies need regular rest periods. Creatively speaking, our brains can only produce at peak performance for a certain amount of time &#8212; and then we have to reset.</p> <p>Both on a daily scale and on a more long-term weekly or monthly scale, breaks can be your new creative best friend. Have you ever noticed that some of the best <i>aha!</i> moments come when you’re <i>not</i> working?</p> <p>For example, I have my biggest creative breakthroughs while I’m driving on the highway or cooking dinner or walking my dogs &#8212; when I’m not <i>actively</i> thinking about my story, yet the ideas are still knocking around in my subconscious. I know other people who <a title="How Writers Can Use Meditation to Build Focus and Productivity" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/writers-meditation/" target="_blank">use meditation</a> or binge read or take long hikes.</p> <p>Find a reset strategy that works for you, and enjoy your renewed energy and creativity when you return to your work.</p> <h2><b>6. Record</b></h2> <p>Creative endeavors (like novels) can be HUGE. “Write a book” is a daunting undertaking (and <i>such a vague</i> goal), so seeing daily progress can help keep you motivated to continue.</p> <p>To keep myself on track, I <a title="Increase Your Writing Productivity: the power of realism, reset, and record" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~susandennard.com/2014/03/17/increase-your-writing-productivity-the-power-of-realism-reset-and-record/" target="_blank">use a spreadsheet</a> to note how many words I’ve written each day as well as record any other work I’ve done (e.g. revised two scenes or wrote a blog post). Then I tally up the total word count each day so that I can see how much my project is growing!

However, if you´ve been freelance blogging for a while, you might find the course is overall too focused on the beginner level for you.</p> <p><b>What It Will Help You Do:</b> The course will teach you how to write for the web. You’ll learn how to structure a post, how to write compelling articles, how to optimize your writing for SEO and for a specific audience, and how to combat writer’s block and find new ideas for blogging.</p> <p>You’ll also learn how find potential clients, how to pitch your services, and what to do once they’re interested.</p> <p><b>What’s Included</b>: Two sections of the course, Paid to Blog and Successful Blogging, which touch on different aspects of the freelance blogging business.</p> <ul> <li><b>Part 1: Paid to Blog: </b>This section focuses on the “hard” skills and tools you need to succeed as a freelance blogger. Learn how to create your blog from scratch, find clients, pitch your writing, negotiate rates, create a contract, track your time and bill your clients. This section also helps you learn how to use social media to promote your blog and how to build your writing business.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><b>Part 2: Successful Blogging: </b>In this guide, Tom focuses on the “soft” skills, since landing gigs is only half the battle. As a freelance blogger, you also need to be able to write compelling posts, understand your audience, format and structure your blog posts well, and use SEO to your advantage.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><b>Bonuses: </b>If you choose the full package (which I did and heartily recommend), you also get exclusive interviews with writers like Carol Tice from<a title="Make a Living Writing" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.makealivingwriting.com/" target="_blank"> Make a Living Writing</a>, Sophie Lizard from<a title="Be a Freelance Blogger" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~beafreelanceblogger.com/" target="_blank"> Be a Freelance Blogger</a>, and Ali Luke from <a title="Aliventures" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.aliventures.com/" target="_blank">Aliventures</a>.</li> </ul> <p><b>The Best Part</b>: The best part of Tom´s course is that after finishing it, you are ready to get to work. There’s no excuse not to start, since actionable steps are laid out in every lesson.</p> <p>Along with explaining the concepts, Tom also gives you homework and examples of how he accomplished each task. He’s also available to answer questions, so you can email him anytime if you’re not sure how to do something. You can come back to the course at any time to review key concepts.</p> <p><b>What Would Make It Even Better</b>: I can’t think of anything that could be improved. The course addresses every part of the freelance blogging business, and its tips are well explained.</p> <p><b>How It Changed My Life</b>: I started blogging two years ago, not necessarily knowing what I was doing. For a year and a half, I wrote about things I was interested in. I was lucky enough to land a few freelance writing jobs, but I still wasn’t sure where I was headed.</p> <p>Finding Tom’s blog and course was key to my writing career. While going through the course, I learned all the things I was doing wrong and how to improve them.</p> <p>Paid to Blog gave me the confidence to launch my freelance blogging business. I just relaunched my blog on WordPress, and I learned how to write better blog posts for my audience. I’m also more confident in pitching clients and just landed my first paid blogging client.</p> <p><b>Our Recommendation</b>: If you’re new to the world of freelance blogging, this course will help you start your business. Its actionable steps will help you improve as a blogger and find paying clients.</p> <p><i>This post contains affiliate links.

No frustration. Minimal time investment. An amazing manuscript or blog post.</p> <p>Alas, no such magic wand exists. But we do have automatic editing tools, which are the next-best things. Just remember that <b>automatic editing tools are designed to make editing easier, not to eliminate the work completely.</b></p> <h2><b>Putting automatic editing tools to the test</b></h2> <p>During <a title="Self-Editing Basics: 10 Simple Ways to Edit Your Own Book" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/self-editing-basics/" target="_blank">self-edits</a> on my latest manuscript, I experimented with six editing tools, both free and paid, to determine which could be most beneficial to The Write Life’s audience. Besides being an author, I’m an editor, so I also weighed each tool against what I’d look for when editing.</p> <p>Since editing, which is anything that improves your writing, has a broad definition, it’s not surprising that the tools I tried had different functions, from checking grammar and style, to eliminating unnecessary words, to identifying areas for improvement.</p> <p>What you want your editing tool to do will influence which one (or ones) you choose. No one tool can do it all &#8212; nor can one of these tools wave away the work and critical thinking necessary for a well-edited book. <b>An automatic editing tool doesn’t replace a human editor.</b> Because language rules and elements of a good story can be so flexible, human eyes will always be superior to the rigidity of automatic tools.</p> <p>Here are those six tools broken into three categories, based on function.</p> <p><i>[Editor’s note: Some companies offered free access to the paid versions of their tools for the purposes of this test, but all opinions are the writer’s.]</i></p> <h2><b>Check your grammar and style</b></h2> <p>Sometimes, you just want to make sure you&#8217;re not making any silly spelling or grammar mistakes.</p> <h3><b>1. </b><b><a title="Grammarly" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7319408-11578192" target="_blank">Grammarly</a></b></h3> <p><b>What It Does: </b>Grammarly is a grammar checker and proofreader.</p> <p><b>Price:</b> $29.95 per month, $59.95 per quarter or $139.95 per year</p> <p><b>Who It’s For:</b> Anyone, though most useful for corporate business people and academics.</p> <p><b>How It Works:</b> Copy and paste the text into the online dashboard and let Grammarly work its magic. It flags potential errors, gives suggestions and provides an explanation if you need it.</p> <p><b>The Best Part:</b> Grammarly is easy to use and pointed out a vocabulary issue or two that none of the other tools did. It’s superior to Microsoft Word’s grammar checker.</p> <p><b>What Would Make It Better:</b> As an editor, I’ve found that many people don’t understand or care to learn the technical explanation for why something’s wrong. Plain language (or as plain as you can get) explanations for mistakes would make it accessible to more writers.</p> <p><b>Our Recommendation:</b> Grammarly is best for the final <a title="Self-Publishing? These Editing Tips Will Ensure You Release a Quality Book" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/self-publishing-editing-tips/" target="_blank">proofreading</a> stage, or for people who want to learn more about the technical aspects grammar. If you’re an editor or strong writer, you might find yourself ignoring more flagged items than you fix.</p> <h3><b>2. </b><b><a title="After the Deadline" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.afterthedeadline.com/" target="_blank">After the Deadline</a></b></h3> <p><b>What It Does: </b>Like Grammarly, After the Deadline is a grammar checker.</p> <p><b>Price:</b> Free for personal use</p> <p><b>Who It’s For:</b> Anyone</p> <p><b>How It Works:</b> Click “Demonstration,” paste the text you want to check, and click “Check Writing.” After the Deadline underlines any potential issues and explains its reasoning.</p> <p><b>The Best Part:</b> It’s free! You can also use it on your self-hosted WordPress site, as an extension or add-on for Chrome or Firefox, or with OpenOffice.org.</p> <p><b>What Would Make It Better:</b> A definition of passive voice that explains how you construct it grammatically. After the Deadline rightly explains what passive voice does, but it seems to focus only on the “be” verb, which occasionally leads to falsely labeling non-passive constructions as passive.</p> <p><b>Our Recommendation:</b> You get what you pay for with After the Deadline. Use it for a final proofread, but exercise good judgment and don’t make every change it suggests &#8212; it’s not as sophisticated as Grammarly.</p> <h2><b>Improve your writing</b></h2> <p>If you&#8217;re looking for a critique that goes a bit deeper, try one of these options.</p> <h3><b>3. </b><b><a title="AutoCrit" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://oa127.infusionsoft.com/go/autocrit/thewritelife" target="_blank">AutoCrit</a></b></h3> <p><b>What It Does: </b>AutoCrit analyzes your manuscript to identify areas for improvement, including pacing and momentum, dialogue, strong writing, word choice and repetition.</p> <p><b>Price:</b> $5 per month, $8 per month or $12 per month. Your membership level determines how many words you can analyze at once, from 1,000 words to unlimited.</p> <p><b>Who It’s For</b>: Fiction writers</p> <p><b>How It Works: </b>Paste your text into the online dashboard or upload a document and click on AutoCrit’s tabs to see their analysis.</p> <p><b>The Best Part:</b> I spent the most time in “Compare to Fiction” tab, which is a comprehensive look at common issues. It highlighted my tendency to start sentences with “and” and “but,” and identified my most repeated words. I felt like I learned something about my writing, and that’s something I don’t think I could say about the other tools.</p> <p><b>What Would Make It Better:</b> A more accurate definition of passive voice. It highlights any use of the “be” and “had” verbs, neither of which fully capture <a title="Passive Voice" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/passive-voice" target="_blank">passive voice</a> (you need a past participle in addition to a “be” verb), and many active voice constructions were falsely labeled as passive.</p> <p><b>Our Recommendation:</b> AutoCrit is great to guide your edits in the <a title="Use Hemingway’s Advice to Rewrite Like a Pro" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/use-hemingways-advice-to-rewrite-like-a-pro/" target="_blank">self-editing</a> stage. It’s best used for developmental edits, rewrites and avoiding common writing no-nos.</p> <h3><b>4. </b><b><a title="ProWritingAid" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~prowritingaid.com?afid=1714" target="_blank">ProWritingAid</a></b></h3> <p><b>What It Does: </b>ProWritingAid analyzes your writing and produces reports on areas such as overused words, writing style, sentence length, grammar and repeat words and phrases.</p> <p><b>Price:</b> Free, with a premium membership that gives you access to more options such as using ProWritingAid in Microsoft Word and Google Docs, the ability to edit text within the text editor, and access to more reports.</p> <p><b>Who It’s For:</b> Anyone</p> <p><b>How It Works:</b> Click on “Editing Tool,” paste your text, then click “Analyze.” Only members can paste over 1,000 words at a time, but membership is free with an email address or social media account. Use the sidebar on the left to view potential edits to make.</p> <p><b>The Best Part:</b> ProWritingAid delivers similar results to AutoCrit, and though ProWritingAid has a premium option, most of the areas you’ll want checked are available for free.</p> <p><b>What Would Make It Better:</b> Though ProWritingAid checks grammar, I slipped in a your/you’re mistake without getting flagged. I wasn’t overly fond of the website design, especially with its big ads, but it’s functional and ads are the price you pay for a free tool.</p> <p><b>Our Recommendation:</b> Use ProWritingAid in the self-editing stage to guide your edits. It may not be as comprehensive as AutoCrit, but for a free tool, it’s a decent contender.</p> <h3><b>5. </b><b><a title="Hemingway App" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.hemingwayapp.com/" target="_blank">Hemingway App</a></b></h3> <p><b>What It Does:</b> Hemingway App provides a readability score &#8212; the lowest grade level someone would need to understand the text &#8212; and analyzes your writing to identify areas for improvement.</p> <p><b>Price:</b> Free online, $6.99 for desktop version</p> <p><b>Who It’s For:</b> Anyone</p> <p><b>How It Works:</b> Paste your text into the dashboard and scan for highlighted sections of text. The highlighted text is color coded depending on your area of improvement: hard to read sentences, presence of adverbs, simpler phrases or passive voice use.</p> <p><b>The Best Part:</b> In addition to providing examples on how to fix passive voice or complex phrases, Hemingway App also identifies how many -ly adverbs and passive voice constructions you have and suggests a maximum number to use based on your word count.</p> <p>In my prologue, for example, I had one use of passive voice, and Hemingway App suggested aiming for six uses or fewer &#8212; which I nailed. These recommendations reinforce the idea that not all adverbs or passive voice constructions are bad, and that’s something other tools miss.</p> <p><b>What Would Make It Better:</b> Hemingway App was the cleanest and easiest to use of the free editing tools, but it’s not a grammar checker or proofreader. Even though it’s not meant to catch grammar and spelling mistakes, any editing application that catches those mistakes is instantly more attractive.</p> <p><b>Our Recommendation:</b> Use Hemingway App to increase the readability of your writing and identify problem sentences during the <a title="25 Editing Tips for Tightening Your Copy: Now a Printable Checklist" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/25-editing-tips-checklist-form/" target="_blank">copyediting</a> stage, but supplement your efforts with a grammar and spell checker.</p> <h2><b>Eliminate word fluff</b></h2> <p>Those unnecessary words and phrases are getting in your story&#8217;s way.</p> <h3><b>6. </b><b><a title="WordRake" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.wordrake.com/" target="_blank">WordRake</a></b></h3> <p><b>What It Does: </b>WordRake cuts out the unnecessary words or phrases that creep into your writing. It works with Microsoft Word and Outlook, depending on which license you purchase. I tested the Microsoft Word version.</p> <p><b>Price:</b> $129 for one year, $229 for two or $259 for three years (Microsoft Word-only version)</p> <p><b>Who It’s For:</b> Bloggers, authors and editors using Microsoft Word</p> <p><b>How It Works:</b> WordRake is an add-in for Microsoft Word and requires you to install the program before using it, though it’s as easy as following the instructions. In Word, select the text you want to edit, then use the WordRake add-in. It uses track changes to suggest edits, which you can accept or reject.</p> <p><b>The Best Part:</b> WordRake is as close as you can get to an automatic editor. It appealed to me more as an editor than writer, but it’s great at eliminating unnecessary phrases and words &#8212; and it’s those words that bog down your writing.</p> <p><b>What Would Make It Better:</b> I threw a your/you’re mistake in to see if WordRake would catch it. It didn’t, even though Microsoft Word flagged it. If WordRake could catch common writing mistakes like your/you’re, their/they’re/there in addition to unnecessary words, it’d be a hard tool to beat.</p> <p><b>Our Recommendation: </b>WordRake is a great tool for the copyediting stage.

You want to call your own shots, set your own hours and work from your own space.</p> <p>You have weighed the pros and cons, <a title="4 Steps to Prepare for the Instability of the Freelance Life" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/prepare-for-the-instability-of-freelance-life/" target="_blank">made a plan</a> and are ready to turn your side hustle into your full-time job. You have a couple of regular clients on board, with a few more waiting in the wings. You’ve cleaned out that weird little nook in the corner of your house and put in a nice desk and some office trappings so you don’t have to write with your laptop on your knees.</p> <p>You’ve given notice to your employer, EasyPub, updated your website and given yourself a pump-up talk. You’re ready to dive into life as a <a title="How to Handle Being a Full-Time Freelancer (Without Going Nuts)" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/how-to-handle-being-a-full-time-freelancer-without-going-nuts/" target="_blank">full-time freelancer</a>!</p> <p>Before you do, make sure you’ve planned ahead to get your legal ducks in a row &#8212; you don’t want the contract you signed with your employer to come back to bite you.</p> <p><b>If you know your obligations, you’ll be able to prepare to launch your freelance business while staying on the right side of the law.</b> Here are the things you need to consider before you leave your day job.</p> <h2><b>1. Your contractual obligations to your existing employer</b></h2> <p>If you signed a contract at any time while you were working for the company, you need to check to see if you agreed to these specific provisions. Some companies put these provisions in their employees handbooks, so you’ll need to look at that, too.</p> <h3>Non-compete clause</h3> <p>A non-compete agreement prevents you from working in competition with your employer and must be limited in time (generally not more than two years) and geographic scope. Non-competes are enforceable in <a title="Employee Noncompetes A State by State Survey" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.beckreedriden.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Noncompetes-50-State-Survey-Chart-20130814.pdf" target="_blank">most, but not all states</a>.</p> <p><strong>If you have signed a non-compete, you must read it carefully to determine what you can and cannot do to make a living after you leave the company.</strong> For example, a non-compete might say that if you’re a copywriter for a marketing company in Chicago, you can’t work for any competitive company within a 25-mile radius for two years.</p> <h3>Non-solicitation of customers agreement</h3> <p>A <a title="Understanding Nonsolicitation Agreements" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/understanding-nonsolicitation-agreements.html" target="_blank">non-solicitation of customers agreement</a> is designed to prevent former employees from poaching the company’s customers for a limited period of time, usually a year. This is different from a non-compete and is becoming more common.</p> <p>If your job involved close interaction with customers, they have a relationship with you. The company doesn’t want to lose the customers when they lose you as an employee.</p> <p>As with the non-compete provision, non-solicitation provisions are enforceable in most states, but not all. You will not be able to work with the company’s customers after you leave your job if you signed an agreement with a non-solicitation provision in it. This provision could impact your projected income, if you were planning on continuing to write copy for Acme Corp. as a freelancer.</p> <h3><b>Non-solicitation of employees clause</b></h3> <p>If you’re leaving your job to start your own company and are planning to hire your own employees, you need to be aware of this provision. Many companies want to protect their workers from being taken by departing employees for a certain period of time, usually a year.</p> <p>Again, the company is trying to protect its relationships with contract language and the contract, if reasonable, is enforceable in most states.</p> <h2><b>2. Your fiduciary obligations to your existing employer</b></h2> <p>A fiduciary obligation is the duty to act in another person’s best interest and not in your own. It means you have to put that other person first &#8212; and in this case it’s your employer. When you’re making plans to leave your job, keep these two points in mind.</p> <h3><b>Best efforts</b></h3> <p>While you are still with EasyPub, you have the obligation to use your best efforts at your job &#8212; even while you’re planning to leave it. Don’t get distracted by the excitement of going out on your own and forget to give your all to your current employer before you leave.</p> <h3><b>Duty of loyalty</b></h3> <p>If you’re a high-level or skilled employee with the company, you owe a duty of loyalty while still employed. <b>When you’re planning to leave your job, you may not take any action that competes with the company</b> (like convincing a prospective customer to hold an assignment until you’re on your own), <b>even if you haven’t signed a non-compete agreement.</b></p> <p>You always want to leave a job on good terms. Building and keeping good relationships with former employers will be useful as you develop your career and perhaps build your own company.</p> <hr /><p><em>Leaving your job? Don't take any action that competes with the company, says @KathrynGoldman</em><br><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Leaving+your+job%3F+Don%27t+take+any+action+that+competes+with+the+company%2C+says+%40KathrynGoldman&via=thewritelife&related=thewritelife&url=http://thewritelife.com/quit-job-to-freelance-legal/' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'>Click To Tweet</a><br><hr /> <h2><b>3. Ownership of intellectual property and confidential information</b></h2> <p>While working for EasyPub, you had access to the company’s information. Some of the information had to do with customers, some of it related to EasyPub’s business and some of it you created yourself.</p> <p>You have obligations to protect EasyPub’s confidential information and to respect its intellectual property even after you leave the company.</p> <h3><b>Intellectual property</b></h3> <p>Work you created while you were employed by EasyPub belongs to the company unless you have a written agreement that says otherwise.</p> <p>When you are <a title="How Your Miserable Day Job Can Help Launch Your Freelance Career" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/launch-your-freelance-career/" target="_blank">making your plans</a> to leave EasyPub, you should not create any work on the company’s time, or using the company’s equipment, materials or other resources.</p> <p>To be sure that what you create during this planning stage is yours and not the company’s, you should not use your company-issued laptop or other tools for your side hustle. Don’t use your company email address to do business for your new gig. Keep everything completely separate to protect yourself and your new business.</p> <h3><b>Confidential information</b></h3> <p>Most companies have provisions in their handbooks that require employees to return all company property, including all information in the employee’s possession, to prevent any disclosure of that information.</p> <p>To comply, search your computer, email (including sent and deleted email), any cloud storage services, phone, iPad, and anywhere and everywhere else you might have stored files or data owned by the company.</p> <p>Leaving a day job to go out on your own is an exciting time. Reduce the risk and calm your nerves by being thoughtful about how you do it.</p> <p><i>Kathryn is a lawyer, but she’s not </i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>your</i></span><i> lawyer, so this article isn’t technically legal advice.

Leave a comment by December 15, 2014, to enter! (UPDATE: Jessica won!)</i></p> <p>If you’re like me, you spent most of your childhood in school. That’s where you learned how to learn, and you’ve probably come to associate improvement with school. So, when it comes to improving your writing, it’s natural that you would consider a Master of Arts (MA) or a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree. After all, what better better way to give yourself time to write and a structured place to do it?</p> <p>But MFAs are time consuming and expensive, and it’s certainly possible to significantly improve as a writer without them. <b>How do you know if an MFA is right for you?</b> And can you reproduce the benefits of an MFA without enrolling in a program?</p> <h2><b>My take on the MFA debate</b></h2> <p>Full disclosure: I have both a BA and an MA in writing. It’s hard for me to regret those years; they were a lot of fun and I gained an enormous amount of experience. I also met my husband, so I can’t say my MA was useless. However, I think I could have taken another path, perhaps one that didn’t require so much of my time, money and inner calm.</p> <p>Based on my experience, I don’t think having an MA or MFA is necessary to become a great writer. This should be obvious to anyone who knows anything about literary history: Many famous and influential writers did not begin in academia.</p> <p><b>Instead, to become a better writer without a set path, replicate important aspects of the MFA.</b> Basically, the money you spend for your MFA (and it’s a lot of money) insists upon discipline and buys a few elements crucial to the writing process. Recreate these elements on your own to strengthen your writing skills without enrolling in an MFA.</p> <h2><b>1. Read across genres</b></h2> <p>Great writers need to read; there’s no way around this one. Language has to start in your brain to end up on the page, and the best way to get it there is to read. (Or listen to audiobooks on tape, whatever works for you).</p> <p>Expose yourself to past developments in your genre, as well as what’s happening now. This is where you acquire the tools you’ll use, as well as improve on, later.</p> <p>While reading may seem like a simple task, it’s not. With hundreds of millions of <a title="Google: There Are 129,864,880 Books in the Entire World" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~mashable.com/2010/08/05/number-of-books-in-the-world/" target="_blank">books in the world</a>, it can be impossible to know where to start. <b>An MFA program will not only give you an organized, vetted list of these books, but it will also force you to read them and analyze them thoughtfully.</b> The program will expose you to new styles and authors you may never have come across otherwise, expanding your toolset and allowing you to contextualize your own work.</p> <p>You can discover new works and authors without an MFA, of course, and you should continue to do it after one. <b>Read everything &#8212; not only in your genre, but in completely new ones.</b> Step outside your comfort zone. Read extensively and often. Listen to books on your way to work, and always have something new to read.</p> <hr /><p><em>Read everything -- not only in your genre, but in completely new ones, says @inkhat</em><br><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Read+everything+--+not+only+in+your+genre%2C+but+in+completely+new+ones%2C+says+%40inkhat&via=thewritelife&related=thewritelife&url=http://thewritelife.com/do-you-need-an-mfa/' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'>Click To Tweet</a><br><hr /> <p>Don’t know where to start? Published authors often give examples of their favorite works in interviews. Look up one or two of your favorite writers, and try a few of their recommendations.</p> <h2><b>2. Meet word count requirements</b></h2> <p>Writing is craft, and craft requires time and effort. Carving out this time can be difficult. Unless you’re the incarnation of discipline, you’re going to have trouble hitting your <a title="Write Every Day: How to Meet Your Daily Writing Goals" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/daily-writing-goals/" target="_blank">word count goal</a> every day.</p> <p>An MFA program will insist on that word count. It requires you to produce, and to produce at a fast pace, something that is necessary to learn your craft.</p> <p>This pace also helps you develop the ability to stop thinking of every sentence as precious, let go of your inner editor and move on &#8212; which can be harder than it seems. The less you’ve written, the more valuable each word becomes, and the more difficult it is to edit them. As you keep writing, you’ll realize that your ideas, no matter how poetic, aren’t perfect. Editing and writing become easier the more you do the work of hitting that word count goal.</p> <p>Of course, you can achieve daily writing goals without an MFA, but the process involves a great deal of discipline and focus. You have to push yourself to meet daily, weekly or monthly word counts. It’s hard to do this alone, which is where the final element comes into play.</p> <h2><b>3. Find a group of supportive, committed people</b></h2> <p>You need to foster a group of peers with whom you can discuss and trade writing. These should be people whose writing and opinions you respect, and who aren’t afraid to offer constructive criticism. If you find yourself in a group that only praises your writing, leave. It’s not going to help you at all.</p> <p>An MFA will give you this group gift-wrapped and ready to go. You start with a <a title="9 Keys to Creating an Effective Writing Accountability Group" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/writing-accountability-group/" target="_blank">critique group</a> on day one, writers vetted and approved by the same people who selected you. It’s likely that these relationships, both as friends and colleagues, will continue long after you’ve left the program.</p> <p>Again, a writing critique group is something you can create on your own, but it can be challenging. Writing is a solitary art, and many writers tend to be independent by nature. <a title="Want to Join a Writing Group? 8 Places to Look" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/join-writing-group/" target="_blank">Finding a group</a> means fostering professional relationships, and that can take time and effort.</p> <p>Look online for local groups, or attend local <a title="29 Fantastic Writing Conferences for Authors, Bloggers and Freelancers" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/28-fantastic-writers-conferences-authors-bloggers-freelancers/" target="_blank">conventions and conferences</a> in your genre. Go to signings and readings. Chances are you’ll find intelligent, like-minded people who can help you learn to write, and vice versa.</p> <h2><b>Do you need an MFA?</b></h2> <p>If you’re having trouble with these elements, or the discipline of writing itself, an MFA might be the right choice for you.</p> <p>Enrolling in a program also buys you dedicated time to write, which is often difficult to find when you’re working a <a title="How to Stay Sane While Building Your Writing Career Part Time" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/stay-sane-building-writing-career-part-time/" target="_blank">full-time job</a>. It’s also a socially acceptable time to write, which translates fairly seamlessly into a resume when you leave. It may not land you a job, but it’s an easy story to explain. A program also exposes you to research tools and professional pathways you might not otherwise be able to access.</p> <p>On the other hand, pursuing an MFA is a serious undertaking that requires a great deal of time and money.

Those feelings aren’t reserved for the movies.</p> <p>But how much study have you put into <i>how</i> your favorite horror authors have gone about scaring you with the written word?</p> <p>Movies rely on editing, music cues, performance, special visual and makeup effects . . . a whole parade of <a title="Writing a Novel? 6 Visual Storytelling Techniques to Borrow From Film and TV" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/writing-novel-6-visual-storytelling-techniques-borrow-film-tv/" target="_blank">cinematic tools</a>. But in prose all we have to work with are words, and our readers’ imaginations. The good news is that those are powerful tools.</p> <p>Though you may not have much control over any individual reader’s imagination, or his interpretation of your work, the ways you arrange words into sentences and sentences into paragraphs can activate your readers’ psyches in ways you may not have thought possible.</p> <h2><b>It all comes down to breathing</b></h2> <p>Even when reading silently, we tend to breathe along with what we’re reading as if we were reading it aloud. It’s impossible for us to turn certain parts of our brain off and when something causes us to start <a title="FREAKY: Your Breathing Patterns Change When You Read Email" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.businessinsider.com/email-apnea-how-email-change-breathing-2012-12" target="_blank">breathing differently</a>, that forces us into different states. When you’re in a blind panic you tend to hyperventilate, breathing in quick, shallow gasps. When you’re nervous or anxious about something (the feeling of suspense), you tend to hold your breath, and breathe more slowly.</p> <p>The good news for horror and thriller authors is that these processes also work <i>in reverse</i>. <b>If you can force that breathing state</b> (or, more accurately, some smaller, less physically traumatic version of that state) <b>in your readers, you’ll bring on the requisite psychological response.</b></p> <h2><b>Evoking suspense and anxiety</b></h2> <p>When you’re building suspense, evoking a feeling of impending doom or the terrifying fear of the unknown, get your reader to hold her breath. Stop her from taking her next breath for longer than normal. And though it may seem impossible to do this with words on a page, remember what I said about how we unconsciously breathe as though we’re reading aloud even when we aren’t.</p> <p>One of the reasons that sentences are finite is that the period at the end allows us a breath. Paragraphs give us a chance to take a deeper breath. So if you want your reader to slow her breathing and start feeling nervous, anxious or fearful, keep your sentences long, and your paragraphs even longer.</p> <p>Very near the beginning of Shirley Jackson’s classic <a title="The Haunting of Hill House" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143039989/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0143039989&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=ABIDEC3TV3SFGLPV" target="_blank"><i>The Haunting of Hill House</i></a>, the protagonist, Eleanor, is on her way to meet her fellow paranormal investigators at a house that’s known to be haunted. Though excited about being a part of something potentially important, and getting away from her dreary life in the city, Eleanor is terrified of what she’ll find there, not just from ghosts but as a result of what we’d now refer to as social anxiety. The closer she gets to the house, the more anxious she is.</p> <p>Jackson conveys this anxiety with a single paragraph wherein Eleanor makes a stop in a small town along the way and has a cup of coffee. It’s an innocuous scene, but told in a tight <a title="Point of View: How Writers Can Master This Crucial Story Element" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/point-of-view/" target="_blank">POV</a>, it’s incredibly nerve-wracking. This single paragraph consists of ten sentences. The first of those sentences is the shortest at 28 words. The last is the longest at 52 words.</p> <p>Think about the last time you read, much less wrote, a sentence that’s 52 words long.</p> <p><b>By the end of that monster paragraph, Shirley Jackson left her readers gasping for air</b>, and helped solidify <i>The Haunting of Hill House </i>as one of the undisputed classics of the genre.</p> <h2><b>Eliciting horror and panic</b></h2> <p>On the flip side, eventually the monster, serial killer or villain finally reveals himself and the terror (a generalized, creepy dread) turns to horror (the visceral reaction to a traumatic event in progress).</p> <p>Now you want to do just the opposite: <b>Force your readers to breathe </b><b><i>too often</i></b><b>.</b> Get them hyperventilating. Do this with short sentences. Even shorter paragraphs.</p> <p>One-sentence paragraphs.</p> <p>In another classic haunted house tale, <a title="Hell House" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312868855/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0312868855&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=P2KIFBWUFOBAS4KH" target="_blank"><i>Hell House</i></a>, author Richard Matheson evokes this feeling of panic in one scene of nine paragraphs, each with no more than two short sentences. Readers have been trained to take a full breath after each paragraph, so breaths are coming fast and furious through:</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>She stopped with a gasp and looked at the Spanish table.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>The telephone was ringing.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>It can’t, she thought. It hasn’t worked in more than thirty years.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>She wouldn’t answer it. She knew who it was.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>It kept on ringing, the shrill sounds stabbing at her eardrums, at her brain.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>She mustn’t answer it. She wouldn’t.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>The telephone kept ringing.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>“No,” she said.</i></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>Ringing. Ringing. Ringing. Ringing.</i></p> <p>I know &#8212; technically, that last paragraph has four sentences, but let’s consider that staccato stacking of “Ringing”s as one sentence with partial breaths between each word.</p> <p>Instead of a single ten-sentence-long paragraph, we have paragraphs of one or two sentences, with the longest sentence/paragraph clocking in at 14 words, or precisely half the length of Shirley Jackson’s <i>shortest</i> sentence.</p> <p>Following this scene, there are a couple of slightly longer paragraphs as the protagonist tries to take charge of the situation, but this is quickly dismissed by more staccato attacks on the senses. And, like <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i>, the ongoing success of <i>Hell House</i> is proof of its effectiveness.</p> <h2><b>Putting this technique into practice</b></h2> <p>This idea of controlling your readers’ breathing is not the be-all-end-all of “<a title="Writing Scary: How to Use Pacing, Sentence Structure, and Word Choice to Scare the Pants Off Your Readers" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~tutorials.writersdigest.com/p-507-writing-scary-how-to-use-pacing-sentence-structure-and-word-choice-to-scare-the-pants-off-your-readers.aspx" target="_blank">writing scary</a>,” but with some practice it will work for you.</p> <p>And being aware of when to best use this strategy will also prevent you from overusing it, and move the majority of your prose somewhere into the readable, accessible, and comfortable center &#8212; until you want things to start getting scary again.</p> <p><strong><b>Do you “write scary”?
