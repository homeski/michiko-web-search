<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://geni.us/1xyc" target="_blank">99c on Kindle</a> until Dec 31st</h2>
<p><a href="http://tahlianewland.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6881 alignleft" src="http://tahlianewland.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB-198x300.jpg" alt="Worlds_Final-WEB" width="198" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><em>‘The barrier between the worlds shatters like the window. The beast is loose. My nightmare has become real. The guy has totally lost it. If he finds us here, we could die. No, I don’t doubt it; we will die.’</em></p>
<p>Author and editor Prunella Smith inhabits a multilayered reality. Physically, she lives in the Australian bush with her crazy cat Merlin. In her work world, she edits the love story of Kelee, a Magan Lord’s daughter, and in the cyber-world of social media, she’s subjected to slanderous attacks by a disgruntled author. To complicate matters further she sees things through the eyes of a Tibetan Yogi, has strange dreams and relives old memories.</p>
<p>Separate worlds, interconnected and complementary, but can they help when Prunella becomes victim to a real life stalker and her sanity is threatened?</p>
<p><em>Worlds Within Worlds</em> has a unique perspective on the nature of creativity. Its touch is light, its humour distinctive but it reaches deep into the nature of human experience.</p>
<p><em>“This is riveting stuff, part magical realism dreamscape, part taut psychological thriller, and I was literally on the edge of my seat when the final twist—and what a twist it is—came around. Phew, what a ride! I can honestly say it is the best book I have read this year.” Frank Kusy, author of Rupee Millionaires.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;This book will make you think. Considering the deluge of new works streaming from authors these days, that may be the highest praise a novel can receive.” Amy Spahn, editor.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Writers will appreciate Worlds Within Worlds for its exploration of the creative process. Intelligent readers will enjoy the memorable characters, the suspense, and the intricacies of Ella&#8217;s interlocking worlds.&#8221;  Amazon Vine Reviewer.</em></p>

<p>Awesome Allshorts showcases talented authors from around the globe, many whose novels have received multiple honors, including Awesome Indies approved status.</p>
<p><em>“An eclectic mix of short stories, from the mundane to the downright weird, these stories make the mundanity of day-to-day activities entrancing, or tell tales of other times and places. There&#8217;s something here for everyone. The stories are not only well selected, they are also well ordered. I think that&#8217;s a very important feature in a short story anthology. I thoroughly recommend this collection.” Illiterarty Reviews.</em></p>
<p><em>“I did not expect these stories to move me as deeply as they did. Short works often struggle to pack a significant punch in their diminished wordcount, but the pieces contained in this collection rise to the occasion. Some had me on the edge of my seat in suspense. Some brought tears to my eyes with their emotional depth. And some utilized unique writing styles so artfully that they should be studied in literature classes.” AI Reviews.</em></p>

<p>The Ghosts of Eden by Andrew J. H. Sharp is, like the story of Joseph’s coat from the Hebrew Bible, of many colors. It is a story that zooms back and forth in time and across strains of characters’ lives, at times with the speed of a supersonic jet, and at others, languidly like an eagle gliding on wind currents.<br />
On the one hand, it is the story of Michael Lacy, the son of English settlers in pre-independence Uganda, who at the opening of the story is a prominent surgeon in the UK. On the other, the story of the Katura brothers, Stanley and Zachye, two members of the Bahima tribe who are sent off to school to learn the ways of the Bazungu, or whites, in order to be able to survive in the Uganda that is to come.<br />
Although fictional, The Ghosts of Eden gives the reader an in depth look at African culture and the strains between traditional tribal culture, and the ‘modern’ culture imposed by colonization. The characters are so well formed, we feel as if we know them – their dreams and desires as familiar as our own. Told from a semi-omniscient point of view, the author nonetheless allows us to glimpse inside key characters’ minds, adding significantly to the tension that builds steadily from the moment Michael’s seat mate on the plane as he’s returning to Uganda to speak at a medical conference, dies quietly in his sleep. There is action and mystery aplenty in Sharp’s narrative, but this is also a love story – one with more twists and turns than an English garden maze as Michael, Stanley, and Zachye all vie for the heart of the beautiful, but enigmatic Felice.<br />
My only complaint about the book was the author’s habit of not indenting certain paragraphs within chapters, until I realized that this was signaling a change in the action. That realization came about a third into the second chapter, so this really doesn’t count as a distraction.<br />
The Ghosts of Eden defies genre characterization. Mystery, thriller, romance, historical novel, or perhaps a better description is literary tour de force. An exceptionally well-written novel that, once begun, is hard to put down until you arrive almost breathlessly at the end – and as you close it, you say, that’s the way it should be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/a-letter-to-amazon-from-the-awesome-indies/"><img width="890" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/070119j0267-890x400.jpg" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="Pencil on notebooks" /></a><div>This is a copy of the email our coordinator Tahlia Newland sent to Amazon via the KDP support team. Whether it gets to anyone who is interested or is moved to do something is yet to be seen, but the attempt has been made to make contact.</div>
<p>Hi KDP support team</p>
<div>Could you please pass this on to whoever is concerned about the plethora of poor quality books Amazon is offering its Kindle readers.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;m the coordinator of <a href="http://awesomindies.net/" target="_blank">Awesome Indies Books</a>, our purpose is to identify and promote self-published and indie published books that meet the same or higher standards as mainstream published books.  I&#8217;m pretty sure that someone in the Amazon organisation must be concerned about the lack of quality of a large number of the self-published books you offer your customers. I&#8217;ve heard Nook owners say, &#8220;Yes, Kindle offers more books, but most of them are crap.&#8221;  I figure that&#8217;s not so great for business in the long term.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t want to institute any kind of quality control from your end. It is unnecessary and would be detrimental to do so. The answer, I think, lies not in preventing the publication of poor quality books, but in making the quality books more visible, so they are the ones readers are more likely to find and read.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Any system working on such an idea immediately raises the question of what constitutes quality and who is qualified to evaluate. Amazon star ratings are well known to be unreliable. Much as we would like to be able to work from customer reviews, we can&#8217;t. Even if we put aside the sock puppet accounts and 5 star review purchasing, most reader/reviewers don&#8217;t leave a review unless they have something good to say, so a lack of low starred reviews does not mean that a book is as good as its rating suggests. So where can you turn to get an idea of the quality of a book? Book awards should be a reliable source for quality books, but awards that are voted on by readers merely indicate which authors have the biggest social media network that he or she can mobilize to go and vote.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/about/approved-reviewers/" target="_blank">The Awesome Indies reviewers</a> &#8211; those who assess books for approval &#8211; are editors, university lecturers, journalists, award-winning authors and others with degrees in English literature, creative writing or journalism. Such people are most able to evaluate quality in writing, and are those whose opinions are most likely to be respected. We also have a <a href="http://awesomeindies.net/about/the-criteria/" target="_blank">clear and relevant criteria</a> against which to evaluate.</div>
<div>BRAG is another organisation who highlights quality independent books, but their criteria is very loose. The indiePendents is another organisation trying to do something similar, but their criteria only relates to copy editing, not the other forms of editing that are so vital for fiction. Even so, any initiatives you undertake to draw readers attention to quality indie books could include books that they have approved as well, depending on how high you want to draw the line for quality.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So the Awesome Indies have solved the &#8216;who decides what&#8217;s good&#8217; issue. We can tell you which are the well crafted books (take a look at <a href="http://awesomeindies.net/about/the-criteria/" target="_blank">our criteria for approval</a>), all you have to do is work out &#8211; assuming that you do want to direct your customers to the best of indie publishing &#8211; how you can get these books in front of your readers in such a way that they will be more likely to buy them than their less polished counterparts.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;ll leave the &#8216;how&#8217; up to you. The point is that we have a well-thought out and reliable system for identifying well-crafted books, and I think it would benefit Amazon to make some kind of commitment to support quality in indie publishing. Give your readers a reliable way to sort the wheat from the chaff and they will be very happy. It would also be very good for public perception of your company.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I hope that you can see that a system that makes quality books more visible would be good for the customer, good for you and good for the indie publishing business as a whole. Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if the authors who work hard to write well, and who pay thousands of dollars for editing and cover designs had more of a chance to get a return for their investment than those who didn&#8217;t make the same kind of investment? Higher visibility for quality products is the only way to do that. And you can provide it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let me know if you&#8217;re interested in talking further about this.</div>
<div></div>

<p>“Night Watch” draws the reader into the action from the start, bonding them to the storyline with cliffhanger chapter endings, and keeping them on tenterhooks till the very end. The author uses her specialist knowledge of sailing to good effect, adding a sense of excitement, but is never at risk of alienating less well-informed readers.</p>
<p>The central character, Em Ridge, in her thirties, is recently widowed after a tragic boating accident. A newly qualified captain, she sets off from Canada to the Caribbean, in charge of her first commercial delivery of a luxury sailing ship. Not long after they depart, a crew member disappears – an incident that threatens to scupper Em&#8217;s career and reputation. Soon a bizarre connection emerges between this death and Em&#8217;s late husband’s, and the mystery becomes ever more complex, with Em&#8217;s life increasingly endangered.</p>
<p>Key themes include the nature of friendships and families &#8211; how well we really know each other and the difference between friends and families. Estranged from her own family, Em has formed close friendships with her neighbours who support her at times of crisis. The class distinctions and the ethics of the sailing community are explored, as is the meaning of true wealth. Also under consideration are the social mores of those who, like Em, choose to tread their own unconventional path.</p>
<p>The characters are engaging and well drawn. I especially enjoyed the portrayal of Em&#8217;s neighbours and of Ben, the new police officer who has moved to the area after a personal tragedy. Their relationships, dialogue and actions were believable and consistent, and I was rooting for Em right from the start.</p>
<p>The plot flowed well, but a number of minor typos drew me up occasionally—however, the author assures me that these have since been attended to. The style was natural and easy, and the only writing tic that I spotted was the habit of using &#8220;um&#8221; or &#8220;uh&#8221; or &#8220;ah&#8221; to make a speech sound hesitant. This made them sound phony; the speeches would have been just as effective without.</p>
<p>This was a gripping and satisfying read that would appeal to readers who are interested in leisure sailing, those who like cosy mysteries, and those keen on stories set on the eastern seaboard of Canada.</p>
<p>The ending was satisyfing and tidy, though my head reeled from so many twists and turns, none of which I&#8217;d predicted. Em&#8217;s personal growth, as she gains confidence in who she is and what she stands for, was rewarding for the reader. As we part company with her, she is set to move on beyond her bereavement, to advances in her career, and possibly to a new, cautious and gentle relationship with Ben.</p>
<p>The neat conclusion leaves a good set-up for a sequel. It’s always pleasing to discover an enjoyable new series, and I’d be keen to read what Em gets up to next.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">A grisly murder in a sleepy Scottish Borders village opens this debut novel by Janet O&#8217;Kane. The body is discovered by a relative newcomer to the village, who has joined the local surgery as a GP. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Doctor Moreland is the central character and the novel, written in the third person, is told from her point of view. However, it is a distant, almost clinical POV, and given that she survives two attempts on her life, is involved in three suspicious deaths, and is just starting a relationship, I would like to have seen some more intimate third person perspective apart from her doubts about her prospective boyfriend. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">There is a good range of characters, with many of the supporting ones well portrayed, revealing more about them gradually as the novel progresses. The atmosphere of a small village is well created through the use of dialogue and characterisation.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The plot is not just a whodunit but manages to weave different sub-plots neatly into the main story without being distracting and there are some interesting red herrings and twists. The beginning is paced more slowly to set context, and pauses slightly at times with some minor insignificant detail, but as more is revealed later in the book, the pace picks up considerably, and through a number of red herrings and twists, builds up to an unexpected climax.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"> </span>Strengths of this book were characterisation, thoughtful plot (and sub-plots), and the way the story played out. A lot of the story was conveyed through dialogue and was well-written and credible. When the immediate action happened it was very good. There were few literal errors.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Recommended to anyone who likes a mystery/crime novel that focuses on thinking, and one that</span><span lang="EN-GB">—</span><span lang="EN-GB">in its favour</span><span lang="EN-GB">—</span><span lang="EN-GB">isn&#8217;t full of unnecessary gore. It&#8217;s a good first novel.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/writing-tips-avoid-starting-sentences-with-participles/"><img width="890" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/authors-services-890x400.jpg" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="authors-services" /></a><p>Starting sentences with participles, she remembered, was a mark of a hack writer.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>This is what Renni Brown and David King say in the chapter on sophistication in the book ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060545690/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060545690&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lethalinheri-20">Self-Editing for Fiction Writers, Second Edition: How to Edit Yourself into Print</a>. P193.</p>
<p>&#8220;One easy way to make your writing see more sophisticated is to avoid two stylistic constructions that are common to hack writers, namely:</p>
<p>Pulling off her gloves, she turned to face him.</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>As she pulled off her gloves, she turned to face him.</p>
<p>Both the ‘as’ construction and the ‘-ing’ construction as used above are grammatically correct and express the action clearly and unambiguously. But notice that both of these constructions take a bit of action (She pulled off her gloves) and tuck it away into a dependent clause (Pulling off her gloves &#8230;). This tends to place some of your action at one remove from your reader, to make the actions seem incidental, unimportant. If you use these constructions often, you weaken your writing.&#8221;</p>
<p>This little gem of writing knowledge does not seem to be generally available. I learned it from an editor who works for the biggest Australian publishing house. She told me that it can be effective maybe ‘once every 10,000 words’ but that usage over that tends to make the writing ‘flat and samey’. That’s no more than around 8 uses in an ordinary sized novel.</p>
<p>If you think this partial ban on participles ending in &#8216;ing&#8217; heading up sentences is a matter of stylistic choice that you can afford to ignore, show me a book published by the big 6 that overuses this construction, and ask yourself if you’re really willing to ignore the advice of editors that have been editing for mainstream publishers for years?</p>
<p>Besides, how often do sentences starting with a verb ending in ‘ing’ actually sound good? Mostly they sound awkward or bland.</p>
<p>“Running down the road, she got hit by a car. Rolling out of the way, she ended up in the gutter but still alive.”</p>
<p>Yuk. Give me too much of that and I’ll throw your book down in disgust.</p>
<p>And so far, I’ve only talked about the grammatically correct version.</p>
<p><strong>Worse, don’t let your participle dangle.</strong></p>
<p>When you do use a participle phrase make sure that it is connected to a human agency. The word after the comma, should refer to a human not an object.</p>
<p>Wrong: Having been named chairman, the meeting was called by Craig.</p>
<p>Craig was named chairman, not the meeting.</p>
<p>Correct: Having been named chairman, Craig called the meeting.</p>
<p>What is really unfortunate is that some of the books I’ve read that have this problem of overuse of sentences beginning with participles ending in &#8216;ing&#8217; have, according to their authors, been edited by a ‘professional.’ If you want to check if your editor knows what they’re doing, pepper your first few pages with some sentences starting with ‘as’ or an ‘ing ending verb’. If they don’t change all of them, get another editor.</p>

<p><em>The night before the night before Christmas</em> is an adorable heart-warming tale that I would recommend to everyone, young and old. It tells the story of Elfie, one of Santa’s elves who spends the whole day working on one toy, while his comrades rush to complete all the presents for the children of the world.</p>
<p>It holds a sweet message, that sometimes speed and volume of productivity isn’t the best thing. That it’s okay to spend a lot of time on one thing if you make it perfect. This is something that people can forget in this modern age and it’s important to remember this and teach to children.<br />
The story ties together two Christmas traditions in a beautifully understated way. I think linking them like this is a great way of introducing them to children.</p>
<p>The illustrations enhance and complement the story, making you fall in love with the characters immediately. Not to mention how incredibly skilled the artwork is. The entire production of the book is of a highly professional standard. It is a good, large size and comfortable to hold while lying in bed reading to your child, which is just what you want from this kind of children’s book.</p>
<p>I recommend this book for the AIA Seal of Excellence.</p>
