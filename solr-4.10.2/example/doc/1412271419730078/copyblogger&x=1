Maybe you want to double your number of clients. Maybe you have a new plan for <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/small-habits/" target="_blank">positive personal habits</a> you want to implement.</p><p>So you look to the new year.</p><p><span id="more-44290"></span>It&#8217;s a blank slate. Anything and everything is possible. The upcoming year represents a wonderland of potential where your best-laid plans are sure to become your proudest wins and successes.</p><p>Thoughts like these keep us warm, like a fire, on winter nights, while we conspire.</p><p>But warm and fuzzy thoughts eventually have to turn into bold and consistent actions. Otherwise, what good are they?</p><p>That means facing unafraid these plans that you&#8217;ve made.</p><p>Which means taking the first step. </p><h3>No more New Year&#8217;s resolutions</h3><p>Every new year <em>is</em> a blank slate where everything is possible and <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/seth-godin-interview/" target="_blank">plans can become proud successes</a>.</p><p>Of course it is. Every day is exactly that too. Every moment exactly that as well.</p><p>Which is why waiting for January 1, 2015 to begin executing on a plan already in your head is arbitrary at best, fearful and self-defeating at worst.</p><p>Why are you waiting? Why not take the first step, no matter how small, right <em>now.</em></p><p>Face unafraid, these plans that you&#8217;ve made. </p><p>Because if you&#8217;re waiting for the &#8220;fresh start&#8221; of 2015 to get started on some new idea, initiative, or plan, what you&#8217;re really doing is letting fear get the best of you. And you&#8217;re better than that. We all are.  </p><p>You have a fresh start tomorrow, December 25, if you want it. You have a fresh start as soon as you finish reading this article, if you want it. Heck, if you&#8217;ve already read enough, you can stop reading this article right now and get a fresh start immed&#8211;.</p><p>You get the idea. </p><p>Only fear, family, or egg nog are preventing you from taking the first step on your new year journey right now. Once the egg nog wears off, just find a few private moments away from family at some point over the next week &#8230; and then all you have left to do is vanquish the fear and step into the new year (a week early). </p><p>That&#8217;s how you face unafraid, these plans that you&#8217;ve made. </p><h3>What one little step can you do right now?</h3><p>So what is your biggest goal or initiative &#8212; personal or professional &#8212; for 2015? What plans are you waiting for the first day of January to get started on?</p><p>And what <em>one</em> step can you take over the next week to get started <em>now?</em> To start building positive momentum immediately?</p><p>Don&#8217;t worry about thinking beyond that one step. It will inevitably lead to a second, then a third. Just take the first one. You&#8217;ll already be way ahead of the alternative &#8212; which was waiting for the new year. </p><p>Don&#8217;t do that. Don&#8217;t wait. Instead, embrace the new <em>here</em>. Embrace the now.</p><p>Face unafraid, the plans that you&#8217;ve made.  </p><p>And walk into your winning wonderland.</p><hr /><p>Want a place to publicly declare your biggest goal for 2015 and the step you&#8217;re taking now to get started on it?

Content that tempts your readers</h3><p><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/native-advertising-2014/" target="_blank">Native advertising</a> can be a subtle sidestep away from promoting a product outright. When done properly, you offer valuable information and a clear call to action.  </p><p>For example, Guinness&#8217;s famous adverts <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/examples-of-native-ads/" target="_blank">teach the reader about cheese and oysters</a> in ways that paint delicious pictures.</p><p>The brand tempts you to partner your favorite nibble with Ireland&#8217;s famous tipple, and the information is helpful even if you choose not to drink Guinness.  </p><p>Let&#8217;s also look at temptations you can put in place on <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com/" target="_blank">your own digital media platform</a>. </p><p>KISSmetrics provides analytics software for businesses. Many software providers point prospects directly towards a free trial, and the KISSmetrics home page does the same.  </p><p>However, their <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/customer-experience-maps/" target="_blank">smart content marketing strategy</a> includes offering free guides that visitors can use even if they&#8217;re not ready to buy or start a free trial. </p><p>The guides are targeted towards the pain points of an ideal customer and also dovetail the features offered by the services they provide. </p><p>They have tips on color psychology to increase website conversions, how to know what metrics to track in your marketing, conversion optimization case studies, and more. </p><p>Each one deals with a specific challenge and shows prospects how to solve them &#8212; without making any purchase. </p><p>However, KISSmetrics knows that if it can help businesses tackle analytics problems, they can tempt a prospect with the promise of bigger results if the prospect signs up. </p><p>Once that temptation is there, promoting a trial or sales conversation is going to be much easier. It&#8217;s a clever way of using a low-resistance opt-in to start (and continue) a relationship with a prospect. </p><h3>2. Content that makes readers hungry for more</h3><p>We know that it&#8217;s easier and more cost-effective to get a current customer to buy again than it is to acquire new customers. </p><p>In the UK, the breakfast cereal brand Shredded Wheat had a long-running advertising campaign during the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s that encouraged customers to eat more of the cereal than they typically would. </p><p>The advertising suggested that the cereal was so nourishing, it was impossible to eat three, full-size servings (a standard bowl contained two). </p><p>The company displayed celebrity athletes known for their fitness and endurance who were unable to finish a third serving of Shredded Wheat.  </p><p>As a result, people felt dared to eat three bowls rather than the usual two. </p><p>But, of course, your methods have to be ethical. Using more of your product has to actually benefit your customers. </p><p>For example, Canva lets you make simple, cost-effective (often free) graphics you can use in your blog posts, presentations, or documents. I love using it for <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/simple-captivating-drawings/" target="_blank">blog illustrations</a> and, because I&#8217;m not a designer, I love their tips even more. </p><p>Occasionally they&#8217;ll send emails telling me how to do new and nifty designs with graphics and text.</p><p>The result? I&#8217;m encouraged to use the service more regularly, which means I&#8217;m more likely to purchase their images for my illustrations. </p><p>What&#8217;s great about Canva&#8217;s content is that their free tutorials are bite-size, specific, and easy to implement. </p><p>Instead of providing a tutorial that says &#8220;how to get the best from Canva,&#8221; they provide niche subjects, such as &#8220;how to make pictures look retro&#8221; or &#8220;how to use text and images effectively.&#8221; </p><p>You can quickly evaluate whether or not a tutorial is relevant to your needs.</p><p>If you can teach your customer specific ways to use your product, you will make them hungry for more information and more inclined to spend money with you.</p><h3>3. Content that provides upfront results for your readers</h3><p>With content marketing, people who consume your content should be able to get value and experience some results without having to purchase anything. </p><p>This can make certain businesses nervous because they feel customers will just use the free content without making a purchase. In my experience, that doesn&#8217;t tend to happen. </p><p>Yes, you will encounter people who consume your content and never make a purchase, but you will also attract more people who use your content, experience results, and subsequently: </p><ul><li>Trust you.</li><li>View you as an <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~getauthority.com" target="_blank">authority</a>.</li><li>Become more interested in your paid offerings.</li></ul><p>Copyblogger is a trendsetter for giving away free content that helps readers get results. The blog <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~copyblogger.com/rethink-content-marketing" target="_blank">built an audience</a> and then turned hundreds of thousands of readers into more than 115,000 unique customers. </p><p>Today, consumers demand more proof up front before they buy, and one way you can stand out and provide value is to give them content that produces results they can actually see. </p><p>Karen Knowler is another example. She&#8217;s one of the UK&#8217;s leading raw food coaches, and her free gift is a guide for trying a raw lifestyle for just for 24 hours.</p><p>But she also provides a content checklist for readers to assess how they feel before they try her menus and recipes.

You&#8217;ve <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/rethink-content-marketing/" target="_blank">built an audience</a> and overcome the obscurity problem.</p><p>The number of links pointing to your site grows every day, social shares to your content rise with each passing moment, and you&#8217;ve recently started creating products and services your audience loves and buys.</p><p>It&#8217;s safe to say you&#8217;ve reached your hockey stick moment and handily solved the sustainability question, too. You are finally making money as a blogger (the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com/audio/seth-godin-interview/" target="_blank">impresario</a>), which has allowed you to quit your job.</p><p>It is so satisfying after all you&#8217;ve been through. So what could possibly be bothering you?</p><p><span id="more-44766"></span>It&#8217;s strange, but you feel like something terrible is going to happen &#8230; that all of this will be taken from you.</p><p>In my <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/full-time-blogger/" target="_blank">last blog post on this topic</a>, I showed you the two concerns that will plague you in the first stage of becoming a content producer (and how to overcome them).</p><p>Now, in this second stage, you have a new set of concerns.</p><p>They boil down to these five issues &#8230;</p><h3>1. Will your website crash?</h3><p>You&#8217;ve seen it happen once or twice before. </p><p>A <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.techradar.com/news/internet/how-stephen-fry-takes-down-entire-websites-with-a-single-tweet-674170" target="_blank">hotshot</a> &#8212; someone with more than 200,000 Twitter followers or a Facebook page pushing one million fans &#8212; shares a link to a web page on your site.</p><p>And it&#8217;s like a whale striking the side of a boat. </p><p>The site blinks &#8230; and then lights out. Traffic is too heavy. The site can&#8217;t cope. So it sinks.</p><p>What most of those thousands of visitors saw was a white screen. An ugly white screen. They wandered away wondering if it was some kind of joke.</p><p>They replied to the hotshot who shared the link: &#8220;Bum link&#8221; or &#8220;Nothing but a 404.&#8221;</p><p>And the hotshot, while sympathetic to your predicament, is embarrassed. He or she will probably never share another link to your site again.</p><p>Traffic lost. Sales gone. Credibility damaged.</p><h3>2. Does your website load fast enough?</h3><p>Maybe it&#8217;s just a small fear. Maybe you&#8217;re simply concerned about your web pages bogging down while loading (<a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/23/speeding-up-your-websites-database/" target="_blank">Google considers 1.5 seconds slow</a>).</p><p>There&#8217;s a host of culprits: large files, javascript, analytics code, plugins, uncompressed images &#8230; they all can slow down a web page.</p><p>We all know it&#8217;s silly, but people simply refuse to wait more than three seconds for a page to load. After three seconds, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/" target="_blank">40 percent of visitors will abandon the page</a>. </p><p>So how are you going to compete with web pages that take less than one second to load?</p><p>Start by testing your site <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h3>3. Can you afford to have your website hacked?</h3><p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/44-percent-small-businesses-hacked.png" alt="44-percent-small-businesses-hacked" width="650" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46241" /></p><p>A third concern website owners face is web security. And unless you work in the web security industry, this is strange territory for just about all of us.</p><p>But what we know for certain is that there are some bad guys out there who want to do naughty things to your site &#8212; just for the fun of it.</p><p>According to a <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/10/12/small-business-hacking-dangers/17041613/" target="_blank">2013 survey by the National Small Business Association</a>, 44 percent of small businesses have been attacked. </p><p>As a result, those companies paid out-of-pocket recovery costs averaging $8,700. Most of us don&#8217;t have that kind of money in our budgets.</p><p>Typically, if you&#8217;ve been a victim of a hack, you hire a security consultant to identify the source of the attack and purge any malware. Plus, if customer data was breached, you are obligated to inform customers of the intrusion and foot the bill for costs incurred.</p><p>In addition, many states encourage businesses to pay for credit monitoring for each customer. Not to mention you might face lawsuits.</p><p>At the very least, you&#8217;ll suffer a credibility hit when customers feel like you can&#8217;t protect the data they entrusted to you.</p><p>While you can certainly overcome such a customer breach, it&#8217;s best to prevent it from happening in the first place.</p><p>And let&#8217;s not forget about the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/wordpress-website-security/" target="_blank">threats to WordPress</a> in particular.</p><h3>4. Will Google punish you if your site isn&#8217;t mobile-friendly?</h3><p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/61-percent-never-return-trouble-mobile.png" alt="61-percent-never-return-trouble-mobile" width="650" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46243" /></p><p>The answer is <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~mobilemixed.com/google-demotion-with-no-mobile-website/" target="_blank">yes</a>. </p><p>Why? <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.stonetemple.com/googles-gary-illyes-discusses-mobile-as-a-ranking-factor/" target="_blank">Google is putting mobile users first</a>, which is one of the reasons they gave for <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://plus.google.com/+JohnMueller/posts/HZf3KDP1Dm8" target="_blank">killing Authorship snippets</a>.</p><p>If your site isn&#8217;t compliant with their mobile-first guidelines, then you might see a drop in your rankings.</p><p>Use this Google tool to <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/?utm_source=wmc-blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mobile-friendly" target="_blank">test if a web page is mobile-friendly</a>.</p><p>As <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.stonetemple.com/googles-gary-illyes-discusses-mobile-as-a-ranking-factor/" target="_blank">Google&#8217;s Gary Illyes said</a>, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s pretty clear that mobile-friendly websites provide a much better user experience for the mobile users.&#8221; </p><p>This is consistent with <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~googlemobileads.blogspot.ch/2012/09/mobile-friendly-sites-turn-visitors.html" target="_blank">studies that reveal</a> &#8220;61 percent of users are unlikely to return to a mobile site that they had trouble accessing from their phone and mobile-friendly sites turn visitors into customers</a>.&#8221;</p><p>Fortunately, becoming mobile friendly doesn&#8217;t have to be labor-intensive. Which brings me to my next point.</p><h3>5. Can you do <em>all of this</em> without being overwhelmed?</h3><p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/no-plan-for-hack-or-infection.png" alt="no-plan-for-hack-or-infection" width="650" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46244" /></p><p>The challenges of running a successful business are legion. It&#8217;s easy to feel overwhelmed.</p><p>For example, through our <strong>2015 Cost of Doing Business Online Survey</strong> (full results will be released on January 5, 2015), we discovered that more than 40 percent of online business owners spend between <em>two and eight hours each day working on their websites</em>, but more than half of those who took the survey are either <em>barely paying the bills</em> or <em>failing (soon to shut the doors)</em>.</p><p>Since you can only do so much in a day, you have to prioritize your tasks &#8212; generating leads and making sales top your list. Then other tasks, like web security or mobile-friendly design, fall to the wayside.</p><p>In fact, more than one third of online business owners said they don&#8217;t have a plan of action in place to take care of a hack or infection &#8212; and half said the reason is that they are new to web security. Another seventeen percent said they feel like it won&#8217;t happen to them. Another third said they simply don&#8217;t have the time.</p><p>In the end, what we&#8217;re talking about at this stage of the online business owner&#8217;s journey is <em>performance</em>.</p><p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if you didn&#8217;t have to worry about web security? Whether Google will harass you? How to keep people from bailing on your site because it loads slowly? Whether your site can handle a sudden surge of traffic?</p><h3>Spend more time in front of your audience &#8212; not your servers</h3><p>You want to stop hunting down plugins (and wondering if they work). You want to focus on marketing and content creation. You want to stop worrying about your website and focus on your business. </p><p>In other words, you want to preserve your hard-fought-for revenue stream without having to spend your time staring at your servers. Instead, you want to be in front of your audience more often. And, of course, you want it all to be push-button easy.</p><p>You can have it that way when you work on the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com/" target="_blank">Rainmaker Platform</a>. </p><p>It takes care of your performance concerns without digging deep into your pockets. </p><p>As Seth Spears put it:</p><blockquote><p>Copyblogger Media has created a game changer for bloggers and content marketers who want the ability to create beautiful membership sites, optimize and sell digital content, continue their marketing education, track their metrics, and never have to worry about the technical side of their website.</p></blockquote><div class="gray-box now-do-this"><div class="inner"><br><h3>Try the Rainmaker Platform for free &#8230;</h3><p>Right now, you can <strong>take the Rainmaker Platform for a 14-day spin at no charge</strong> and get the type of performance that protects and preserves your powerful online marketing and sales engine.</p><p><strong>For more information, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com/platform/tour/#performance" target="_blank">click right here</a>.</strong></div></div><p><em>Flickr Creative Commons Image via <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.flickr.com/photos/captain_die/12672588043/" target="_blank">Alexander Rentsch</a>.</em></p><div class="author-box"><div><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/81c83444aed195de41d9e227bf13c2dc?s=100&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D100&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-100 photo' height='100' width='100' /> <span class="subheading">About the author</span><h3>Demian Farnworth</h3><br><p>Demian Farnworth is Copyblogger Media's Chief Copywriter.

Why not just <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~copyblogger.com/content-marketing" target="_blank">build the audience first</a> and then develop the product once you <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/empathy-maps/" target="_blank">truly understand the needs of the audience</a>?  </p><p>I believe this is the go-to-market strategy for businesses in the future &#8212; so much so that my next book is about this exact topic. </p><p>Don&#8217;t believe me? I&#8217;m amazed by the amount of contemporary businesses that have had success with this method; build the audience first and then create the product later. </p><p>Your own Brian Clark, founder of Copyblogger Media, created content for 19 months without offering a product. Over that time, he worked to build a loyal audience (and succeeded).</p><p>Today, Copyblogger Media is one of the fastest growing SaaS (software as a service) companies on the planet.</p><p>For me, personally, I launched a blog on April 26, 2007. For 14 months all we did was build an audience. Then, we launched our first product in June of 2008.</p><p>Today, the Content Marketing Institute has been named to the Inc. 500 list of fastest growing private companies three years in a row.</p><p>Social Media Examiner, Moz, Smosh TV, and Lauren Luke have all done the same; they built multi-million-dollar businesses by doing one simple thing &#8212; building an audience. Product development and sales came later.</p><h3>Rethinking the model</h3><p>Billy Beane, as General Manager of the Oakland A&#8217;s, had none of the resources of a large-market team for putting a championship baseball team together. </p><p>But by focusing on a rarely used statistic, the On-Base Percentage (OBP), he restructured his team. That year, Oakland broke the American League record for most consecutive wins (20) with one of the lowest payrolls in Major League Baseball. </p><p>Today, the majority of MLB teams leverage the components of Beane&#8217;s philosophy.</p><p>Paul Westhead, the basketball coach for Loyola Marymount from 1988–1990, threw out the traditional basketball playbook and focused on shooting as many times as humanly possible during a game.</p><p>He held the simple belief that having significantly more shooting attempts than the competition would tip the scales in Loyola&#8217;s favor. </p><p>Over those three years, Loyola led the country in scoring, with an amazing 122.4 points per game in 1990 (the all-time NCAA record).</p><p>Better yet, this small program nearly went all the way to the Final Four that year (losing to UNLV).</p><p>In 2013, Chip Kelly left college football powerhouse Oregon to coach in the National Football League (NFL) for the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p>Kelly espoused the theory that a faster-moving offense, which eliminates the amount of seconds between plays, would create a competitive advantage and keep defenses without the ability to substitute.</p><p>Through this philosophy, Kelly turned the Eagles program around, and now, into one of the most successful franchises in football. Kelly&#8217;s offensive strategy has redefined the league, with many teams converting to his system.</p><p>Why did I just tell you these three stories?</p><p>Because each of the three make an incredible amount of sense, but at the time, they were &#8220;different&#8221; than what others did.</p><p>In the future, thousands of businesses from around the globe will leverage the power of building an audience as go-to-market strategy.</p><p>Why? Not just because you are first and foremost building a loyal audience directly, but also because having a singular focus on audience gives you the best understanding of the most beneficial products to sell. </p><p>Whether you already have a product or are just getting started, here are five steps you need to take now to attract and retain future customers of your product or service.</p><h3>Step 1. Choose the right content niche</h3><p>Select a content niche where you have at least a chance of being the leading informational provider in your industry. </p><p>Your content should be the very best in your industry &#8212; better than all your competitors&#8217; and better than that of the media and publishers in your space. </p><p>How can you be the leading, trusted expert in your industry if it is not? The key to that happening is choosing a focused niche where that goal is not out of your reach.</p><h3>Step 2. Focus all your efforts on building an opt-in email list</h3><p>Your content should have one call to action, and that is to sign up for your email list. The goal of any content you produce is to get and keep a subscriber. </p><p>Remove other calls to action in your content. Fans and followers are great, but you don&#8217;t own them. </p><p>I can&#8217;t remember a time when <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~copyblogger.com/email-marketing" target="_blank">email marketing</a> has been more critical or important.</p><h3>Step 3. Produce content consistently</h3><p>Content delivery on a regular schedule is a promise to your reader. Don&#8217;t break your promise. </p><p>A blog post should be published at the same time each day or each week, depending on your schedule. Your email newsletter should be sent regularly without fail.</p><p>To become the &#8220;must see TV&#8221; of your industry, your subscribers need to know when to tune in.</p><h3>Step 4. Add &#8220;outcomes&#8221; to your editorial calendar</h3><p>To implement this step, you need to add an extra section to your editorial calendar.</p><p>An &#8220;outcome&#8221; is the problem you solve for the reader, and a central focus for your editorial team.</p><p>How are you making your readers&#8217; lives better? If your content doesn&#8217;t answer that question, try again.</p><h3>Step 5. Prepare the three-legged stool model</h3><p>The greatest media companies in the world don&#8217;t only focus on digital content. Look at ESPN, the <em>New York Times</em>, or the <em>Huffington Post</em>.</p><p>If you want to become the leading media company in your industry, plan to dominate multiple content channels, including digital, print, and events.</p><h3>It all begins with the audience</h3><p>No matter what your ultimate revenue source is, whether you sell advertising, paid content, consulting services, or a manufactured product, you&#8217;ll achieve your goals with more ease if you focus your content creation energy on building a loyal audience.  </p><p>Now is the time.</p><div class="gray-box now-do-this"><div class="inner"><br><h3>Want to take your content marketing to the next level?</h3><p>Joe Pulizzi is among the powerhouse lineup of speakers who will be presenting at <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~authorityrainmaker.com" target="_blank">Authority Rainmaker</a> May 13–15, 2015 in Denver, Colorado.

You settle on a picture that&#8217;s <em>okay</em>. You&#8217;d love to hire a professional illustrator, but you don&#8217;t have the budget. Not yet. </p><p>Sometimes you wonder if a better source of images exists. </p><p>What if you could create your own images to clarify your ideas? What if your custom images could make readers smile and draw them closer to you? Images that make you <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/full-time-blogger/" target="_blank">stand out online</a>?</p><p>Sound far-fetched? </p><p>Read on and we&#8217;ll show you how anyone &#8212; even you &#8212; can draw images. No art school required. No fancy tools necessary. </p><p><span id="more-44765"></span>First, let&#8217;s take a quick look at the benefits of simple images.</p><h3>Why simple drawings?</h3><p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/images-that-make-you-smile.jpg" alt="images-that-make-you-smile" width="650" height="325" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46143" /></p><p>Photoshopped images make your site look slick.</p><p>That&#8217;s true. </p><p>But do they connect with your readers? Clichéd images make you look like millions of other blogs on the web. </p><p>Have you ever arrived at a blog for the first time and wondered if you&#8217;d been there before? Generic images trick you into thinking you&#8217;ve already been to the website because you&#8217;ve seen them before. </p><p>Hand-drawn images add a personal touch to your website. They&#8217;re unique &#8212; crafted to match your content. </p><p>Just as your writing voice is one of a kind, your imagery can be unique, too. Just as your voice adds a dash of personality, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/use-images/" target="_blank">your images can add an authentic touch</a>. </p><p>But drawing your own images produces more value than just personality and branding. These drawings aren&#8217;t simply decorations. These images explain the essence of your ideas.</p><p>They communicate your message. They captivate your audience. They make your message more memorable.</p><p>Research has suggested that: </p><ul><li>Images can increase the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/articles/persuade-with-pictures.htm" target="_blank">credibility of your content</a>.</li><li>Images <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Show-Me-What-Brain-Research-Says-About-Visuals-in-PowerPoint-8b802fd7-59d6-47c9-b4df-472aa5f18f09" target="_blank">require less brain processing time</a> than text because text is a symbol system that first must be decoded. </li><li>Images improve <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15950838" target="_blank">understanding</a> and <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Show-Me-What-Brain-Research-Says-About-Visuals-in-PowerPoint-8b802fd7-59d6-47c9-b4df-472aa5f18f09" target="_blank">memory recall</a>.</li></ul><p>Research also suggests people read <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/" target="_blank">only 28 percent of words</a> on an average web page. And they decide within 10 seconds whether or not to linger around. </p><p>Could simple images draw people into reading your content? </p><p>Simple images are quick to draw, and you don&#8217;t have to buy them. You might even find that readers engage more with hand-drawn images because they are more personal. </p><p>As bestselling author, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.danroam.com/" target="_blank">Dan Roam</a>, suggests, the roughness of these simple images makes them more inviting and less intimidating. </p><h3>Think you can&#8217;t draw? </h3><p>Worried you lack talent? </p><p>Everyone can draw. Everyone is an artist. </p><p>Didn&#8217;t you think you were an artist when you were four years old? Didn&#8217;t you enjoy drawing as a kid?</p><blockquote><p>So long as you can draw a stick figure, you&#8217;re well on your way to being able to create simple stories that explain your ideas better than any well-crafted words could. ~ <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~rosenfeldmedia.com/books/see-what-i-mean/" target="_blank">Kevin Cheng</a></p></blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s a simple exercise to get you started.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Draw a square, a circle, a line, and a triangle:  </p><p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/square-circle-line-triangle.jpg" alt="square-circle-line-triangle" width="650" height="201" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46144" /></p><p>That&#8217;s easy, right? </p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Notice how almost any object can be drawn using squares, circles, triangles, and lines. Try drawing a few objects with this method: </p><p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/drawing-objects-from-simple-shapes.jpg" alt="drawing-objects-from-simple-shapes" width="650" height="199" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46145" /></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Images don&#8217;t require any words to transmit ideas. Review these examples: </p><p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/drawing-ideas-without-words.jpg" alt="drawing-ideas-without-words" width="650" height="201" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46146" /></p><p>You see? </p><p>You don&#8217;t need to draw a masterpiece to communicate your message.</p><h3>How to translate your ideas into simple drawings</h3><p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/clarifying-ideas.jpg" alt="clarifying-ideas" width="650" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46147" /></p><p>Communicating your ideas with stick figures isn&#8217;t about whether or not you have drawing talent. It&#8217;s about distilling your idea into a simple drawing. It&#8217;s about making abstract statements concrete, so you can <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/copy-editing-tips/" target="_blank">communicate your ideas with clarity</a>. </p><p>Want to know how? </p><p>In his book, <em><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.danroam.com/the-back-of-the-napkin/" target="_blank">The Back of the Napkin</a></em>, Dan Roam suggests a four-step process for visual thinking. </p><ol><li><strong>Look</strong> at the material in your blog post.</li><li><strong>See</strong> which point in your content is most valuable to your reader.</li><li><strong>Imagine</strong> the best way to convey your message.</li><li><strong>Show</strong> your message in a simple drawing.</li></ol><p>Let&#8217;s see how visual thinking works in practice by looking at Henneke&#8217;s Copyblogger guest post about <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/37-email-marketing-tips/" target="_blank">37 email marketing tips</a>. </p><p>How could you create a simple drawing by hand to accompany the post? Follow these three steps:</p><ol><li>Read the post a few times and consider which of the 37 points you should illustrate.</li><li>Note that the key takeaway is to treat people on your email list like friends.</li><li>How can you illustrate the idea of treating people like friends? Perhaps people hugging each other, children playing together, a love letter, or &#8230;</li></ol><p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/illustration-for-37-email-marketing-tips.jpg" alt="illustration-for-37-email-marketing-tips" width="650" height="217" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46148" /></p><p>Let&#8217;s look at another example. Here&#8217;s how we brainstormed the featured illustration at the top of this post: </p><ol><li>We outlined the post and wrote it together, covering the reasons why simple images work and tips for creating your own images. </li><li>While discussing the post, we found that its essence is the contrast between simple drawings and clichéd stock photos &#8212; a drawing is more than a mere decoration; it&#8217;s a clarification of your idea.  </li><li>We then decided to draw a simple stick figure confused by the ubiquitous call center gal.</li></ol><p>Here&#8217;s a drawing of the process:</p><p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/image-brainstorming-process.jpg" alt="image-brainstorming-process" width="650" height="197" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46149" /></p><p>Distilling the essence of your post into simple drawings forces you to focus on your big idea. What do you really want to communicate? </p><p>The process makes your content clearer and more persuasive.</p><h3>How to upload, publish, and share your images</h3><p>Once you&#8217;ve written a post and hand-drawn a few images, what&#8217;s the quickest way to upload them to your site? And how do you get your images shared on social media? </p><p>Follow these six simple tips:</p><ol><li><strong>Use basic tools.</strong> The easiest way to publish your images is hand-drawing them on paper, making sure the paper is clean and not crumpled. Scan your drawing or take a picture with your smartphone or tablet. </li><li><strong>Add text.</strong> Raw handwriting works, but if you&#8217;d like the text you add to your images to appear in a  polished font, you can <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~louisem.com/4344/add-text-to-pictures-free-photo-editor" target="_blank">use a free editor</a> like the one you&#8217;ll find on Pixlr.com.</li><li><strong>Re-size appropriately.</strong> Keep in mind that large images increase loading time. When re-sizing your image, be careful not to change your drawing&#8217;s proportions because your image will <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~usefulgraphicdesigntutorials.com/resizing-photos/" target="_blank">look squashed or stretched</a>. </li><li><strong>Make your pictures the same dimensions.</strong> For a consistent look, you can crop your drawings with free photo editing tools to remove excess white areas. </li><li><strong>Prepare image ratios for social media.</strong> The recommended image ratio is different for each social media channel. <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~boostblogtraffic.com/social-metadata/" target="_blank">Use metadata</a> to properly display different images on different channels.

I&#8217;m your host, Jerod Morris.</p><p>This episode of The Lede is brought to you by <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~AuthorityRainmaker.com" target="_blank">Authority Rainmaker</a>, Copyblogger&#8217;s second annual live conference focused on providing content marketing training and networking opportunities for real-world results. </p><p>Authority Rainmaker takes place in May 2015 and will be held at the stunning Ellie Caulkins Opera House in Denver, Colorado. </p><p>Keynote presentations will be delivered by Daniel Pink, Sally Hogshead, and Henry Rollins. Yes, I said Henry Rollins. You won&#8217;t want to miss it. </p><p>Super early bird pricing is still available. Go to <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~AuthorityRainmaker.com" target="_blank">AuthorityRainmaker.com</a> for details.</p><p>For those of us who work online, each new year seems to bring with it a new buzz term or two describing a concept that will, supposedly, change how we do our jobs. How we reach an audience. How we build and grow a business. </p><p>Think back: Search engine optimization, SEO, was once a buzz term. </p><p>It described an innovative method for leveraging a growing understanding of search engine algorithms into a search-focused content strategy that would rank your site higher, send more visitors, and make all of your wildest dreams come true. </p><p>SEO certainly delivered on the buzz. </p><p>Now it&#8217;s a mature concept, and though a successful SEO strategy means something vastly different from what it meant back then, the concept itself is still very relevant. </p><p>Needless to say, if you were in early on SEO, way back when it was just a baby buzz term, you probably carved out a sizable, profitable online niche for yourself. </p><p><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com/platform/tour/#design" target="_blank">Mobile responsive design</a> is another example. That has been a big buzz term over the past few years, and it helped usher in a revolution in how web pages are designed. </p><p>Now mobile responsiveness isn&#8217;t just nice to have, it&#8217;s a prerequisite. But other buzz terms don&#8217;t always deliver on their promise. </p><p>If you listened to <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/lede-reflections-2014/" target="_blank">the last episode of The Lede</a>, you heard our discussion on Google Authorship. Getting in early on that buzz term was a smart bet, but unfortunately, it isn&#8217;t paying you much of a dividend today.</p><p>So the question now as we look ahead to 2015 is what buzz concept should you be paying attention to? </p><p>Because if there is a concept that is starting to pick up steam, and that could revolutionize online business like SEO did, you&#8217;re going to want to get in on it at the ground floor. </p><p>Guess what? There is. </p><p>It&#8217;s going to be a big focus for us at Copyblogger in 2015, and we think it&#8217;s something that you should start thinking about, too. </p><p>I&#8217;m referring to adaptive content, and it is the subject of today&#8217;s episode of The Lede. Let&#8217;s bring in my co-host, Demian Farnworth, to learn more.</p><p>Demian, to begin, let&#8217;s just provide a working definition of adaptive content so that all of the listeners are on the same page with us. </p><p>What is adaptive content? What does that mean?</p><h3>What is adaptive content?</h3><p><strong>Demian Farnworth:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question because I don&#8217;t know if I entirely know for certain what it is. </p><p>It&#8217;s not a concrete term, that&#8217;s for sure. There are a lot of working definitions, so there&#8217;s kind of a spectrum. </p><p>I think it was <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~todaymade.com/blog/adaptive-content/" target="_blank">Garrett Moon from CoSchedule who talked about adaptive content</a> as this idea of creating once, then publishing everywhere, which is actually the policy that NPR had with all their content. </p><p>You create once, and then you reduce, re-use, and recycle. </p><p>This is a concept that we&#8217;ve used here at Copyblogger, and we&#8217;ve talked about this before with the asset pillar, especially with infographics. </p><p>You create one piece of content, and then build something new out of that instead of always re-inventing the wheel. </p><p>That idea of adaptive content is helpful, but there are other interpretations. Adaptive content in the design world can be thought of as adaptive design.</p><p>I&#8217;m going all over this research, and I&#8217;m reading all these articles on adaptive content, and what I keep on hearing is personalization. That&#8217;s what it reminds me of. </p><p>But it&#8217;s actually taking that a little bit further. But we&#8217;ve seen this before, right? You get an email from a marketer, and your first or last name is on there, or maybe they know something about your address or your buying habits &#8212; that&#8217;s personalization. </p><p>Amazon&#8217;s recommendation engine is personalization. </p><p>It&#8217;s all rule-based, right? It&#8217;s all based upon this figuring out: Okay, if he does X, then Y, then we think he&#8217;ll appreciate Z. All we&#8217;re trying to do &#8212; search engines, marketers &#8212; is guess the intent of it. </p><p>That rule-base is very primitive, and it&#8217;s very wooden, and personalization &#8212; adaptive content &#8212; is this concept of crafting an experience that is tailored to that user&#8217;s, that customer&#8217;s experience, behavior, and desires. </p><p>It&#8217;s sort of like everything that we&#8217;ve been studying &#8212; experience maps, empathy maps &#8212; and what we&#8217;ve been saying for so long about creating an experience. </p><p>We deliver content to them based upon who they are, their behaviors. I&#8217;ve got two examples for you.</p><h3>Two examples of opportunities to create adaptive content</h3><p>First, for example, buying an airline ticket. </p><p>On LinkedIn, Mars Cyrillo, a product and marketing VP, said a lot of times when we buy an airline ticket, we&#8217;ll go onto American Airlines&#8217;s website, find the ticket, and then we might shoot over to Expedia to actually buy the ticket. </p><p>Well, adaptive content would be American Airlines recognizing that people do that, and then delivering some sort of incentive or content that would keep visitors on their site. </p><p>Another great example was by Noz Urbina on Content Marketing Institute where <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~contentmarketinginstitute.com/2014/09/adaptive-content-omni-channel-technique/" target="_blank">he wrote about a wine-tasting adventure</a> with his partner. </p><p>They actually had tablets at the table, but he said they missed a great opportunity because an adaptive content experience would have easily allowed you to check in through social media, which a lot of us do. A lot of companies do that. </p><p>But then for this wine tasting, what they should have done was display a personal welcome screen on the tablet that they gave, and allowed people to add items to the shopping cart that would then add to their final bill so that when they went to the cash register, they paid for what they drank there. </p><p>What it comes down to is this merging of the offline and online world. </p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> If we look at this in terms of the opportunity that it presents for marketers: When you think about marketing, if we have the opportunity to speak directly to every single person in our market &#8212; to talk with them, to learn about them, to build kind of that individualized sales pitch &#8212; think about how powerful that would be. </p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Well, obviously online we can&#8217;t necessarily do that, right? </p><p>We create content. We put it out there, and you try to understand your audience in a macro sense so that the content that you&#8217;re creating will fit  macro needs and macro desires as much as possible. </p><p>But tell me if this is on the right track: Adaptive content would almost allow you to have that personal experience, talk to one person through content online that adapts based on who they are, what device they&#8217;re viewing it from, what they&#8217;ve done in the past, and what you know about them. </p><p>It serves up almost a customized experience for them that is different from what another person gets. Each experience is individualized to have maximum impact. </p><p>Is that the big idea or ultimate goal with it?</p><h3>Using experience maps to create individualized paths for your customer</h3><p><strong>Demian:</strong> I think that&#8217;s the place that we&#8217;d all like to be in &#8212; that place where, like you said, it&#8217;s one-on-one marketing. </p><p>I&#8217;ve been in this business for more than 15 years, and I&#8217;ve heard this. This is what we want, and this is the best place to be in because when you do that customers appreciate it. </p><p>Here&#8217;s the thing, too, you&#8217;ve got to keep in mind. All of our expectations have been raised because of technology.</p><p>We all use our phones when we&#8217;re shopping. We use them when we&#8217;re inside brick-and-mortars. We think &#8212; when we&#8217;re in an environment &#8212; wouldn&#8217;t it be great if they did <em>this</em>? If I use my phone, wouldn&#8217;t it be great if I could do <em>that</em>? </p><p>Or, I have this tablet now, wouldn&#8217;t it be great if I could do that? And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to get to, like you said.</p><p>It&#8217;s this very individual, customized experience. What we&#8217;re actually trying to do is guess the intent of the customer&#8217;s behavior. </p><p>It comes back to <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/empathy-maps/" target="_blank">crawling inside the mind of the customer</a> and figuring out who they are.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> So as another example, let&#8217;s say someone has an email marketing program that they&#8217;re doing, right? </p><p>They have a set of autoresponders. And so you send out one autoresponder. A person clicks on a link, and maybe the next link he&#8217;s sent is different based on the fact that he clicked a certain link.</p><p>Someone who didn&#8217;t click on the link in that first autoresponder, because he may not be interested in it, he then gets a different experience each step of the way.</p><p>It&#8217;s almost like choosing your own adventure, right?</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> If you make a choice on this &#8230;</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Right.</p><h3>How to overcome the challenges of creating adaptive content</h3><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Let me ask you this, then, because it all sounds perfect. If we could do that, the possibilities there are obvious. </p><p>So, what are the challenges to making this readily adoptable?</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question. The disadvantage of this is that the technology is not really there. It&#8217;s there, but you have to piece things together, and it&#8217;s kind of clunky. </p><p>When I say the technology&#8217;s not there, I mean it&#8217;s not easy to do. You have to figure these things out. </p><p>That disadvantage, though, is the perfect opportunity for companies to say, &#8220;How can we make software solutions to make adaptive content easier?&#8221; </p><p>This is <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/lede-journey-maps/" target="_blank">what we talked about with the experience map</a>. Imagine really creating the experience map so you understand the customer experience. </p><p>But really <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/customer-experience-maps/" target="_blank">what you&#8217;re after is that prescriptive map</a>, right? The way things should be. The superior experience. And so create that. </p><p>That&#8217;s when you say, &#8220;Okay, so how do we get there? What kind of technology do we need to build in order to get to that place?&#8221; </p><p>Of course, the other disadvantage is the resources to create the content. Because you and I talk about this.</p><p>We have all these emails, and if we have six avatars, that means we have six different paths, and each of those paths break off two, or three, or four different times. We&#8217;ve got a lot of content to create, then. </p><p>Those two aspects are challenges: having the technology and then actually creating the content. </p><h3>Finding the right technology to implement adaptive content</h3><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> That technology part is going to be a huge barrier for you or I on our personal sites. </p><p>It would be very hard for us to develop that kind of infrastructure to build out the adaptive content. So, I think that&#8217;s going to be a big opportunity in 2015. </p><p>Also what people need to look for is the right technology solution for your content marketing program that will allow you to do that &#8212; a solution that has some of this adaptive content infrastructure built into it.</p><p>We&#8217;re starting to hear this term more &#8212; a lot more people are taking about it. I think you will start to see that. </p><p>You see that with podcasting, right? The barriers for entry to podcasting were a lot more difficult because it was expensive. There were technology hurdles.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Take the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com/" target="_blank">Rainmaker Platform</a>, for example. One of the goals of Rainmaker is to help make that technology part of podcasting much easier &#8212; so you can just get in and focus on your content. </p><p>People who are really interested in this want to look for a solution that is going to help you jump over those hurdles, or even remove those hurdles for you, so that you can focus on the content part of it.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Exactly. I was thinking about this &#8212; what we&#8217;re after. </p><p>If you know that when a customer searches for X, they end up on Y, then Z is the adaptive content. And it&#8217;s the incentive. </p><p>For example, we know that on average people go to the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.studiopress.com/get-started" target="_blank">StudioPress one-on-one tutorial</a> page seven times before they buy. </p><p>Adaptive content would track that user, count their visits, and on the fourth visit, adapt content to help them make the decision to buy. </p><p>You think, is there a way we can shorten the sales cycle? Because as I was thinking through this, a lot of this talk about adaptive content has been in the brick-and-mortar sphere, merging offline and online. </p><p>What I&#8217;m having a hard time seeing, part of my challenge, and our challenge for 2015, is to see how this works in the online, SaaS &#8212; software as a service &#8212; market. </p><p>How does that work in this environment? How do you use technology to make that experience very individual and tailored to that particular person? </p><p>We&#8217;ll be talking a lot about this in 2015 &#8212; these questions and challenges that we see and how we can overcome them.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> We will. The purpose of this podcast &#8212; looking ahead to 2015 &#8212; has introduced the term adaptive content and given an overview, but you will start to see us speak about it a lot more, both on <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~copyblogger.com" target="_blank">copyblogger.com</a> and <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com" target="_blank">newrainmaker.com</a>. </p><p>But with that, Demian, we face the reality that this is actually our last show of 2014. We won&#8217;t have the show two Tuesdays from now. </p><p>We&#8217;ll actually have our best of Copyblogger 2014 post up, so that&#8217;s a great place to go and catch up on anything that you may have missed this year. </p><p>Do you have any closing words for the listeners as we close out a successful year?</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Yes. I would say enjoy the holidays, and thank you so much for listening.</p><p>We appreciate every single one of you, and we appreciate your comments and your feedback, and thank you for allowing us to do this.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Yes. I absolutely agree. Thank you, everyone who has listened to, subscribed to, and shared The Lede. </p><p>Really, your support is what makes this show so much fun to produce. We&#8217;re definitely looking forward to bringing you even better content in 2015. </p><p>So stay tuned, because we&#8217;ll have a lot more fun, entertaining, engaging, informative, and hopefully actionable episodes on the way.</p><p>But until then, as you said, Demian, we wish everyone a happy holiday season, and let&#8217;s get ready to make 2015 our best year yet.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Sounds good. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Thank you for listening to this episode of The Lede. </p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, and if you&#8217;ve enjoyed The Lede in 2014, please consider giving the show a rating or a review over on iTunes.</p><p>And don&#8217;t forget, go to <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~authorityrainmaker.com" target="_blank">AuthorityRainmaker.com</a> for all the details about Authority Rainmaker, our live event coming up in May of 2015. </p><p>You can still get the early-bird pricing, so don&#8217;t procrastinate. </p><p>So many people who went to last year&#8217;s event have already registered for this year&#8217;s because they know how fun, educational, and transformational this event can be. </p><p>Come join us.

They do. And most of the Sharks seem like reasonable people. (With Kevin O&#8217;Leary doing his duty as designated villain, obligatory on most reality shows.) </p><p>But the core premise of Shark Tank &#8212; I hate it. I think it&#8217;s wrong, and I think it&#8217;s dangerous, and I think it hurts business owners.</p><p>Here&#8217;s why.</p><p><span id="more-44722"></span>The fundamental premise of Shark Tank is that people who have had big wins in business will automatically know more about <em>your</em> business than you do.</p><p>And underneath that is the part I <em>really</em> hate &#8212; the idea that some of us just have that &#8220;entrepreneurial gene,&#8221; and some don&#8217;t.</p><p>The Sharks have had some significant wins, so they&#8217;re &#8220;smart.&#8221; And as a small business owner? You&#8217;re just some fool who&#8217;s <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/naive/" target="_blank">naive</a> enough to think you can make a go of it on your own.</p><p>And so contestants audition for the right to go begging, hat in hand, to a handful of appointed gurus who might deign to take a large chunk of their business in exchange for a small amount of money. If they&#8217;re very very lucky.</p><p>Feh.</p><h3>Owning a business is something normal people do</h3><p>You don&#8217;t have to have some kind of special gene or supernatural ability to start and run a successful business. </p><p>You don&#8217;t need to be part of some anointed class. You don&#8217;t need rare connections or even some kind of super secret knowledge.</p><p>(And of course, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/david-siteman-garland-interview/" target="_blank">those of us who do business online have some nice advantages</a> in terms of costs, complexity, and scalability &#8212; which makes running a successful business even more doable.)</p><p>The traits you need to be a successful business owner aren&#8217;t the kind you read about in glossy business magazines, or their blogs. </p><p>The biggest trait you need is plenty of is stubbornness, but that can be boosted with the right support and encouragement. And it&#8217;s best when it&#8217;s paired with a solid ability to look realistically at the situation in front of you, and figure out the wisest next steps. (The right support can be useful there as well.)</p><p>I have known incredibly successful entrepreneurs who can barely tie their shoes. (No, not <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/goonies/" target="_blank">the crew I work with now</a>, this group are all pretty awesome.) <img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p><p>But they knew their business. And they knew what it took to be successful. On balance, moments of entrepreneurial delusion notwithstanding, <em>they understood their audience of customers</em> and what that audience needed.</p><p>Once you have that, everything else is just a matter of hanging in there and figuring stuff out.  </p><h3>The delusion filter</h3><p>As always on &#8220;reality&#8221; television, a big part of the entertainment value comes from feeling superior to the deluded contestants. </p><p><em>Entrepreneurial</em> is, after all, something of a synonym for “unemployable.”</p><p>But you don&#8217;t need a Shark Tank to find your blind spots. </p><p>The litmus test between delusion and confidence is your audience. If they’re following, sharing, and connecting with your content, you’re on to something. If they&#8217;re paying attention to you <em>and</em> they actually buy something, that&#8217;s your green light. Move forward with confidence.</p><p>For example, on the show Kevin rolled his eyes at brother and sister founders of Pipcorn for selling their specialty popcorn at $5 a bag, when regular old popcorn is maybe $1.50 a bag. </p><p>Apparently he’s never been inside a Whole Foods. Where Pipcorn was, in fact, already selling plenty of bags of their fancy popcorn. You know, on that aisle in Whole Foods where all the $5 popcorn is.</p><p>The most brilliant investor isn&#8217;t as smart as your audience about what&#8217;s going to make <em>your</em> business work.</p><h3>Protect your confidence</h3><p>I heard a piece of advice last year that blew me away. It comes from business coach Dan Sullivan, and it&#8217;s this: The first duty of every entrepreneur is to <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/protect-your-confidence/" target="_blank">protect your confidence</a>.</p><p>That, I believe, is where that &#8220;mindful stubbornness&#8221; comes from. </p><p>When you&#8217;re in negotiations with someone you shouldn&#8217;t be working with, that person may &#8220;neg&#8221; you &#8212; put you and your company down in order to make themselves seem like someone you need. It&#8217;s a technique used by the creepy &#8220;Pick Up Artist&#8221; community, and it&#8217;s also used by unethical marketers. (&#8220;Buy my product and maybe your friends won&#8217;t hate you so much!&#8221;)</p><p>Investors are not necessarily smarter than you are <em>about your audience and customers</em>. And thinking that they are can destroy a great little business. I&#8217;ve seen it happen first-hand more than once, and it makes me angry when it does.</p><p>Protect your confidence. And if a potential partner &#8220;negs&#8221; you, it&#8217;s an unmistakeable sign that you need to go the other direction. The negativity will corrode your business faster than any cash infusion can build it. Don&#8217;t look back. </p><h3>Partners are amazing &#8212; when they&#8217;re really partners</h3><blockquote><p>Some of them want to use you.<br>Some of them want to be used by you.<br>Some of them want to abuse you.<br>Some of them want to be abused.</p></blockquote><p>In the immortal words of Annie Lennox, everybody&#8217;s looking for something.</p><p>In the Shark Tank universe, the contestant &#8220;wins&#8221; if they get a deal, and &#8220;loses&#8221; if they don&#8217;t.</p><p>But &#8220;failed&#8221; contestant Julie Busha of Slawsa saw through this, and wrote about it on her blog:</p><blockquote><p>They like to invest in businesses where they can give added value (Daymond wants to plug something into his overseas manufacturing pipeline, Lori wants to get an item on QVC, Mark &#038; Robert want tech…and of course, Kevin wants a royalty). ~ <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.slawsa.com/pages/slawsa-on-shark-tank" target="_blank">Slawsa on Shark Tank</a> </p></blockquote><p>By Busha&#8217;s own analysis, if she&#8217;d made a deal, she would have &#8220;won&#8221; the game &#8212; but at a grave cost. She would have given away part of her business to a partner who didn&#8217;t really have anything to add. </p><p>(This is the part where I tip my hat to the integrity of the Sharks for not making a deal where they didn&#8217;t add value &#8212; even though they thought the product was excellent and were complimentary of Busha&#8217;s business skills.)</p><p>If you don’t have what your partner wants, there’s no deal to be made. Don’t obsess. Move on and find a better fit. </p><p>Try not to squander your energy or confidence thinking about a business partner, promotion partner, or customer who “just isn’t that into you.” </p><h3>The way that Shark Tank is amazing for their contestants</h3><p>I said above that Julie Busha didn&#8217;t &#8220;win&#8221; the show, but of course she did.</p><p>She was asking for $150,000, which she didn&#8217;t get. She did, however, get eight minutes on prime-time television on a popular show &#8212; and in the form of content, not advertising, so viewers were actually paying close attention.</p><p>She gave up no equity in her business, but received millions of dollars&#8217; worth of advertising. Or more to the point, <em>content</em>, which, as we know, works <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com/audio/media-not-marketing/" target="_blank">a whole lot better than advertising</a>. </p><p>So as an advertising and promotion vehicle for small business, I guess I don&#8217;t hate Shark Tank after all. In fact, I see an awful lot of the &#8220;failed&#8221; company products on the shelves of my local stores. And I notice them, because they had an eight-minute pitch to show me exactly why they were cool.</p><p>But I still don&#8217;t want you listening to anything Kevin O&#8217;Leary has to say. That guy doesn&#8217;t know beans about your business.</p><p><em>What do you think? <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.linkedin.com/groups/So-what-do-YOU-think-8117878.S.5948462521613635588" target="_blank"><strong>Join the discussion here in our LinkedIn discussion group</a>.</strong> </em></p><div class="author-box"><div><img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7cee49037749ad1b40cfd13ecbf44bda?s=100&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D100&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-100 photo' height='100' width='100' /> <span class="subheading">About the author</span><h3>Sonia Simone</h3><br><p><strong>Sonia Simone</strong> is co-founder and Chief Content Officer of Copyblogger Media.
