				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From author and TPV regular, Julia Rachel Barrett:</p>
<blockquote><p>I know this sounds really self-centered, and I swore I wouldn’t talk about <em>my</em> books over here, but I’m beginning to believe I will remain unappreciated in my lifetime.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>But it ain’t crap, my writing, I mean.</p>
<p>I’ve been re-working a few books… Just fixing scattered bugs. You know, those little flaws that manage to mar the narrative and continue to reproduce themselves despite a thousand readings. I’m re-working my books because, you see, I’m leaving KDP Select and Kindle Unlimited and expanding my work to all outlets.</p>
<p>Why am I doing this, you ask? I’ve been luckier than many Indie writers. I heard the complaints about falling sales, but for a time I hung in there, made more money every month than I had the previous month. But then the other shoe dropped and my royalties, rankings and readership tanked. <strong>New readers are not discovering me as they’ve done for years</strong>. I can’t  ignore reality. Things might could pick up, but I doubt it. And I’m not taking any chances.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>I don’t know what will happen. I do not. I am no more a prognosticator than Professor Marvel from the Wizard of Oz. But I will say this– the Indie world is in a fight for its life. We are, or so it seems to me, moving back toward a model of traditional publishing but this time the<em>Traddies</em> have learned a lesson (from us) and they are gonna pub on the cheap, co-opt us, force us to the thinnest of margins, and, in a very real and very large sense, this will screw every writer, from the tallest to the smallest. Kind of like The Grinch Who Stole Christmas.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>I have no plans to stop writing. In fact, I’m busy writing away. But I swear I feel as if I’m writing for posterity. As in, years from now someone will discover me and he or she will say, “Hey, this is a good book. Who is this author and why have I never heard of her? I’m gonna tell all my friends to read her work.”</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Publishing Perspectives:</p>
<blockquote><p>Around the world the picture changes from country to country with regard to book pricing, with some countries that might appear very free market – such as Japan and South Korea – opting for versions of retail price maintenance (RPM), and others that one might think are more controlled – like Switzerland – operating a free market. Europe is a mass of contradictions, with Norway having RPM, but Sweden not, and Hungary in discussions to bring in the German model.</p>
<p>The situation is fluid too; the information here is based on an International Publishers Association report earlier this year, but it seems that the question of pricing is frequently under review, from country to country. In Poland for example, which currently has no RPM, the Polish Chamber of Books has just drafted a bill that is set to introduce fixed prices for new book releases for 18 months after publication. Mexico, which brought in limited fixed prices in 2008, is concerned over the lack of enforcement.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>“In Germany, the online retailers take advantage of the fact that they can discount English language titles, but not German ones. So for example, the English language editions of Ken Follett are much cheaper than the German edition. As a result, we are seeing worrying signs of bricks and mortar retailers reducing space for English language books because they know it’s difficult to compete with the online giants.”</p>
<p>Former Random House International Director Simon Littlewood notes that in Japan books are prized as a physical object above any other. “Japan has a net book agreement. The role played by books in Japanese culture is very important. Books are printed on lovely paper, they are delicate objects and the public demands that the publishing values are very high. It’s part of Japanese culture – the design, the quality of paper. They wouldn’t produce anything as shoddy as a mass market paperback.”</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Mike Abbott, European Sales Director for Europe at PRH, who lives in France, is a keen observer of his adopted home too. “Books are seen as a cultural rather than a commercial product,” he says. “I think there’s a greater respect for authors and reading than there is in Anglo Saxon countries. The state intervenes in cultural matters – there’s an attitude that this is what the state is there for, to protect and support culture. <em>Liberté</em>, <em>egalité</em>, <em>fraternité </em>– the freedom of choice in where you buy books, an equality of price and a brotherhood of shops if you like. I think there’s a gap between the Anglo-Saxon world and continental Europe – the latter is more unified in its cultural attitudes.”</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Digital Book World:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>This is the fourteenth installment in our “Digital Publishing Questions” blog series, featuring Steven Zacharius, Chairman, President and CEO of Kensington Publishing Corp.</em></p>
<p><strong>What do you think has been the most newsworthy event for authors in the past year around publishing and digital change?</strong></p>
<p>Clearly the Hachette-Amazon negotiation was the biggest and most newsworthy event of the year. In addition to this were the clear battle lines drawn between traditionally published authors and indie authors over the issues it raised. Now we can hopefully go back to trying to sell more books.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p><strong>Will Amazon’s ebook market share grow in 2015, or will this be the year that Apple, Kobo, Google and Nook (or someone else) push them back?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t see Amazon’s market share decreasing. For companies operating on the wholesale model, I think there will still be an increase in business from Kindle Unlimited sales.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From The New Yorker:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="descender">There’s something innately funny about Merriam-Webster’s announcement, earlier this month, that “culture” is their 2014 Word of the Year. “Culture” is the “Scary Movie” of words of the year, which, ordinarily, are supposed to reflect culture (“vape,” “selfie”) without actually being “culture.” Merriam-Webster’s editors are at pains to clarify that they weren’t trying to be meta (which, incidentally, would’ve made a great word of the year back in 2000). The word “culture,” they explain, was simply the word that saw the biggest spike in look-ups on their Web site. Confusion about culture was just part of the culture this year. People were desperate to know what “culture” meant.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that “culture” is a confusing word, this year or any year. Merriam-Webster offers six definitions for it (including the biological one, as in “bacterial culture”). The problem is that “culture” is more than the sum of its definitions. If anything, its value as a word depends on the tension between them. The critic Raymond Williams, in his souped-up dictionary, “Keywords,” writes that “culture” has three divergent meanings: there’s culture as a process of individual enrichment, as when we say that someone is “cultured” (in 1605, Francis Bacon wrote about “the culture and manurance of minds”); culture as a group’s “particular way of life,” as when we talk about French culture, company culture, or multiculturalism; and culture as an activity, pursued by means of the museums, concerts, books, and movies that might be encouraged by a Ministry of Culture (or covered on a blog like this one). These three senses of culture are actually quite different, and, Williams writes, they compete with one another. Each time we use the word “culture,” we incline toward one or another of its aspects: toward the “culture” that’s imbibed through osmosis or the “culture” that’s learned at museums, toward the “culture” that makes you a better a person or the “culture” that just inducts you into a group.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>In the postwar decades, “culture” was associated with the quest for personal growth: even if you rejected “establishment” culture, you could turn to “the counterculture.” In the eighties, nineties, and aughts, it was a source of pride: the multiculturalist ethos had us identitying with our cultures. But today, “culture” has a furtive, shady, ridiculous aspect. Often, when we attach the word “culture” to something, it’s to suggest that it has a pervasive, pernicious influence (as in “celebrity culture”). At other times, “culture” is used in an aspirational way that’s obviously counterfactual: institutions that drone on about their “culture of transparency” or “culture of accountability” often have neither. On all sides, “culture” is used in a trivializing way: there’s no real culture in “coffee culture” (although the coffee at Culture, a coffee shop near my office, is excellent). But, at the same time, it’s hard to imagine applying the word “culture” to even the most bona-fide “cultural institutions.” We don’t say that <small>MOMA</small> fosters “art culture,” because to describe art as a “culture” is, subtly, to denigrate it. In 1954, when the magazine <em>Film Culture </em>was founded, its name made movie lovers sound glamorous. Today, it sounds vaguely condescending.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>That’s not to say, necessarily, that music culture or art culture or book culture has gotten worse—or that our collective way of life has gone downhill. It’s our sense of the <em>word </em>“culture” that has grown darker, sharper, more skeptical. But, if words are tools for thinking, then this year “culture” has been used to think about the parts of our society that function poorly. That may even be a sign, in a way, of an improvement in our culture. If our increasingly analytical, sociological way of thinking about “culture” is helping us to improve the culture, that’s a positive development. Confusion over its evolving meaning is a good reason to look up “culture” in the dictionary, but so is an interest in understanding the world and making it better.</p></blockquote>
