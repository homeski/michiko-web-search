				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For seven years, I worked for a nonprofit, managing teams in various departments and communicating with team members and colleagues. Inevitably, this meant a lot of communication with a lot of different people.</p>
<p><a href="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/CarveTime_1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15864" src="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/CarveTime_1.png" alt="A Simple Way to Carve Out Time in Your Week for What Really Matters" width="660" /></a>I felt like I was being productive, but in fact it was the opposite.</p>
<p>This is one of the biggest challenges facing any growing organization. As you get bigger, you create <a title="Creative Productivity System" href="http://goinswriter.com/creative-productivity-system/" target="_blank">systems</a> and hire people to help you scale for growth. But with each step towards <em>bigger</em>, you increase your distance from the work you set out to do. Or at least, that&#8217;s the temptation.</p>
<p>In my case, I was spending four to six hours a day in my email inbox, on the phone, and in meetings. And I wasn&#8217;t getting any of the real work that needed doing, done. It all felt so overwhelming.</p>
<p>Some days, I just went from one meeting to the next. Others, I&#8217;d send and receive hundreds of emails, ending the day with a false sense of accomplishment, like my worth was tied up in my ability to reply to everyone else&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p>I was busy doing many things but wasn&#8217;t accomplishing the most important things.</p>
<h3>The difference between busy and productive</h3>
<p>The difference between busyness and <a title="How to Jumpstart Your Productivity" href="http://goinswriter.com/jumpstart-productivity/" target="_blank">productivity</a> is this:</p>
<p>Staying busy is what happens when you are caught constantly responding to the most urgent needs around you.</p>
<p>Being productive is the result of actively addressing the most important items on your own to-do list.</p>
<p>The latter takes discipline and a good deal of saying no, but it can mean a lot less stress and anxiety for you and a lot more of the essential stuff getting done.</p>
<p>Most everyone I talk to is busy. We all have more than enough to do on our plates. We can&#8217;t possibly respond to every need that comes our way. So being intentional about how we do respond to the daily demands on our time is essential to doing work we can be proud of.</p>
<p>But this is much easier said than done. The main areas people struggle with this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having too many things to do.</li>
<li>Constantly responding to other people&#8217;s requests.</li>
<li>Talking about doing things instead of doing them.</li>
</ul>
<p>A simple way for you to stop being busy doing so many things and start focusing on the most important things is for you to regain control of your schedule. The fruit of such a decision can be nothing short of life-changing.</p>
<p>When you start making your schedule work for you instead of the other way around, you begin to focus on what matters most. And you leave the rest in the &#8220;someday&#8221; category. It can feel pretty liberating.</p>
<h3>Three daily disciplines to master</h3>
<p>So let&#8217;s go back to my days at the nonprofit and how I regained control of my day-to-day. There were a few things I did, but in a nutshell, I stopped reacting to my day and instead starting attacking it with intention. Here&#8217;s what that looks like:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Decide to do one important thing every day.</strong> Having a daily to-do list of a dozen items that each take at least an hour to accomplish is going to leave you feeling frustrated and overwhelmed. Instead, set one absolutely important task for the day that you have to do. Everything after that is gravy.</li>
<li><strong>Wait an hour before checking email.</strong> Use this first hour of the day to focus on your most important priority. And here&#8217;s the kicker: actually do it. Don&#8217;t procrastinate or wait; just get the deed done. You&#8217;ll be surprised how much momentum you feel throughout your day after doing this. (Pro tip: check email once in the morning and once in the afternoon.)</li>
<li><strong>Batch your meetings.</strong> Even on days when I only had a handful of meetings, I noticed that it was hard to get into a productive groove when every couple hours I had a meeting or phone call. The disruption made it difficult to focus. I was drifting from one thing to the next, being ruled by other people&#8217;s schedules, but wasn&#8217;t getting my own stuff done.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s it. Don&#8217;t react to your day; attack it. Make your schedule work for you, not the other way around. [<a title="Tweet that" href="http://ctt.ec/iztSr" target="_blank">Tweet</a>]</p>
<h3>Still struggling? Start here&#8230;</h3>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to be amazing to get started. I struggle with these things on a daily basis. One of the most embarrassing parts about being a <a title="Full-time writer" href="http://goinswriter.com/full-time/" target="_blank">full-time writer</a> is that I still have to fight for time to write. Every single day.</p>
<p>But if I don&#8217;t schedule it and prioritize it, it doesn&#8217;t get done. And I know I&#8217;m not the only one. So if all this feels overwhelming or like too much to handle, just pick one discipline to start: <strong>Try waiting to check email or schedule anything for that first hour of the day, and then do the same for the last hour of the day. </strong></p>
<p>That alone would give you back an extra 10 hours a week (one hour at the beginning of the day and one at the end, times five). And this is just the beginning of a whole world of possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This idea of <a title="Shave 10 Hours Off Your Week" href="http://michaelhyatt.com/how-to-shave-ten-hours-off-your-work-week.html" target="_blank">shaving 10 hours off your work week</a> was originated by <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/" target="_blank">Michael Hyatt</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/" target="_blank">Michael Hyatt</a>, those are key indicators that we are on the right track.</p>
<p>I recently had the chance to chat with Michael about setting and achieving goals. We talked about his 5-day process for goal setting. And the reasons why some people are able to achieve their goals while others don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>We all start with good intentions. But good intentions don&#8217;t translate to lasting change and we usually give up. Failure doesn&#8217;t happen because our intentions are flawed. Failure happens because the process is flawed.</p>
<p>Michael tells us about the seven major life areas that need goals to help us be well-rounded, successful people. Because the truth is, each area of life impacts the other.</p>
<p>In this episode of <a href="http://goinswriter.com/itunes" target="_blank">The Portfolio Life</a>, Michael shares how happiness is not found in arriving at the destination but in the journey.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We are never more happy than when we are making significant progress toward a goal that matters to us.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I wasted a lot of time talking about writing, even thinking about it, but did very little of it myself. I was a <em>fake</em>. Then I had an epiphany&#8230;</p>
<p>Three years ago, my life, and my writing, started to change. I began calling my own bluff. I stopped talking and started doing. It all came down to a fundamental shift in what I believed about myself. I stopped saying I <em>wanted</em> to write and began calling myself a writer. Then I started acting like it.</p>
<p>The results were staggering. Over the course of eight months, I had:</p>
<ul>
<li>over 100,000 monthly blog readers,</li>
<li>a book contract, and</li>
<li>more attention than I knew what to do with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wondered: <em>What if one day, I could share this process with others?</em></p>
<h3>This took two years to build</h3>
<p>Two years ago, I launched an <a title="Tribe Writers" href="http://tribewriters.com" target="_blank">online course</a> that took me over eight months to build. Since then, we&#8217;ve been tweaking things, making it the best online community writers we could.</p>
<p>Finally, I gave into the requests I was getting via email to teach what I had learned about writing and building an audience.</p>
<p>Initially, we opened registration to a small group of readers. Immediately, I was overwhelmed by the response: over 450 people signed up to be part of the charter group.</p>
<p>Together, students and teacher, we went through the content (a total of 30+ multimedia lessons and over a dozen expert interviews), covering the following material in four modules:</p>
<ol>
<li>How to <strong>hone your writing voice</strong> and find a worldview that resonates with an audience</li>
<li>The importance of <strong>establishing a platform</strong> and building a list</li>
<li>What it takes to <strong>expand your reach</strong> and serve your way into relationship</li>
<li>Why you need to <strong>get published</strong> and share your work with the world</li>
</ol>
<p>As we went along, students gave feedback and critiques on the lessons. When they finished, I spent another month applying what they&#8217;d told me, just because I wanted it to be the best it could be.</p>
<h3>One of the most rewarding things I&#8217;ve done</h3>
<p>We called the finished product <a href="http://tribewriters.com/join/">Tribe Writers:</a> an online membership program to help you find the audience your writing deserves. And it&#8217;s one of the most rewarding things I&#8217;ve done with my platform so far.</p>
<p>Sure, it took the greater part of a year to build and maybe I could&#8217;ve rushed the process, but this is something I&#8217;m proud of.</p>
<p>Despite friends telling me I&#8217;m crazy for charging less than the market rate, I wanted to make something not for the social elite, but for anyone who wanted to improve their craft.</p>
<p><strong>The course opens up for registration a few times per year, and each time we add a new feature. It&#8217;s something that gets better with time. Which means now is the best time to <a title="Join Tribe Writers" href="http://tribewriters.com/join/" target="_blank">join</a>. We won&#8217;t re-open again for six months.</strong></p>
<p>Tribe Writers is more than a one-and-done course. It&#8217;s a dynamic, creative community that will support you in meeting your lifelong writing goals.</p>
<p>It lasts <strong>eight weeks</strong>, consisting of <strong>30+ multimedia lessons</strong> broken into <strong>four modules</strong>, weekly emails, an online <strong>discussion forum</strong>, and other special features (which we&#8217;re always updating and improving).</p>
<h3>Five reasons to join now</h3>
<p>Because I believe in over-delivering, I&#8217;ve included five incentives to sign up for this next class:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LIFETIME MEMBERSHIP</strong> to a community of 2000+ writers</li>
<li><b>ACCESS TO ME </b>through monthly conference calls</li>
<li><strong>BONUS CONTENT</strong>, including expert interviews with <em>NY Times</em> best-selling authors and popular bloggers (in addition to audio, video, and text lessons)</li>
<li><strong>ONLINE SUPPORT</strong> to answer all your questions (plus access to archived conference calls and other teachings from previous classes)</li>
<li><strong>FREE STUFF</strong> worth over $500 (just for signing up)</li>
</ul>
<p>When you <a title="Join Tribe Writers" href="http://tribewriters.com/join/" target="_blank">join Tribe Writers</a>, you&#8217;ll immediately get the chance to join a group of writers who are all going through the same struggles you&#8217;re experiencing and who want to help you win with your words.</p>
<p>Through the process, you will get coaching and encouragement, maybe even some lifelong friends.</p>
<h3>What the students say</h3>
<p>I asked some of students to share what they got out of the course, and here&#8217;s what they said:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Jeff has provided invaluable material at a frightfully low price. The contributions and links the rest of you have made have taught me a lot as well. I may have a master&#8217;s degree in writing, but now I feel I have the tools necessary to reach my readers.<br />
</em><strong>—Eric von Mizener</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>Starting from nothing — no drafts, no writings, no concepts — I have in the short span of eight weeks created a self-hosted blog with content, learned how to write for an authentic audience and found the deeper meaning of what it means to be a writer.<br />
</em><strong>—Jennifer Humble</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>Before this course, I was afraid to publish an ebook and take the steps required to grow my blog. Now I&#8217;ve finished an e-book/manifesto and have tripled the size of my blog subscriber list.<br />
</em><strong>—James Prescott</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>Before this course I wrote 100 words a day. Now, I write 1,000 to 2,000 a day.<br />
</em><strong>—Devan Crable</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>Tribe Writers reignited my passion for writing and blogging! Even if you already know what you are doing (or think you do) this course will take to the next level and a few levels above that one!</em><br />
<strong>—Bryan Hutchinson</strong></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s be honest for a moment. At times, we all want what other people have. We long for the fame and fortune we seem to be missing out on. We are <em>envious</em>. This envy often leads to guilt and shame. But is it always such a bad thing?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/PL_Header_Ep-035_1.png" width="660" alt="" /></p>
<p>It’s easy to see someone else’s success and compare yourself to what you <em>think</em> you see. Their finished product looks great, they <em>must</em> have it together. &#8220;Why don’t I feel <em>that</em> confident or competent?&#8221;<em> </em>you wonder.<em> </em></p>
<p>Or maybe you see someone doing the same thing you&#8217;re doing but experiencing far greater success. Why <em>is</em> that? What makes their work better than yours? On the surface, this kind of comparison feels detrimental. But perhaps, there&#8217;s a way redeem this &#8220;trap&#8221; and use it for good.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the truth:</p>
<p><strong>Envy isn’t always bad. Complacency is. Envy is an indication of something you want, but don’t yet have.</strong> [<a title="tweet" href="http://ctt.ec/tk3Yv" target="_blank">Tweet that</a>]</p>
<p>The hidden benefit of comparison is that you can use it to push forward. In this episode of <a href="http://goinswriter.com/itunes" target="_blank">The Portfolio Life</a>, my co-host Andy Traub and I talk about how we both have struggled with comparison, what we’ve done about it, and how you can turn your comparison into motivation.</p>

<p>Join us as we explore this tension between envy and motivation and why the two can go hand in hand. Admiring someone else&#8217;s success gives you something to strive for. In other words, envy, with the right motivation, can help you succeed.</p>
<p>Many of us feel like we&#8217;re competing with our friends or peers. But wanting to be better than everyone else is an empty pursuit. The real question is do we want to be better than we were yesterday?</p>

<ul>
<li>Some questions you can ask yourself when you’re feeling jealous (so you don&#8217;t get stuck in that &#8220;What about me?&#8221; trap)</li>
<li>The difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset and why understanding this will change everything for you</li>
<li>How to use your envy to become a more <a title="How I Get Things Done" href="http://goinswriter.com/get-things-done/" target="_blank">productive</a> person</li>

<p>“What’s in it for me?”</p>
<p>This is what every audience member and prospective customer is thinking, whether it’s consciously or not. And the best thing you can do to make a difference with your art, to share a message that connects, is to answer that question before they ask it. In other words, make your work so valuable that sharing it is a no-brainer. </p>
<p>Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offering an eBook that you could charge for and instead give it away to anyone who signs up for your email newsletter.</li>
<li>Spend an entire year (as I did) being as generous as you possibly can be to whatever readers you have, without asking for a thing.</li>
<li>Offer the first 15 minutes of a coaching or counseling session for free so that potential clients can see the clear value you offer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instead of making it about you, make it about them.</strong></p>
<p>A funny thing tends to happen when we take this generous approach with our creations: When you make it about them, they’ll make it about you.</p>
<p>You know this already, of course. You just need to apply it. You’ve heard that people won’t care about you until you’ve shown them how much you care. The same is true here. We have to discipline ourselves to not be selfish, to open up our hands and not be stingy with the world.</p>
<p>I think you just might be surprised at the response you get.</p>
<div class="special">To see exactly what I mean, watch this video (and don’t miss the other two in this free series I’m doing): <a href="https://my.leadpages.net/leadbox/140c6c573f72a2%3A1245e56aeb46dc/5709588863123456/" target="_blank">Check it out.</a><script src="//my.leadpages.net/leadbox-810.js" type="text/javascript" data-leadbox="140c6c573f72a2:1245e56aeb46dc" data-url="https://my.leadpages.net/leadbox/140c6c573f72a2%3A1245e56aeb46dc/5709588863123456/" data-config="%7B%7D"></script></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my near-decade of coaching writers, there has been one question I&#8217;ve been asked over and over again. In fact, this is something I often ask myself: <em>What should I write about?</em> The problem is that’s the wrong question.</p>
<div id="attachment_15695" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-15695" src="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/worry-write-about-630x422.jpg" alt="Worried face pic" width="630" height="422" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/9031691@N08/2758739495/">Lisa Brewster</a> via <a href="http://compfight.com">Compfight</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>
<p>When you get stuck thinking about what you should write about, your focus is on the wrong place. You begin to fixate on things like subject and genre, even niche. And all these are not essential to developing your calling as a writer.</p>
<p><strong>The words you say are the paint on the house. The foundation is the belief behind them. Which is something most writers miss.</strong></p>
<p>Where we must begin, if we want people to take us seriously, is not with what we say, but <em>how</em> we say it. As I’ve said before, people care more about the why than the what. In other words:</p>
<p>Voice trumps subject.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s not to say that you shouldn’t have a subject for your blog or book. You should. It just means that’s not enough. Good writers, the ones we remember after they’re gone, are the ones who have <a href="http://goinswriter.com/writing-topics/">developed a worldview</a> and articulate it in a definitive voice.</p>
<p>And you should do the same.</p>
<h3>Getting practical</h3>
<p>So how do we do this? You can tackle this by asking yourself three important questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What’s wrong with the world?</strong> Your answer to this in some way reveals your worldview, your particular perspective that makes you special. List out some possible ideas for this as clues to what makes your <a href="http://goinswriter.com/writing-voice/">voice</a> so unique.</li>
<li><strong>What’s one experience I have had that’s unique to me?</strong> Everyone has a story, and the easiest way to find your voice is to start telling yours. People connect to other people’s experiences, especially when it’s painful or embarrassing. When you share yours, you’re inviting others into a place where they can feel heard. Write one true, vulnerable story, and see how people connect.</li>
<li><strong>What’s something that’s easy to me that’s hard to other people?</strong> You are more of an expert than you realize. Right now, someone is looking to you for your expertise on something. A great way to figure that out is to reach out to a handful of friends and ask them what you’re an expert at. See what they say, and don&#8217;t discount how easy it is to you. This, too, is a clue to what you should be writing.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the secret to how you never run out of an idea on what to write. And this, after years of frustration, is what I finally decided to do. Don’t chase trends. Write with a worldview. And trust that the topics will follow. It works. (Click the image below to learn more.)</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I waited seven years to do this. I read dozens of books and wasted hours upon hours every week meeting with people, trying to learn this simple secret. It was the answer to the question my heart was asking. Maybe you’re asking it, too.</p>
<div id="attachment_15653" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="Professional Writer"><img class="size-large wp-image-15653" src="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/become-writer-630x351.png" alt="Professional Writer" width="630" height="351" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://my.leadpages.net/leadbox/14205d473f72a2%3A1245e56aeb46dc/5762957321437184/" target="_blank">Click here</a><script src="//my.leadpages.net/leadbox-808.js" type="text/javascript" data-leadbox="14205d473f72a2:1245e56aeb46dc" data-url="https://my.leadpages.net/leadbox/14205d473f72a2%3A1245e56aeb46dc/5762957321437184/" data-config="%7B%7D"></script>to watch my free video series.</p></div>
<p><em>Do I have what it takes?</em></p>
<p>Every writer struggles with this. In fact, every person grapples with it on some level. It’s not just a creative struggle, but a human one. We all are wondering if what we are made of is enough. Can we really survive this trauma, this struggle, this current trial – whatever it may be?</p>
<p>The answer, though, is not something you can find out there, in the world. It’s something you must grapple with from within. It’s a question only you can answer. And for the longest time, I misunderstood this.</p>
<h3>My awakening</h3>
<p>When I was starting out a few years ago as a blogger, I had a few conversations that changed my life. Even though this question your heart is asking is one you know the answer to, you will find guides along the way. These were mine.</p>
<p><strong>CONVERSATION #1:</strong> In an interview, Steven Pressfield told me that a writer becomes a writer “when he says he is.” It doesn’t matter what other people think. It matters what <em>you</em> think, what you believe about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>CONVERSATION #2:</strong> A few months later, I was having a conversation with my friend Paul and he asked me what my dream was. I told him I didn’t have any, and he looked surprised.</p>
<p>“Really? Because I would’ve thought your dream was to be a writer.”</p>
<p>“Well,” I said. “Yeah, I guess I’d like to be a writer… some day.”</p>
<p>“Jeff,” he said. “You don’t have to want to be a writer. You are a writer. You just need to write.”</p>
<p>That was all it took for me to get started. And what happened next was nothing short of extraordinary:</p>
<ul>
<li>I <strong>launched a blog</strong> which had over 50,000 monthly readers by the end of the first year.</li>
<li>The next year, I <strong>replaced my wife’s income</strong>, and a few months later replaced my own.</li>
<li>A few months after that, I <strong>quit my job</strong> and became a <a href="http://goinswriter.com/turn-pro/">professional writer</a> and never looked back.</li>
</ul>
<p>It sounds like it happened so fast, but really the process took about nine years – seven years of waiting and two years of finally doing the work. But all of this knowledge is worthless without understanding one simple principle.</p>

<h3>The Activity-Identity Principle</h3>
<p>I don’t know why, but when I started calling myself a writer, everything changed.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because now that I was owning my identity, I felt pressured to live into it. Or maybe we are all waiting to become who we really are. Regardless, I now believe in a very simple but powerful principle:</p>
<p><strong>Activity always follows identity. </strong></p>
<p>This, I think, is the reason behind most people’s struggles. And it’s the secret to breakthrough in your career, your goals, and your life. Before you can do something, you have to become someone.</p>
<p>But where, exactly, do you begin?</p>
<p>Start with your words, with the everyday things you say (or think) about yourself. In the words of Mr. Pressfield, “You are when you say you are.” And that, as simple, as it sounds, just might be the answer.</p>
<h3>Here’s your challenge (and a free video series)</h3>
<p>If you’ve read my blog for some time, you’re probably not unfamiliar with this story or even this idea of owning your identity. Because of the impact it’s had on my life, I’ve written about it many times.</p>
<p>But just because you’ve heard this doesn’t mean you’ve applied it, right? Often, it’s the most familiar things that we take for granted the most.</p>
<p>So if you’re reading this and feeling a little uncomfortable, maybe that’s a prompting. Maybe it’s time for you to take a significant step towards changing your life. Maybe it’s time to become yourself.</p>
<p>Here’s what I want you to do. Try this out. If you were like me, wondering when you would have permission to start writing, why not do what I did, what my friend made me do?</p>
<p><strong>Call yourself a writer.</strong> And watch your confidence grow. Slowly, you will begin to believe more in yourself, and your competence will increase. It&#8217;s a mysterious but beautiful process. As you declare these things to be true, you are becoming more that person.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in, go watch the <a href="https://my.leadpages.net/leadbox/14205d473f72a2%3A1245e56aeb46dc/5762957321437184/" target="_blank">first video in my three-part series</a> on the questions every writer must ask. <a href="https://my.leadpages.net/leadbox/14205d473f72a2%3A1245e56aeb46dc/5762957321437184/" target="_blank">Click here to leave a comment, declaring you&#8217;re a writer</a><script src="//my.leadpages.net/leadbox-808.js" type="text/javascript" data-leadbox="14205d473f72a2:1245e56aeb46dc" data-url="https://my.leadpages.net/leadbox/14205d473f72a2%3A1245e56aeb46dc/5762957321437184/" data-config="%7B%7D"></script>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How can we make a difference in someone&#8217;s life? Really, it doesn&#8217;t take much. Just a few small gestures can make a big difference.</p>
<p><a href="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/PL_Header_Ep-033_1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15613" src="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/PL_Header_Ep-033_1-630x349.png" alt="033: Is That It? How to Create Experiences, Not Just Exchanges [Podcast]" width="630" height="349" /></a></p>
<p>In this episode of <a href="http://goinswriter.com/itunes" target="_blank">The Portfolio Life</a>, my co-host <a href="http://www.takepermission.com/" target="_blank">Andy Traub</a> and I talk about creating wow experiences for people and what it really takes to exceed expectations.</p>
<p>The idea of this show is this:<strong> </strong>Go beyond what is expected, do a little bit more than status quo, to make a difference in someone&#8217;s life.<strong> </strong>Being generous isn&#8217;t always about grand gestures. Doing small things on a consistent basis is all it takes to blow people away.</p>
<p>As you listen to this week&#8217;s episode of the podcast, I hope you are encouraged to make a difference in someone&#8217;s life.</p>

In this episode of The Portfolio Life (http://goinswriter.com/itunes), my co-host Andy Traub (http://www.takepermission.com/) and I talk about creating wow experiences for people and what it really takes to exceed expectations.

The idea of this show is this: Go beyond what is expected, do a little bit more than status quo, to make a difference in someone's life. Being generous isn't always about grand gestures. Doing small things on a consistent basis is all it takes to blow people away.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was the one thing everyone seemed to say. The crucial piece of advice that I was hesitant to take. And as great as it was, it just wasn’t enough.</p>
<div id="attachment_15498" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-15498" src="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/best-blog-advice-630x421.jpg" alt="Best blog advice" width="630" height="421" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/25533361@N00/280882501/">gatogrunge</a> via <a href="http://compfight.com">Compfight</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>
<p>“Just get started.”</p>
<p>This was what all my friends with successsful blogs had told me. It was the holy grail of advice. If I could just begin, they reasoned, then I would find my way.</p>
<p>The problem was I had already done that eight times before. And it just didn’t work.</p>
<h3>Why starting isn’t enough</h3>
<p>There’s something to be said about starting. It’s the place where we all begin. And I’m definitely a fan of not waiting for perfection and just getting on with the work you know you need to do.</p>
<p>But is that enough to succeed? Not quite.</p>
<p>After seven years of trying and failing and then two years of finally figuring it out, I’ve realized that starting is just, well, the start.</p>
<p>If you’re going to share your message with the world, if you’re going to build a blog that matters, you’re going to have to get intentional.</p>
<h3>Three keys to blogging success</h3>
<p>Recently, I released three free video trainings on what I’ve learned from building an online audience of 100,000 people. This was a process that took less than two years, and since then, I’ve taught over 2000 people to do the same.</p>
<p>And now I’m sharing these secrets with you.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve learned (click the links below to watch the videos which are all now available for a limited time):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://goinswriter.com/intentional-blog-video1">Find your voice</a>.</strong> This is the one thing that only you can provide, your unique perspective and way of viewing the world. Learning how to share it is an essential skill.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://goinswriter.com/intentional-blog-video2">Combine passion with need</a>.</strong> It’s not enough to have a dream. You need demand. People must want what you have to offer and actually value it. Otherwise, you only have a hobby.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://goinswriter.com/intentional-blog-video3">Help people</a>.</strong> Some say it’s not who you know but who knows you. But I think it goes deeper than that: it’s not who you know, it’s who you help. Being resourceful is the absolute best way to build an audience.</li>
</ol>
<h3>An opportunity to go deeper</h3>
<p>If you’d like to learn more about this and have a chance to work directly with me, I want to encourage you to check out my new course, <a href="http://intentionalblog.com">Intentional Blog</a>.</p>
<p>This is an A-to-Z course on all things you need to know to start and build a powerful blog. With over 30 step-by-step video tutorials, I share everything I’ve learned in the past decade of training bloggers to succeed and doing it myself.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever thought about starting a blog or have struggled with building an online audience and wondered what the secret was, this <a href="http://intentionalblog.com" title="Intentional Blog" target="_blank">course</a> is for you.</p>
<p>The course will only be available at a 50% discount for first-time students until <strong>11:59 p.m. CT on Wednesday, Nov. 26</strong>. After that, registration will close and the price will go up. I’m also offering exclusive group coaching calls with this first class. </p>
<p>So you won&#8217;t want to miss it. I&#8217;d love to work with you. You can find out more by clicking below.</p>
