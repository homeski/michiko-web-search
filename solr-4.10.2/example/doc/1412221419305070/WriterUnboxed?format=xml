We saw the eighth straight year of being nominated by <em>Writer&#8217;s Digest</em> as a top website, we dabbled in our own publishing imprint <em>Writer Unboxed Publishing</em> with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00LQMDPWG/writunbo-20">Ani Bolton&#8217;s STEEL AND SONG</a>, and also launched our first ever Un-Conference. The industry brought some major news as well&#8211; ebook subscriptions, the plateau of ereader (and ebook) sales, and the great debate between corporate giants Amazon and Hachette. On that note, December has been a fairly quiet month as the industry churns out their &#8220;best of&#8221; lists. Still, you can count on us to find some juicy news to report. Take a look at this month&#8217;s hot links.</p>

She put her degrees to good use teaching high school French for nearly a decade before turning to full time writing and freelance editing. Her debut historical, <a href="http://www.heatherwebb.net/blog/books/">BECOMING JOSEPHINE</a>, will release as lead title in January 2014 from Plume/Penguin.

As an editor, Heather spends oodles of time helping writers find their voice and hone their skills--something she adores. She may often be found twittering helpful links, sharing writing advice and author interviews on her blog Between the Sheets, or teaching novel writing and publishing classes at a local college in her community. Another favorite haunt is the popular, award-winning site <a href="http://RomanceUniversity.org">RomanceUniversity.org</a> where she contributes to the Editor's Posts.

When not writing, Heather flexes her foodie skills and chases her young children. You may even catch her gobbling the odd bonbon.</p><div class="wp-biographia-links"><small><a href="http://www.heatherwebb.net/blog/" target="_blank" title="Heather Webb On The Web" class="wp-biographia-link-">Web</a> | <a href="http://writerunboxed.com/author/heather-webb/" target="_blank" title="More Posts By Heather Webb" class="wp-biographia-link-">More Posts</a></small></div></div><!-- WP Biographia v3.3.2 -->

<p>Remember?  Those were the days when self-publishing had a very bad rap.</p>
<p>Not so much because the books’ quality was shaky (though that tended to be true), nor even because authors had to pay to have them published (though that was indeed frowned upon), but mainly because of the way the firms offering self-publishing services operated.</p>
<p>These firms cut a very nice profit offering everything from proofing to interior and cover design and could earn even more by proposing pricey add-ons, like copy-editing and developmental editing.  Some would even encourage authors to buy into these add-ons by telling them their books had qualified to be nominated for an award but would only be eligible to win if they purchased these extra services.  This was &#8212; and still is &#8212; considered particularly slimy and underhanded. All the more so since many authors, vulnerable in their eagerness for recognition after years of rejection, readily opted in.</p>
<p>Now that self-publishing has been officially de-stigmatized and it’s becoming increasingly acceptable for authors to pay for their books’ production, cottage industries are cropping up around the needs this has created: editing, page and cover design, eReader formatting, distribution to brick-and-mortar shops, marketing, promotion and more.</p>
<p>On one hand, this opens up a whole new world of freedom and opportunity for both authors and publishing-world entrepreneurs. On the other hand, it has given way to a shady side worthy of old stigmas that all authors should be aware of.</p>
<p>On this shady side, service providers don’t just <i>offer</i> add-ons, but either require them or make it very difficult for authors to turn them down.  For example, a <span id="more-34775"></span>publishing provider who requires authors to sign up and pay for a developmental editor before submitting or re-submitting work.  Or who recommends adamantly that authors hire an independent publicist to promote their books.</p>
<p>This becomes especially dubious when the firm or person offering said add-ons urges &#8212; or even requires &#8212; authors to choose specific providers:  The copy-editor who pushes her clients toward a particular interior designer, claiming to know for a fact that “he’s the best person for the job” or insisting that working with that designer will help her to do her own job more effectively.  The distributor who urges first-time authors to hire his preferred PR firm, insisting that said firm “has a lot of experience with debuts” (a phrase that has no real meaning) so is uniquely suited to the job.</p>
<p>This is where I send out my own plea to authors: BEWARE!  While entrepreneurship and initiatives to grow new businesses are healthy and referrals can be a huge help to those who receive them, there’s a big difference between making referrals, and exerting pressure.  When any level of pressure, urging or even strong, persistent encouragement is involved, you must absolutely think twice.</p>
<p>There are and always will be business people whose singular focus on profit does not take authors’ best interest into account.  If you are being strongly urged by somebody to pick a specific provider, there could be any number of ulterior motives at play.</p>
<p>Most often &#8212; I’m sorry to report &#8212; is the nefarious practice of kickbacks.  I’ve seen it time and again: a copy-editor, for example, has a “preferred provider” deal with, say, a website designer in which she receives a kickback in the form of a percentage of any income her referrals lead to.</p>
<p>Business partnerships are another possible motive.  Some firms may actually be owned by, or operate in conjunction with, other firms in a different but related field.  They share resources and although they have different fundamental missions, they offer one another support on the path toward growth and share the profits.  So they have a vested interest making sure clients on one side of the partnership are cross-sold services on the other side, too.</p>
<p>Not that profit is at all a dirty word.  It makes the economy go round and keeps all of us employed, fed and clothed.  I have tremendous respect for business leaders, large and small.  And referrals and preferred relationships are a normal part of the business environment.</p>
<p>The problem arises when the pressure is hard to resist and leads authors &#8212; who are particularly susceptible due to the hopes, dreams and emotions at stake &#8212; to make choices that may not necessarily the best fit for them personally or may not really be a worthy investment.  Then pay for them out of their pockets!</p>
<p>Which smacks a bit of the frowned-upon vanity publishing world.</p>

<p>I heard you&#8217;re taking some time off to celebrate Christmas / Hanukkah / Kwanza / Winter Solstice / Festivus. You might think it&#8217;s time to recharge those batteries and take three naps in front of the <em>A Christmas Story</em> marathon.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote"><p>Go writer-caroling. Head door-to-door, full of Christmas cheer, reading your work to people. Ask for their input.</p>
</div>
<p>But Santa knows you&#8217;ve been complaining for months that you&#8217;d finally finish writing your book if you ever got some free time. Well here it is, buddy, a great big box of time, gift wrapped in the December and January pages of your calendar. Whatever your plans for vacation were&#8211;a simple cup of egg nog by the fire; or racing down hills on a flimsy plastic sled with your laughing children; mayhap a New Year&#8217;s kiss with a new love&#8211;none of them compare with the edification of sitting alone at your keyboard, grinding out a short story you&#8217;ll one day sell to a small journal for ten bucks and a contributor&#8217;s copy. Today your <em>real</em> work begins.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set goals.</strong> The first day of your vacation, write down three things you want to accomplish before heading back to school or work or wherever. Aim high. Write a short story every day! Query twenty agents! Hey, <a href="http://writerunboxed.com/2014/11/15/thirty-days-of-solitude-your-nanowrimo-road-map/">you wrote an entire novel in November</a>; you’re now ready to write one in two weeks. Shoot for the moon! If you miss, you’ll land among the stars in the cold, infinite void of space.</li>
<li><strong>Resist the urge to sleep in.</strong> Instead, wake up at your usual time, as if you were going to work—because you <em>are</em> going to work. And just like you do at the office, you’ll knock out a few pages in between surreptitiously checking Twitter and Facebook.</li>
<li>Who are we kidding, we both know you’re not going to do that.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-34766"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div id="attachment_34768" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/15609463@N03/11559325536/sizes/m/"><img class="wp-image-34768 size-medium" src="http://writerunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/advent_calendar-300x199.jpg" alt="photo by Jamie McCaffrey" width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo by Jamie McCaffrey</p></div>
<p><strong>Schedule a specific writing time</strong> during the day when you’ll be free of other distractions. Tell your roommates, spouses, children, mistresses, the mailman. Consider this time sacred. The fact that you scheduled it at the same time as your parents&#8217; Hanukkah dinner party is purely coincidental.</li>
<li><strong>Do writing prompts.</strong> For example, write a piece of flash fiction based on your kids’ Christmas list. Fun, right? Delight them by letting them read it. Take the kids to the mall to sit on Santa’s lap. Ask them to read the story to Santa. See if he thinks the prose has enough zip.</li>
</ul>
<div class="simplePullQuote"><p>Write about your friend&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Eve party and all the fun you&#8217;d be having if your invitation hadn&#8217;t apparently gotten lost in the mail.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>If you haven’t already, <strong>drop some hints</strong> that you want a little Moleskine notebook so you can jot down your ideas at any time. Oh, you got socks instead? No, no, those are just fine. Very practical. Of course, the notebook would’ve been practical, too, and useful every day. But these socks that’ll get worn once every two weeks before developing a hole are really just as good. Thanks so much.</li>
<li><strong>Go writer-caroling.</strong> Head door-to-door, full of Christmas cheer, reading your work to people. Ask for their input. They may misinterpret some of your ideas. Point out what they got wrong in a jolly voice.</li>
<li><strong>Stay up late. </strong>Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, except you, clacking away at your keyboard while all those other chumps are nestled all snug in their beds, unproductive. You really kinda feel sorry for them as you sip your lukewarm coffee, struggling to stay awake.</li>
<li><strong>Happy New Year! </strong>As an exercise, write about your friend&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Eve party and all the fun you&#8217;d be having if your invitation hadn&#8217;t apparently gotten lost in the mail.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it’s time to head back to work or school or your normal routine, expect to feel a sense of wistful melancholy that you didn’t accomplish everything you wanted to, and that you’re more wrung out than at the beginning of the holiday season. There’s always more you could have done; harness this sense of perpetual dissatisfaction to spur your career. As Dr. Seuss said, “Don&#8217;t cry because it&#8217;s over, smile because it happened.” If you follow my advice during your vacation, you’ll be able to cry for both reasons. Happy holidays!</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>&#8216;What This Loss of a Language Means&#8217;</h3>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t <em>even</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>You know the phrase, right? Another day, another pop-media whine. &#8220;I can&#8217;t even&#8221; is credited to the bloggrs of Tumblr, who apparently can&#8217;t even find it in their hearts to give us an &#8220;e&#8221; before an &#8220;r.&#8221;</p>
<p>Call me Portr. I am so hip that I can&#8217;t even.</p>
<p>While basking in my coolnees, let&#8217;s face it. &#8220;I can&#8217;t even&#8221; is easily as insignificant and fully as irritating as &#8220;what <em>what?&#8221; </em>These streaks of silliness course through the slang-o-rama of our oh-so-social media with slimy charm. You see so many of us slinging them with the hashtags.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of spending almost an hour this week with Paola Prestini. One of the most gifted and accomplished of our composers working today. Prestini writes the kind of &#8220;contemporary classical&#8221; music that holds so much power for authors, a blend of emotional aesthetic and intellectual rigor that&#8217;s akin to what happens in the best fiction. <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/porter-anderson/2014/12/music-for-writers-the-tidal-grace-in-paola-prestinis-oceanic-verses/" target="_blank">My story on her and her newly recorded <em>Oceanic Verses</em></a> is this week&#8217;s entry in my <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/tag/musicforwriters/" target="_blank">#MusicForWriters</a> series at Thought Catalog, with the help of New York  Public Radio&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wqxr.org/story/paola-prestinis-maps-engaging-internal-geography-oceanic-verses/" target="_blank">Q2 Music</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_10038" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://porteranderson.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/paola-prestini-296x300-per-VIA.jpg"><img class="wp-image-10038" src="http://porteranderson.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/paola-prestini-296x300-per-VIA.jpg" alt="Paola Prestini - Image: VisionIntoArt" width="250" height="253" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Paola Prestini &#8211; Image: VisionIntoArt</p></div>
<p>And as I was telling editor Carla Douglas <em>en tweeterie</em>, one of the things I like best about Prestini is that she&#8217;s a supremely conscious composer. While she&#8217;s obviously in touch with her work&#8217;s emotional currents (which run about as deep as the Mediterranean setting of her <a href="http://visionintoart.com/works/oceanic-verses/" target="_blank"><em>Oceanic Verses</em></a>), she&#8217;s also aware of her collaborators, her craft, her career.</p>
<p>Not for nothing did she form a company 15 years ago, while still in school at Juilliard, and that company today serves as the production body supporting her and other artists&#8217; mixed-media work. This translates to platforming in our world of writing. Prestini is an adept platformer. That&#8217;s how you get to Carnegie Hall.</p>
<p>Actually, in <em>Oceanic Verses&#8217;</em> case, that&#8217;s how you get to the Kennedy Center in Washington, to the River to River Festival in New York City, and to London&#8217;s Barbican Centre. Her company is <a href="http://visionintoart.com/" target="_blank">VisionIntoArt</a>, often co-producing with <a href="http://www.bethmorrisonprojects.org/" target="_blank">Beth Morrison Projects</a>. VistionIntoArt&#8217;s new VIA Records label also has produced her husband <a href="http://visionintoart.com/works/somethingoflife/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Zeigler&#8217;s solo debut album</a>. Zeigler is a cellist, formerly with the Kronos Quartet.</p>
<p>In conversation, one of the things that Prestini and I talked about is her alarm at what she calls &#8220;fading civilizations&#8221; &#8212; cultures that are being quickly eroded, ironically by the homogenizing connectivity of digital. She was in residence in Lecce in 2007, in Salento at the remote heel of Italy&#8217;s boot in the Mediterranean, &#8220;a cross-cultural land full of artistic hybrids.&#8221; The experience prompted her to start putting together what she calls her own &#8220;musical language.&#8221;</p>
<p>She has set parts of <em>Oceanic Verses</em> in disappearing dialects. She tells me:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the main themes of the piece is found in a section sung in Griko. [That&#8217;s the Italiot Greek dialect spoken in southeastern Italy.] There are only about 400 people left who speak it. And that led me to a deep look what this loss of a language means. And also how this land could be used as a metaphor for fading civilizations globally.</p></blockquote>
<p>While an artist like Prestini gives us music that can inform and illuminate our own work as writers &#8212; that&#8217;s the point of the #MusicForWriters columns &#8212; I wonder if she doesn&#8217;t also have a quiet message for us as artists of language.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also spoken at length this week with another composer, <a href="http://www.christophercerrone.com/" target="_blank">Christopher Cerrone</a>, whose <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/porter-anderson/2014/12/music-for-writers-christopher-cerrones-cities-of-urban-mythology/" target="_blank"><em>Invisible Cities</em> was the subject of last week&#8217;s #MusicForWriters</a>. In talking with him for an interview story to come, I found out that he goes through as many as 50 manuscripts, searching for the right literature to set to music. He&#8217;s fascinated by how economically something must be said (or sung) in music-theater because the medium moves more slowly than standard speech. He says he thinks that as a child, he understood great books before he knew great music.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it interesting how intensely these sophisticated creators of sonic worlds on stages and in studios are valuing our medium &#8212; these words of ours?</p>
<p><span id="more-34755"></span></p>
<p>Italian, itself &#8212; a patchwork of dialects and patois on the peninsula &#8212; is a relatively small language in the world, and likely to get smaller, although my own experience, from living in Rome, suggests that its population is more resistant to English than some. Denmark has a population of fewer than six million, and many of their younger people seem to like speaking English better than using their own language.</p>
<p>When does the contemporary <em>lingua franca</em> &#8212; which originally was Italian blended with other languages spoken in the Mediterranean ports &#8211;become <em>OMG</em> and <em>meh</em> and <em>yada yada yada</em>?</p>
<h3>Are We Responsible For Our Language?</h3>
<p>Determined, as ever, to make myself unpopular, I&#8217;ll tell you that when editing, I see copy from writers and from other people in publishing that shows me something more than typos (of which I am the patron saint). What I see is ignorance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you noticed how many writers today don&#8217;t seem to know they shouldn&#8217;t ask someone to &#8220;bare with me&#8221; unless they&#8217;re pretty damned intimate with him or her? (And even then, you&#8217;ve just nakedly used an adjective as a verb. Put on a towel.)</li>
<li>Why do I see writers talking of someone who is &#8220;renown&#8221; &#8212; instead of the correct <em>renowned</em>? If you are <em>renowned</em>, you have <em>renown</em>. And if you don&#8217;t get this, how responsible a writer are you?</li>
<li>What makes the vernacular appropriate for a professional writer&#8217;s communications? Could you care less? Really? If you, in fact, couldn&#8217;t care less, then what are you doing working in a field that is wholly dependent on language, its usage, and its common standards of comprehension?</li>
</ul>
<div class="simplePullQuote"><p>What&#8217;s good about &#8220;democratization,&#8221; digital or otherwise, if we impoverish the medium of our work with it?</p>
</div>
<p>Each of these alone is a tiny example of the daily gaffes we all see. In and of itself, a single instance is nothing. Over time, however, and in the minds of millions, uncaring use of language &#8212; and you see it &#8220;alot,&#8221; I mean right? &#8212; starts to add up to a shallowing-out of our own cultural voice.</p>
<p>Yes, I know language is a living thing, meant to adapt and be adapted over time. That&#8217;s fine. I mean, like, yeah, no, I have no need to say &#8220;verily,&#8221; do you?</p>
<p>But there was a gratifying uproar earlier this year when the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0917360583/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0917360583&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=porterandcom-20&amp;linkId=2HD3INWRF7QDUVZP" target="_blank"><em>Associated Press (AP) Stylebook</em></a>, the guide used by journalists, decided that &#8220;more than&#8221; and &#8220;over&#8221; are interchangeable. Kelly McBride at Poynter got a bit of a backlash, herself, when <a href="http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/244314/ap-stylebook-update-a-sign-of-our-times/" target="_blank">she covered it</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;More than&#8221; should refer to numbers: the population of Italy comprises more than 60 million people.</li>
<li>&#8220;Over&#8221; should refer to physical relationships: cows jump over the moon. Don&#8217;t they? Not even in Italy?</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you catch &#8220;comprise&#8221; there?</p>
<ul>
<li>As I write this, my column is <em>composed of</em> several hundred words.</li>
<li>It <em>comprises</em> several hundred words. It is not &#8220;comprised of&#8221; those words.</li>
<li><em>Comprise</em> and <em>compose</em> are not the same word.</li>
</ul>
<p>But with just these little examples, I may have to lie low &#8212; not &#8220;lay low&#8221; &#8212; because plenty of people will be mad at me for having the gall to ask them to use the language correctly.</p>
<p>My question for them: what&#8217;s good about &#8220;democratization,&#8221; digital or otherwise, if we impoverish the medium of our work with it?</p>
<p>It occurs to me that one reason I may like music is that an A is not a B-flat. A quarter note is not a eighth note. The bass clef is not the treble clef. In music, you don&#8217;t get away with &#8220;laying down.&#8221; You <em>lie</em> down or the stuff doesn&#8217;t sound right. And while experimenters will come and go, composers and musicians realize that the written language with which they communicate depends on an accurate use of its structure and norms.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote"><p><em>Do you take responsibility for the language you ply?</em></p>
</div>
<p>Something about professional writers hurling entirely lowercased notes at each other on social <em>media</em> &#8212; still a plural word, damn it &#8212; is about as attractive as parents who try to dress like their kids to look hip.</p>
<p>Why did a self-described writer blithely announce to me recently in a comment that until she read one of my columns, she didn&#8217;t know that <em>medium</em> is the singular of <em>media</em>? Would you feel okay with a surgeon who&#8217;d never realized that <em>anesthesia</em> is the thing administered by the <em>anesthetist</em> over there in the corner of the operating room?</p>
<p>Gradually, the lack of specificity takes over, doesn&#8217;t it? The &#8220;shorthand&#8221; of &#8220;that&#8217;s just how people talk&#8221; gets ugly.</p>
<p>Someone rightly challenged a line in a new novel the other day, a book in which the protagonist ann0unced that she&#8217;d pinched herself to see if she was awake. If you have to write such sitcom rubbish as people pinching themselves to see if they&#8217;re awake &#8212; something no one does, by the way &#8212; why are you writing? If that&#8217;s the best you can do, what business do you have doing it?</p>
<h3>An Idiom of Selfhood</h3>

<p>The singularity of a creative voice like Paola Prestini&#8217;s is one of the things that makes her work stand with such regal significance. She sets a segment of <em>Oceanic Verses</em> in Griko in order to own the very problem that she&#8217;s exploring in the work. Her score itself now preserves a scrap of that dying language, how ingenious is that? She has entered the field of her own inquiry. She&#8217;s on a search for an &#8220;internal geography,&#8221; a place of belonging in the world, unique to each of us and so hard to find.</p>
<p>And if a writer can&#8217;t work in a comparable idiom of selfhood, has the job really been done?</p>
<p>Go ahead and tell me you can&#8217;t even. I&#8217;m not talking about a case in which you need to write in a teen&#8217;s standard lingo because your character is a 15-year-old in Dunedin, Florida. I mean your own voice as the <em>auteur</em> you are of your presence as a writer in the world. Is <em>OMG</em> really who you are? It is? Really? Oh, my God.</p>
<p>There may be more ways than fading for a language to die. Maybe it becomes trivialized to death.</p>
<p>Prestini is unusually eloquent in discussing her work. Those of us who interview dancers, composers, musicians, visual artists, know that strong verbal expression isn&#8217;t what you always find. When I mentioned to her that her own fluency is refreshing, she said that she feels that it&#8217;s part of her responsibility to speak cogently about music when asked. She accepts an idea that it&#8217;s incumbent on musical artists to make an intelligible case for their work in the world.</p>
<p>How many authors have you met who would say that they take responsibility for expressing the place and purpose of bookish work today?</p>
<p><strong><em>Do you take responsibility for the language you ply? Are you reading someone now who seems to stake a claim for &#8220;conscious&#8221; artistry as Paola Prestini does in her music? How many authors do you encounter who seem really aware of themselves in the language?</em></strong></p>

<h2><strong>The challenge: does this narrative <i>compel</i> you to turn the page?</strong></h2>
<p>Please judge by storytelling quality, not by genre—some reject an opening page immediately because of genre, but that’s not a good enough reason when the point is to analyze for storytelling strength.</p>

<p><strong>A First-page Checklist</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It begins <em>connecting the reader with the protagonist</em></li>
<li><em>Something is happening. </em>On a first page, this does NOT include a character musing about whatever.</li>
<li><em>What happens is dramatized</em> in an immediate scene with action and description plus, if it works, dialogue.</li>
<li>What happens <em>moves the story forward</em>.</li>
<li>What happens <em>has consequences</em> for the protagonist.</li>
<li>The protagonist <em>desires something</em>.</li>
<li>The protagonist <em>does something</em>.</li>
<li><em>There’s enough of a setting</em> to orient the reader as to where things are happening.</li>
<li>It <em>happens in the NOW</em> of the story.</li>
<li><em>Backstory? What backstory?</em> We’re in the NOW of the story.</li>
<li><em>Set-up? What set-up?</em> We’re in the NOW of the story.</li>
<li>What happens <em>raises a story question</em>—what happens next? or why did that happen?</li>
</ul>

<p>This novel was in first place on the <em>New York Times</em> hardcover fiction bestseller list for December 7, 2014. How strong is the opening page—would this have hooked an agent if it came in from an unpublished writer? Do you think it’s <em><strong>compelling</strong></em>? Reminder: “compelling” is much different than “interesting”—it means that you are <em>irresistibly</em> urged to turn the page by what you’ve read. Following are what would be the first 16 lines of Chapter 1.</p>
<blockquote><p>THE PRISON LOOKED more like the campus of a community college than a place where men were kept in cells for ten years or longer for offenses committed while wearing the uniform of their country. There were no guard towers, but there were two staggered twelve-foot-tall security fences, armed patrols, and enough surveillance cameras to keep an electronic eye on virtually every millimeter of the place. Situated at the northern end of Fort Leavenworth, the United States Disciplinary Barracks sat next to the Missouri River on nearly forty rolling, forested Kansas acres, a mound of brick and razor wire cradled by a green hand . It was the only maximum-security military prison for males in the country.</p>
<p>America’s foremost military prison was called the USDB, or the DB for short. The Leavenworth federal penitentiary for civilians, one of three prisons on the grounds of Fort Leavenworth, was four miles to the south. Along with the Joint Regional Correctional Facility—also for military prisoners—there was a fourth privately operated prison in Leavenworth, which raised the total inmate population among the four prisons to about five thousand. The Leavenworth Tourism Bureau, apparently seeking to capitalize on any bit of notoriety to lure visitors to the area, had incorporated the prison angle into its promotional brochures with the phrase “Doin’ time in Leavenworth.”</p></blockquote>

My vote and editorial notes after the fold.<br />

<p><a href="http://writerunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-Escape.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-34590" src="http://writerunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-Escape.jpg" alt="The Escape" width="200" height="301" /></a>Did you recognize David Baldacci and his <em>The Escape?</em> Was this opening page compelling if you picked it up to sample it in a bookstore?</p>
<p><strong>My vote: Nope</strong></p>
<p>Here’s something that Donald Maass said in one of his workshops at the 2014 Writer Unboxed Unconference: that it’s engagement with the protagonist that matters the most in creating a narrative that keeps the pages turning, and a lack of that is usually the first way good manuscripts fall short. He said that he feels engagement with a character is best begun on the first page.</p>
<p>That makes sense to me, especially coming from a man who has read and analyzed hundreds of novels. And that’s why this novel’s first page gets a no from me. There’s not even the hint of a person or character. Nor of a story. It is, no doubt, a fine summary of research about a prison. I can tell you that the first chapter is pretty much the same until, on the very last page, a prisoner mysteriously escapes from the prison. But, if I were picking this book up to look at in a bookstore or scrolling through sample pages on Amazon, I would never have gotten there.</p>
<p>I wish someone could tell me why best-selling authors who are clearly strong storytellers indulge in these hundreds on hundreds of words of exposition and set-up before getting to the story. It’s so similar to the chapter submissions I see from unpublished authors—the info-dumping of things that the writer believes the reader HAS to know . . . and almost invariably doesn’t.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that bestselling authors can&#8217;t write an opening page that captures us with a character and a story. So why not start with that rather than an info-dump? While I have not read the novel, I will wager you that an intimate and detailed knowledge of the nature of this prison does not impact the story in <em>any</em> way. The only important story aspect of the first chapter is the prisoner and his escape.</p>
<p>Your thoughts? Would you have turned the page?</p>
