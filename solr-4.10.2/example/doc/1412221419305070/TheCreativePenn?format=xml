				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s show, I talk to publishing expert Hugh McGuire about <strong>some of the biggest stories of 2014 and how they affect indie authors</strong>. We go through the state of audio, exclusivity and subscription models, discoverability and publishing startups, print on demand, Author Earnings and global development. Exciting times!</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.99designs.com/joanna/"><img class="alignright wp-image-20210 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/99designs-logo-750x200px-300x80.png" alt="99designs-logo-750x200px" width="300" height="80" /></a>This podcast episode is sponsored by <a title="99 designs" href="http://www.99designs.com/joanna/" target="_blank">99 Designs</a>, where you can get all kinds of designs for your author business including book covers, merchandising, branding and business cards, illustrations and artwork and much more.

<p><a href="http://pressbooks.com/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20709 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-04-at-2.02.43-pm-268x300.jpg" alt="hugh mcguire" width="268" height="300" /></a>Hugh McGuire is an author, professional speaker and publishing expert, the founder of <a href="http://pressbooks.com" target="_blank">PressBooks</a>, an online book publishing platform built on WordPress, and of <a href="http://librivox.org" target="_blank">LibriVox.org</a>, the largest library of free, public domain audiobooks in the world as well as lots of other things!</p>
<p><strong>Audio has been a big shift in 2014</strong>, with ACX opening up to UK authors and a big growth in the audio market. We discuss the popularity of audio and why it might be growing. Hugh mentions how the success of his company <a title="Iambik" href="http://www.iambik.com/" target="_blank">Iambik </a>was in the genre fiction categories, which is the same with ebooks. It&#8217;s still a niche market but worth looking at to extend your rights. As with any content, marketing is still really important to make a dent, although I point out that <strong>discoverability might be easier in audio</strong>, because there are fewer titles. The more channels you&#8217;re in, the more formats you&#8217;re in, the more likely you are to build a long-term business.</p>
<h2>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly fine to have a writing career that isn&#8217;t a business, but don&#8217;t complain when you don&#8217;t make any money at it.&#8221; Hugh McGuire, Pressbooks</h2>
<ul>
<li> We discuss <strong>exclusivity, Kindle Unlimited and subscription models</strong>. Authors have to decide what makes business sense in the short term as well as the long term. It makes sense for new authors to use exclusivity to get some movement, but if you have a longer term business model, a wider base of distribution is better. <strong>Subscription models</strong> are not designed to make money from one individual book, it&#8217;s more of a way to grow the amount people are reading altogether. These models are growing. You will always be better off growing your own email list so you can always reach people directly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discoverability and how some of the publishing startups looked like a great idea</strong>, but haven&#8217;t worked out quite yet! Hugh talks about how the self-containment of the e-reading eco-systems have stopped discoverability. We talk about <a title="readmill app" href="https://gigaom.com/2014/03/28/dropbox-acquires-and-absorbs-reading-app-readmill-app-will-be-shut-down/" target="_blank">Readmill</a>, which focused on social reading and was bought by Dropbox and shut down. We both liked <a title="small demons" href="http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-small-demons-to-close-unless-buyer-appears-20131106-story.html" target="_blank">Small Demons</a>, which looked at the cultural milieu around books e.g. what music is referenced within certain books and discovering other books that also mention that song. Unfortunately, they also went out of business. [Side note: I did ask them at a conference why they didn&#8217;t open up to indie authors so we could create content for them, but they only wanted to work with trad pub. I still like the idea!] We also talk about <a title="wattpad" href="http://www.wattpad.com" target="_blank">Wattpad</a>, which is a great startup that is thriving, although its user base may be quite different to mainstream publishing at the moment. And of course, we still love <a title="smashwords" href="http://www.smashwords.com/" target="_blank">Smashwords</a>, and Mark has always focused on indies!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a title="Pressbooks" href="http://pressbooks.com/" target="_blank">Pressbooks</a><a href="http://pressbooks.com/" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-20710 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-04-at-2.03.40-pm-300x87.jpg" alt="pressbooks" width="300" height="87" /></a> is based on producing beautiful print on demand files easily from your manuscript and the interface is built on WordPress so it&#8217;s easy for bloggers to use. There are multiple ebook outputs as well, but it&#8217;s focused on the print on demand aspect primarily. We discuss <strong>the importance of print to the market but how more print sales will go online over time</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global market expansion</strong>. We talk about whether the next big thing will come out of another territory. Hugh mentions that African countries are &#8216;skipping&#8217; technology e.g. moving directly to cellphones instead of landlines, and to mobile tech instead of desktops or laptops. There&#8217;s also fantastic innovation coming out of these other markets. English language authors do have an advantage as we&#8217;ve been thinking about this for several years now &#8211; compare this to French authors or other places where the digital revolution has barely begun.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a title="Author Earnings" href="http://authorearnings.com/" target="_blank">Author Earnings</a> and how supply is increasing. I talk about how my hope is that the romance authors are just ahead of the curve because they started earlier in digital, and that <strong>other genres will catch up in terms of % dominance by indie authors</strong>. In thrillers, it&#8217;s still dominated by trad pub, but we&#8217;re on our way up!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We discuss the fact that <strong>the &#8216;bleeding edge&#8217; of publishing is actually here already!</strong> The self-publishing big names are becoming small presses, publishing other people as H M Ward has now started doing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall, a positive time for creators!</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just did a fantastic event in Auckland, New Zealand, so a big thanks to everyone who came! Plus a big thanks to <a title="booktrack" href="http://www.booktrack.com" target="_blank">BookTrack</a> who sponsored and organized the event, as well as Auckland Libraries who hosted it.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.booktrack.com"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20594" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/booktracklogo.jpg" alt="booktrack" width="400" height="176" /></a>So what is Booktrack?</h2>
<p>First up, watch this quick video to get the idea about what it is &#8211; watch below or <a title="booktrack overview" href="http://youtu.be/59ixz6udGzQ" target="_blank">here on YouTube </a></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/59ixz6udGzQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In order to learn more about this, I interviewed Paul Cameron, CEO and co-founder of Booktrack about the service. In this video, we talk about why he and his brother started the company and what they want to achieve, as well as the benefits for authors and readers. You can watch below or <a title="paul cameron booktrack" href="http://youtu.be/REQAFhy0Sj8" target="_blank">here on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of our discussion include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People often read in public accompanied by a soundtrack of some kind &#8211; either to shut out ambient noise, or to accompany the story.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Books are (currently) one of the only entertainment choices that doesn&#8217;t have synchronized sound.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Authors often choose soundtracks as they write, and share it with readers. For example, check out the <a title="undercover soundtrack" href="http://mymemoriesofafuturelife.com/category/undercover-soundtrack/" target="_blank">Undercover Soundtrack on Roz Morris&#8217; blog </a></li>
<li>Booktrack takes a <strong>movie style soundtrack and synchronizes it with individual reading speed</strong> via apps. You can create these yourself for free &#8211; and it&#8217;s super fun!</li>
<li>Booktrack has a LOT of music and sound available to use &#8211; you can&#8217;t just use any music because of copyright</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.booktrackclassroom.com/#!/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-20596" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-25-at-3.38.08-pm-300x109.jpg" alt="booktrack classroom" width="300" height="109" /></a>They also have an education side, <a title="booktrack classroom" href="http://www.booktrackclassroom.com/#!/" target="_blank">Booktrack Classroom</a>, where schools are using books to help children engage with texts. <a title="university studies on retention" href="http://info.booktrackclassroom.com/university-studies" target="_blank">Studies show that people retain far more when they read with a soundtrack</a>. It&#8217;s also fun to create, and music means a lot for certain age groups.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I mention how soundtracks on film are designed to <strong>underscore emotional elements</strong>, and no film is complete now without a soundtrack. Booktrack is aiming to get to this point in the future.</li>
<li>Readers can find Booktrack on the app stores or online <a title="booktrack" href="http://www.booktrack.com" target="_blank">Booktrack.com</a> &#8211; it&#8217;s free to use and try at the moment.</li>
<li>The company&#8217;s aim is to become something similar to Audible but without words &#8211; <strong>selling books with soundtracks direct to consumers</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Book marketing is a constant challenge for us all and one way to <strong>stand out is by having more than just text available</strong>. If you can add sound to your words, it brings another atmospheric dimension to the reading experience, and may be enough to draw people into your book.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to do is to check out a few books. Here&#8217;s my <a title="one day in budapest" href="http://www.booktrack.com/read/cb3b35953dfd408fa4d4f5cf4541ca96" target="_blank">prologue for One Day In Budapest</a>, and <a title="Sand Hugh Howey" href="http://www.booktrack.com/read/73875b0430fd437cac7cbf9ff0bd8687" target="_blank">Hugh Howey&#8217;s Sand</a></p>
<p>You can easily share the Booktracks on social media and email, and coming soon, you&#8217;ll be able to use embeddable widgets on your website.</p>
<p>In terms of monetization, you can add a link to all the platforms where people can buy your book as part of the free aspect of the platform. In 2015, Booktracks will be available for sale, so could provide another revenue stream.</p>

<h2>Five useful tips for using Booktrack</h2>
<p>I asked author <a title="Dawn Grant" href="http://www.dcgrant.co.nz/" target="_blank">D.C.Grant </a>to share her tips for using the service. You can check out her book, <a title="where the flag floats" href="http://www.booktrack.com/read/fcd7cb6876494b33a4b5c4ccf18fc247" target="_blank">Where the flag floats, here on Booktrack</a>.</p>
<p>Dawn also has a book for authors, <a title="booktrack for authors" href="http://www.booktrack.com/#!/bookshelf?booktrackId=339829357ddf499db4684a1c3e04c9fb" target="_blank">The Booktrack Author User Guide</a>, which will help you if you want to do DIY.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.booktrack.com/read/fcd7cb6876494b33a4b5c4ccf18fc247"><img class="alignright wp-image-20612 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-27-at-8.52.44-am-172x300.jpg" alt="flag floats" width="172" height="300" /></a>When you are creating a sound track for your book using Booktrack, it is called booktracking.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Treat booktracking time like writing time</strong> – block off a period of time with no distractions, switch off email/ text message/social media notifications. Also limit or exclude other sounds, or work using a headset so that you can concentrate on the tracks.</li>
<li><strong>Booktrack short sections</strong> at a time. Don’t attempt to do too much all at once.</li>
<li><strong>Keep pen and paper handy</strong>, or a note-taking app like OneNote, to make a note of the tracks that appeal to you as you go through the results of your search criteria. It’ll be a certainty that you won’t remember the track that you liked on page 2 by the time you get to page 6.</li>
<li>If you find the diversity of music tracks overwhelming, <strong>search for a composer whose music suits the genre/theme of your book</strong> and make that your ‘go-to’ composer when choosing tracks. For a showcase of composers and the type of music they produce, use the Booktrack Music Showcase.</li>
<li><strong>Layer your sound</strong> – start with music, then layer on an ambience track and finish with sound effects. Or layer two ambience tracks and then sound effects. Or a music track and two ambience tracks and no sound effects. The choice is up to you. You can layer on as many tracks as you like, but too many and things may get muddled! <strong>Play it back</strong> to make sure it’s not too much and that the sound effects don’t get overwhelmed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Booktracking can appear daunting but there’s no better way to learn that to just jump in and do it! Have a go today.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Simon talks a bit about his background, with a degree in business</strong>, then working in Sri Lanka before moving to Prague. He started narrating audiobooks and working with indie authors, and then started his podcast, Rocking Self Publishing, before deciding to write a book about audiobooks to help authors get their books out there. We talk about the creative hub that Prague is turning into &#8230; We discuss entrepreneurship and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PW8TNX0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00PW8TNX0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=WPNVV7HYIWMKB4CX"><img class="alignright wp-image-20644 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-28-at-5.44.05-pm-196x300.jpg" alt="audiobooks for indies" width="196" height="300" /></a>the mindset shift from writing a book to running a business as an author.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why the audiobook market is growing so fast.</strong> Basically because Amazon is behind it, plus the advance of digital technology. People can consume while they do other things, and it&#8217;s on demand now through wireless technology. It can also help you stand out as there are far fewer books available in audio, plus Whispersync means people can combine editions on their Kindle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On ACX and how it works.</strong> You can also <a title="distributing with acx and marketing audiobooks" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/05/01/audiobooks-acx-marketing/" target="_blank">read more about my experience with ACX in publishing and marketing here</a>. We talk about pricing, ACX bounty, marketing, Whispersync and how the various payments work, as well as how to select a narrator.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best practices for working with a voice talent</strong>. We talk about adaptation, interpretation and respecting creative expression &#8211; as well as balancing it with how you want the book to be.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On fiction and non-fiction audiobooks.</strong> Often listeners want to hear the author read non-fiction, so if you can, narrate it yourself. For fiction, you need to do voices and things, so it&#8217;s best to get a professional. Simon talks about using basic equipment for audiobook narration &#8211; you don&#8217;t need to complicate things and it will only cost you a couple hundred $ to get started. Before you do anything, read your book out loud and see how you feel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Getting over your voice</strong>. We talk about becoming a narrator and how it can become another income stream, on when to take royalty split deals, and more. I am considering getting further into narration in 2015, only for non-fiction though.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On podcasting</strong> and when authors should consider it. We talk about the commitment in time per episode as well as how long it takes to get some traction with an audience. Like writing, it&#8217;s a long term game! We also talk a bit about <strong>video and YouTube</strong> &#8211; the most important thing is regular content. Most successful vloggers are doing videos several times a week. We also mention <a title="skype translator" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJIILew6l28#t=36" target="_blank">Skype Translator</a> &#8211; which translates as you speak &#8211; only in beginning stages, but wow! It&#8217;s like Star Trek!</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The fast-growing self-publishing environment is attracting all kinds of start-ups and companies that intend to serve authors.</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fensterbme/4783366926/ "><img class="alignleft wp-image-20513" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-16-at-5.40.24-pm-300x166.jpg" alt="editing" width="450" height="250" /></a>However, most of them seem to aim at the periphery of what authors really need, which in my opinion, is primarily editors and cover designers.</p>
<p>Then I met Ricardo Fayet at a number of events, and discovered that his start-up, <a title="Reedsy" href="https://reedsy.com/" target="_blank">Reedsy</a>, is aimed at connecting indie authors with editors and other professionals. The providers on the site are curated so you can trust that they offer a quality service.</p>
<p>Reedsy itself is a partner member of the <a title="alliance of independent authors" href="http://allianceindependentauthors.org/?affid=88" target="_blank">Alliance of Independent Authors</a>, which also gives it another level of trust, in my opinion. Here&#8217;s a piece on the company in <a title="techcrunch reedsy" href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/06/reedsy-launches-its-marketplace-for-indie-authors-to-unbundle-traditional-publishing-houses/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>.</p>
<p>I asked Ricardo a few questions about what he sees in successful indie authors and what Reedsy can do for them.</p>
<h2><strong>You go to a lot of author events. What are the commonalities you see in successful indie authors?</strong></h2>
<p>First, and this is something that has always struck me, I’m amazed at how <strong>indies are all such positive and energetic people</strong>. Or at least this is what they all appear to be (I know you have repeatedly said you have a<a title="JF Penn" href="http://www.jfpenn.com" target="_blank"> dark side</a> &#8211; I can’t imagine it, but I’ll take your word for it).</p>
<p>I think <strong>this kind of positive energy is absolutely key for indie authors today</strong>: you have got to believe that you can make it and persevere in your work with that belief until things begin to pick up. The process is slow and tedious and it’s easy to get discouraged after you’ve put the first couple of books out there and see they’re not selling themselves…</p>
<p>I also see <strong>a willingness to experiment.</strong> Distribution models have changed, and so have marketing ones. Thinking outside the traditional box usually pays off, but that requires a lot of trying new things and techniques, failing, and “iterating” (to use the start-up jargon).</p>
<p>Finally, I see<strong> union and an incredible willingness to help each other</strong>. All successful indie authors have become successful partly thanks to other authors. Bella Andre and Tina Folsom have been working together (literally) for years now. You have been interviewing authors for years too. <a title="alliance of independent authors" href="http://allianceindependentauthors.org/?affid=88" target="_blank">The Alliance of Independent Authors</a> was born out of this belief that indies don’t compete for space on the Kindle Store, they grow stronger together.</p>
<h2><strong>You&#8217;re a businessman and an entrepreneur with a start-up. What can indie authors learn from entrepreneurs? </strong></h2>
<p>All three points I mentioned in the previous questions! I think this is why we get on well together.</p>
<p><strong>As an entrepreneur, you also have to “build your team.”</strong> Once you do, entrepreneurs are faced with the same problem indies have once your product or your book is up and running: it doesn’t sell itself…</p>
<p>The difference is that entrepreneurs are often a little more educated about all the major challenges on the road from the start of their journey, whereas some starting authors go into self-publishing unprepared, or believing it will be relatively easy.</p>
<p>Start-up entrepreneurs are pushed by their investors to sell, so they market their product before it’s live, they beta-test it before releasing it, they continually improve it afterwards, etc. <strong>This pressure makes us more creative in our marketing efforts</strong>, and I think indie authors could get a lot of ideas by following the start-ups in their industry, reading their newsletters and observing their marketing efforts.</p>
<p>In way, it’s very difficult to remain oblivious to these challenges as an entrepreneur &#8211; there’s no temptation to develop a product in an ivory tower because it’s not an option.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://reedsy.com"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-20512" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/blog_post_image-300x168.jpg" alt="reedsy" width="300" height="168" /></a>One of the biggest problems for indie authors is finding professionals to work with. How does Reedsy help with this issue?</strong></h2>
<p>There’s all kinds of problems with finding good editors, designers, basically any variety of professional. Reedsy makes it easy to find and work with the best professionals &#8211; emphasis on both ‘easy’ and ‘best.’</p>
<p>Take editors as an example. First of all, there’s the challenge of finding them &#8211; Google is awesome, but if you search for ‘freelance editors’ you’re not being shown the best editors, but rather the editors who are best at SEO. Basically, there’s not much of a connection between visibility and quality.</p>
<p>Eventually you make your shortlist, and start exploring working together &#8211; maybe making a spreadsheet along the way of prices, of terms, sending out samples for editing, comparing what you get back… All which is this process you have to micromanage by designing a custom email folder hierarchy…</p>
<p>And that doesn’t even get into what’s involved in tracking drafts and the evolution of a manuscript across multiple rounds of editing. It’s exhausting.</p>
<div id="attachment_20514" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-20514" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-16-at-5.44.32-pm-215x300.jpg" alt="editing" width="250" height="348" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Example of Reedsy editor search with some of the freelancers available</p></div>
<p>So, Reedsy is an easy solution to all of this hassle. We have a growing network of great freelancers &#8211; respectful of their clients, established, experienced, skilled. You’ll be able to manage messaging freelancers, sending  and comparing sample edits, receiving quotes, and negotiating terms from one website. And when you start working together you’ll be able to track the history of the entire collaboration, from the very beginning, through our upcoming gorgeous editor.</p>
<p>The best thing about Reedsy is we make things easier for indie authors without taking away control. We make it an easy process, without taking it out of the author’s hands. That’s really important.</p>
<h2><strong>How can an author evaluate whether an editor or designer is the right one for them?</strong></h2>
<p>There’s all kinds of things authors need to think about when choosing who they want to work with. Looking at previous projects is an important one &#8211; not just whether the work is in a similar genre to your own work, but how you feel about the work that came out of the collaboration, whether you like the text after editing or like the cover design.</p>
<p>Authors should be totally honest about what they’re looking for from the freelancer. Not just because it’s important to make sure that expectations are clear all around, but to see how the freelancer responds. Collaborating with someone creatively can be intense, and it’s difficult to know how it’s going to go. Jumping in and being upfront about what you what (if you know what you want), or admitting your ignorance (if you don’t know what you need help with), can lead to a productive conversation. The earlier this happens, the better.</p>
<h2><strong>What else will Reedsy have coming up for authors?</strong></h2>
<p>Reedsy has a very specific purpose &#8211; to support independent authors. We’re building Reedsy like a toolbox. We’re starting with making something that can help with finding editors and designers. Naturally, we’ll add other professions over time &#8211; right now we’re planning to include publicists, narrators and translators.</p>
<p>But there are other tools we want to build for authors. The first of these is a text editor designed to support the process of creating book-length works, as well as making it more natural to share that work with your editor. We basically want to be more than a simple marketplace, and add value to the collaborations. This is why we’ll release the first set of project management tools in a few weeks only…</p>
<h2><strong>Would you consider having translators there too?</strong></h2>
<p>This should come in a month or two, yes. We’ll start with translators “into English” (not from), as we know many foreign authors wish to enter the US and UK markets but are unsure where to start… And also because translating is actually that: just a start! The book then needs to be copy-edited and/or proofread (in English), the cover needs to be modified (or redesigned), and the launch has to be accompanied by a marketing effort (in English).</p>
<p>On Reedsy, we already have all these resources (US/UK editors and designers), so foreign authors would access the full suite of services they need to really penetrate a new market. We’re going to be like Ellis Island for foreign authors arriving to the English-speaking market.</p>
<h2><strong>How can people find out more about Reedsy?</strong></h2>
<p>Our homepage &#8211; <a href="http://www.reedsy.com">www.reedsy.com</a> &#8211; would be a great start! If you’re an author, it’s free to sign up to the site and take a look around at who we have on the marketplace. If you’re a freelancer, it’s both free and very easy to build a profile and wait to be approached by authors. Reedsy is currently free during this beta stage, so there’s no reason not to take a look!</p>
<p>The other way of learning more is by asking us. We love the way the indie community supports itself, and we’re a part of that community. If you want a hand with anything, or want to know more, let us know and we’ll do what we can to help.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How David started writing</strong> in the 1980s and won a number of awards early on, as well as writing for many gaming and popular sci-fi properties plus green-lighting for Hollywood screenwriting. He started teaching and his students included Stephenie Meyer, James Dashner and Brandon Sanderson. His rules are that a project has to be fun and he has to be able to make some money at whatever he&#8217;s doing.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1614751765/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1614751765&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=WJNRKB5VNMCYUMDN"><img class="alignright wp-image-20538 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-19-at-1.30.09-pm-184x300.jpg" alt="million dollar outline" width="184" height="300" /></a>Writing the Million Dollar Outline</h2>
<ul>
<li>If it is your goal to write a bestselling novel, then you do need to consider certain principles. <strong>Write what you love but then figure out how to write for a wider audience than you started with</strong>. For example, old and young, male and female. The Harry Potter books clearly appeal to many different age groups.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transport your reader to another time and/or place.</strong> Generally speaking, the top 50 books and films of all time do this. We discuss the importance of length in this aspect – despite the recent move to shorter books, the biggest books of all time are doorstop size. You can use novellas over time to create &#8216;mega-novel&#8217; series though, and a lot of people are using this strategy, particularly in romance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>It must score high on the emotional Richter scale.</strong> It needs to impact people deeply and be remarkable so you get that word of mouth</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The word genre is really about emotions</strong> e.g. mystery = intrigue, thrillers = adventure, horror, comedy, fantasy &amp; sci-fi = wonder, romance = love. Nostalgia is another powerful emotion.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1614751749/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1614751749&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=KQVOOAGKAPCYM57S"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20539 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-19-at-1.30.28-pm-187x300.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2014-11-19 at 1.30.28 pm" width="187" height="300" /></a>Drawing on the power of resonance in writing</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resonance arouses an expectation that you&#8217;re going to like this type of book</strong>. Genre conventions are one aspect, cover design another, mentioning other books that people like is another. This is why similar tropes and characters are reused, as they have built in resonance. A good example was the recent Lego movie which was packed with resonance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This is not about plagiarism or re-using other material, but <strong>consciously choosing to riff off earlier ideas</strong>. David goes through the layers of resonance within Pirates of the Caribbean all the way back over centuries. You still have to be original, but add a twist on the past e.g. Meyer&#8217;s sparkly vampires.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Longevity and your career as a fiction writer</h2>
<ul>
<li>You have to be a good storyteller and be able to write well. <strong>There are a lot of skills you need to learn in order to be successful fiction author and it&#8217;s equivalent to getting a doctorate degree.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>It takes about 7 years to become &#8216;publishable&#8217; and another 7 years to become a bestselling author.</strong> To be one of the best, you have to take that onwards to the next level. <em>[I love this because I&#8217;ve been writing fiction for 4 years, so I am halfway through the apprenticeship!]</em> There are people who have some kind of special talent, but most great authors work really hard and practice over years.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On paying attention to dreams and writing them down</strong>. It&#8217;s your sub-conscious talking to you! David talks about his process, thinking about his plot before bed so he can dream about it that night and then write in the morning. Keep a notebook or computer handy at all times!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On fun and hard work as a writer. </strong>You have to consider your creative muse and not do the projects that don&#8217;t bring you alive. Figure out how to stay out of the ruts that the industry will try to put you in.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On author name and branding.</strong> Dave&#8217;s real name, Wolverton, put him on the bottom of shelves in bookstores so when he started writing, he changed to the name David Farland. That is less important in a digital market.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loving the craft is critical for longevity</strong>, or why would you bother! You can always learn something new so there is a sense of a career path ahead. Understanding the markets and being aware of what people want is critical.</li>
</ul>
<h2>On self-publishing</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mystorydoctor.com/"><img class="alignright wp-image-20544" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-19-at-2.16.29-pm-300x250.jpg" alt="my story doctor" width="250" height="209" /></a>It&#8217;s great to be able to publish in many different ways, and Dave self-publishes his books on writing. But <strong>sometimes authors are publishing too early</strong> and are slightly delusional in terms of their ability and expectations of income. It&#8217;s a great way to publish, but you need to learn the craft and get critical feedback before you can expect success.</li>
</ul>

<p>I started out with a <a title="business models for authors" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/07/25/creative-entrepreneur-business-models/" target="_blank">business model </a>of education through video courses, but now I focus more on books and sales through other online platforms.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a<a title="eu vat change" href="http://onemanbandaccounting.co.uk/eu-vat-changes-2015/" target="_blank"> law change in the EU</a> which means I will have to do a ton more compliance paperwork if I keep selling direct from 1 Jan 2015, and because my intention was to stop doing these over time, this has just accelerated the change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>I love to learn, and I&#8217;ve been sharing what I learn on this blog for almost 6 years now!</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/anned/8700093610/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20571" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-24-at-12.29.15-pm-300x198.jpg" alt="still learning" width="450" height="298" /></a>I had an email from a lady the other week and she asked me, <strong>&#8220;How do you continue when things are tough?&#8221;</strong> This could be about writing, or just life in general, but for me, it&#8217;s about constantly learning from others and changing based on what I learn.</p>
<p>When I first started this site, my mentors were people making a full-time living online and the mindset of entrepreneurship &#8211; <a title="from affirmation to reality" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2011/09/12/creative-author/" target="_blank">which helped me escape my day job</a>.</p>
<p>Then I learned about writing books and non-fiction, and then about writing fiction and deeper creativity. I feel like I circle around these topics, learning new things from new people all the time. I devour books every week, writing copious notes in my many Moleskine notebooks. I&#8217;m a learning junkie, but I also try to put things into action, and this keeps me constantly motivated.</p>
<h2>There have been some key mentors in my life, but all their teaching has come from books, seminars and online programs, not from 1:1 discussion.</h2>
<p>These people put their knowledge out in multiple formats to help a broader spectrum at one time, and I now try to do the same. When people email me asking to be mentored, I say &#8216;go read my books, read this blog, listen to the podcasts, or come and hear me speak&#8217; that&#8217;s how I pass on the mentoring relationship. I hope you will do the same with what you learn.</p>
<p>Our mentors change over time, so I wanted to highlight some of mine at the moment.</p>
<h2>Robert McKee STORY conference</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060391685/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060391685&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=NKM4T6GWPEX2QFLN"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20568 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-24-at-12.06.53-pm-196x300.jpg" alt="story" width="196" height="300" /></a>I&#8217;ve just returned from the<a title="McKee STORY" href="http://mckeestory.com/" target="_blank"> 4 day intensive STORY course</a> taught by Robert McKee, and it was absolutely mind-blowing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve now written <a title="McKee STORY" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/books/" target="_blank">8 fiction books</a> &#8211; from short stories, to novellas and novels, and I felt that this was exactly the right time for me to learn what he had to teach. I was going to blog about what I learned but seriously, I have 130 pages of notes and it was way too deep to try and capture in sound-bites. I&#8217;m also going to be processing for a few weeks before trying to incorporate it all into my 2015 creative works. It&#8217;s not about screenwriting, so much as story itself and how that resonates through people for maximum human impact.</p>
<p>If you want to check out this stuff, <a title="McKee STORY" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060391685/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060391685&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=NKM4T6GWPEX2QFLN" target="_blank">read the book STORY</a>, and if you are serious about investing in your creative writing career, then take the <a title="McKee STORY" href="http://mckeestory.com/" target="_blank">multi-day seminar</a>. He also has an <a title="storylogue" href="http://www.storylogue.com/" target="_blank">online video program, Storylogue,</a> but to be honest, I think the live experience is far superior (but obviously more expensive!)</p>
<h2>Dean Wesley Smith &amp; Kristine Kathryn Rusch</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BI88VGI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BI88VGI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=OHG53GGTJAIF7SC7"><img class="alignright wp-image-20567 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-24-at-12.06.29-pm-191x300.jpg" alt="perfection" width="191" height="300" /></a>Dean and Kris have 30+ years as full-time writers and they&#8217;ve seen the full spectrum of what the publishing industry can offer &#8211; from trad pub deals, to indie, to owning their own publishing company and physical bookstore.</p>
<p>Their advice is completely devoid of any hype or short term tactics, it&#8217;s all about <strong>creating a long-term successful career</strong> as an author. They are also both prolific writers and incredibly humble, plus they&#8217;re fun, and seem to have a good marriage <img src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> What better mentors to have!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read all their various non-fiction books and taken a number of courses. The ones that have particularly helped me are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="pursuit of perfections" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BI88VGI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BI88VGI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=OHG53GGTJAIF7SC7" target="_blank">The Pursuit of Perfection and How It Harms Writers</a></li>
<li><a title="productivity workshop" href="http://www.deanwesleysmith.com/online-workshops/" target="_blank">Course on Productivity</a> &#8211; how to write more words per day, get more hours in the chair and get out of your own way.</li>
<li><a title="dean lectures" href="http://www.deanwesleysmith.com/lecture-series/" target="_blank">Paying the Price Lecture</a> &#8211; for those who take this writing life seriously and want to have longevity in the market</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steven Pressfield</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087TUM54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0087TUM54&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=Z7RLSTOZROPQKVI7"><img class="alignleft wp-image-13657 size-full" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/turningpro.jpg" alt="Turning Pro Steven Pressfield" width="191" height="286" /></a><a title="turning pro" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087TUM54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0087TUM54&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=Z7RLSTOZROPQKVI7" target="_blank">Turning Pro</a> is the only book I own in print, ebook and audiobook. Pressfield kicks my ass every time I read or listen to it, and I make sure to read it every January to assess whether or not I am closer to being a &#8216;pro.&#8217;</p>
<p>When<a title="steven pressfield podcast" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/06/18/steven-pressfield/" target="_blank"> I interviewed Steve earlier this year on my podcast</a>, it was a true pinnacle, because talking to someone who had been a mentor to me for years was very special. You&#8217;ll hear it in my voice &#8211; I am a little star-struck!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been listening to the <a title="audiobook turning pro" href="http://www.blackirishbooks.com/store/turning-pro/" target="_blank">audiobook of Turning Pro</a> in the last few weeks, trying to up my creative game. Pressfield&#8217;s books are really about mindset and what really matters, leaving behind the ephemeral to get to the heart of why we do what we do.</p>
<p>His quote from Krishna is particularly important to me right now:<strong> &#8220;You have the right to your labor, not the fruits of your labor.&#8221; </strong>Think on that before moaning about book sales!<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<h2>Tony Robbins</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476757801/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1476757801&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=UOFVBLOYNKK67EIU"><img class="alignright wp-image-20558 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-19-at-2.47.10-pm-200x300.jpg" alt="money tony robbins" width="200" height="300" /></a>I&#8217;ve said before that I was so inspired by Tony&#8217;s self-help books and information that my aim was to become a professional speaker like him, and change people&#8217;s lives in the way he does. His book, <a title="awaken the giant within" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671791540/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0671791540&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=TEWO7MCVPZ7WYFOV" target="_blank">Awaken the Giant Within</a>, helped me to overcome a lot of mindset issues and start to create, another pivotal moment in my move from IT consultant to creativity. I&#8217;ve never been to one of his live events, although that is on my list for the next couple of years.</p>
<p>But Tony makes my list again at the moment because of his new book, <a title="money master the game" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476757801/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1476757801&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=UOFVBLOYNKK67EIU" target="_blank">Money: Master the Game</a>. It&#8217;s his first book in many years and comes from his anger over the 2008 global financial crisis and how the lack of financial education costs people far more than they could imagine. I consider myself a decent enough business-woman, but I have made my share of financial mistakes, both in business and in property. I&#8217;ve been reading this book slowly, and will continue to re-read until I understand it and have made the changes necessary to my own financial setup. It&#8217;s incredibly value packed and may change your life! I have bought the print edition as well as digital as it is the kind of book you need to digest slowly.</p>
<h2>Various podcasts</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-15030" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/smallpodcast.jpg" alt="podcast" width="133" height="126" />I listen to podcasts when I do chores or go to the gym, or travel and I find it&#8217;s a great way to learn about new things and discover lessons learned from people in all walks of life. I&#8217;m loving the <a title="tim ferriss podcast" href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/" target="_blank">Tim Ferriss show</a> at the moment and particularly enjoyed this <a title="kevin kelly" href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/08/29/kevin-kelly/" target="_blank">episode with Kevin Kelly</a>. I also like the <a title="james altucher show" href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/category/thejamesaltuchershow/" target="_blank">James Altucher show</a>, particularly <a title="altucher adams" href="http://www.stansberryradio.com/James-Altucher/Latest-Episodes/Episode/736/Ep-47-Scott-Adams-The-Secret-to-Dilbert-s-Success" target="_blank">this episode with Scott Adams, of Dilbert fame</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of self-publishing and related topics, I also listen to the <a title="self publishing podcast" href="https://selfpublishingpodcast.com/" target="_blank">Self-Publishing Podcast</a> (for laughs NSFW), the <a title="sell more books show" href="http://sellmorebooksshow.com/" target="_blank">Sell More Books show</a> (for news and marketing tips), the <a title="rocking self publishing podcast" href="http://rockingselfpublishing.com/" target="_blank">Rocking Self Publishing Podcast </a>(for deeper interviews with top self-publishers), and I&#8217;ve just started listening to<a title="the author biz" href="http://theauthorbiz.com/" target="_blank"> the Author Biz</a>, about author-entrepreneurship.</p>
<h2>Put away your self-development inner cynic!</h2>
<p>I hope I don&#8217;t have too many cynics in my audience &#8211; after all, my relentless positivity would probably put you off over time! The world I live is in brimming with possibilities and exciting projects and a never-ending stream of learning and creating. If your world doesn&#8217;t feel that way, then you need a kick in the creative rear!</p>
<p>These are just a few of my mentors at the moment who help me push the boundaries of what I can achieve in my week, my year and my life. You will need to find your own mentors for what you need to learn, but DO find them. After all, if you&#8217;re the smartest person in the room, you&#8217;re in the wrong room!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">I&#8217;d love to hear about some of your mentors, now or in the past, preferably from books/seminars/courses so others can benefit. Please do leave a comment below and join the conversation.</span></h3>

<p>In today&#8217;s episode, I talk about book cover design with <a title="book covers creativindie" href="http://bookcovers.creativindie.com/" target="_blank">Derek Murphy,</a> who designs all my book covers, plus we discuss the importance of artists also being entrepreneurial.</p>
<p>In the intro, I talk about my writing updates on <em>Gates of Hell</em> and <em>One Day in New York, </em>as well as the STORY conference I am going to with Robert McKee. I also mention the <a title="christmas thriller giveaway" href="http://thecreativepenn.com/christmas/" target="_blank">Christmas thriller giveway &#8211; win 12 print books here</a>.

<ul>
<li>Derek talks about his background in writing, studying at Taiwan University and his life abroad studying and writing, as well as fine art. He explains how he started an editing business and then moved into book cover design. In terms of marketing, book cover design business builds by word of mouth, whereas many authors won&#8217;t talk about the editing process. He&#8217;s traveled a lot internationally although he is American, studying in Malta in philosophy and theology and is now doing a PhD in Literature. We discuss academia vs entrepreneurship, and how to foster the latter by learning over time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>It&#8217;s important for artists to learn how to sell, as well as create, if they want to make a living from this.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MT9QYCI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00MT9QYCI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=CKFCP2VJ5L76RWUQ"><img class="alignright wp-image-20449 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-12-at-1.23.01-pm-202x300.jpg" alt="book cover design" width="202" height="300" /></a>What are the trends right now in book covers? For non-fiction, <em>Bebas neue</em> is being used a lot, and in fact, using fonts and words is prevalent in non-fiction in general, instead of being image heavy. For fiction, it depends on the genre.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>A big mistake for fiction authors with covers</strong> &#8211; trying to convey the whole story of the book on the cover with aspects of every scene, so it is very over-complicated. You really only have a couple of seconds to catch attention, and that&#8217;s the job of the book cover. It needs to convey genre, and be good looking so the reader knows they want more. If the reader is attracted, they will read title, book description and then get a sample.</li>
</ul>
<h2><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-20445" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/person-on-cover-300x140.jpg" alt="person-on-cover" width="300" height="140" />Using a person on the cover vs using a theme on the cover.</h2>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ve <a title="changing book cover design" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/03/11/changing-book-covers/" target="_blank">reinvented my Desecration book cover design to resonate more with genre and use a person on the front</a>, but sales are inconclusive. Derek talks about a cover he did recently (shown left) which has a reinvented theme only in the center and then with a person added as well &#8211; which do you prefer? A person is relatable so it has some kind of emotional impact. <a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/03/11/changing-book-covers/"><img class="alignright wp-image-18615 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/remake-300x253.jpg" alt="remake desecration" width="300" height="253" /></a>But in the end, the quality of the cover will make a huge cover.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We talk about the <strong>different cultural perspectives on covers</strong> &#8211; American covers vs European vs Asian. Cultural snobbery around literary covers in Britain does impact the design but may mean they don&#8217;t sell as well in America. Think about your target market and browse the categories in the country store for that market and make sure that your cover appeals to that market. Right now, we can&#8217;t upload different covers by market, but hopefully that will come at some point</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Big name author book covers and big name author websites &#8211; often they are not optimized to sell books, because those authors will sell books anyway. <strong>Over-complicating your covers and website is a bad idea for indies.</strong> The point of the cover is to get attention in the genre. The point of the website is to attract people to your email list and show up in search.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The most beautiful thing on your website should be your book covers.</h2>
<ul>
<li>On <strong>color palette, emotional resonance and genr</strong>e. It&#8217;s basic color psychology, which works all over the place e.g. what colors are used in hospitals vs boardrooms.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Top 3 bad things about indie book covers.</strong> Colors are a really obvious issue, and a color wash to neutralize the elements will help a lot. The font choice and effects are also important, and using drop shadows to make the font stand out is a classic error. You should use shading and font <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HC6HQ70/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00HC6HQ70&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=DF6BER3LKI3O756T"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20454 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-12-at-1.44.07-pm-203x300.jpg" alt="book marketing is dead" width="203" height="300" /></a>choice to make it stand out. An another issue is the amount of text on the cover. You don&#8217;t want to cram it full of text, especially for fiction in terms of quotes, sub-titles etc. We talk about the <a title="book cover design awards" href="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/2014/09/e-book-cover-design-awards-august-2014/" target="_blank">eBook Cover Design Awards on The Book Designer </a>which is a great site to find designers and see what works.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Finding and working with a book cover designer</h2>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s not necessarily about them being nice! You don&#8217;t want to be the one doing the design, you don&#8217;t want them to do what you want, because you don&#8217;t know about design. Trust your designer because of their experience. I have a list of <a title="book cover design" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/bookcoverdesign/" target="_blank">book cover designers here</a>. To get a good cover design, you will be paying quite a bit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Derek has a lot of tools for authors who want to try it themselves. Here&#8217;s <a title="book cover design" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2013/10/20/book-cover-design-ms-word/" target="_blank">how to make your own cover in MS Word</a>, and here&#8217;s a whole load of templates on <a title="DIY Book covers" href="http://diybookcovers.com/" target="_blank">DIYBookCovers.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>On becoming more entrepreneurial</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is critical for authors and artists. You need to think about the reader, the product, the marketing, the business side &#8211; once you&#8217;ve at least written that first book. Marketing doesn&#8217;t work if you have a product that nobody wants. Think about creating value for other people. How can you improve other people&#8217;s lives? How can you entertain, educate or inspire? Derek talks about some of the ideas he has at the moment &#8211; he&#8217;s an entrepreneurial machine! We also talk about fear of failure and how you have to get past that as an entrepreneur.</li>
<li>Derek talks about his own novel, Shearwater, and what he&#8217;s doing with his own books going forward.</li>
</ul>

(http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/derekcovers-201x300.png)Professional editing and professional cover design.
In today's episode, I talk about book cover design with Derek Murphy, (http://bookcovers.creativindie.com/) who designs all my book covers, plus we discuss the importance of artists also being entrepreneurial.

In the intro, I talk about my writing updates on Gates of Hell and One Day in New York, as well as the STORY conference I am going to with Robert McKee. I also mention the Christmas thriller giveway - win 12 print books here (http://thecreativepenn.com/christmas/). I'm speaking in Auckland, New Zealand on Tues 16 Dec, click here for more details (http://www.thecreativepenn.com/nz14/), as well as at PubSenseSummit  (http://www.pubsensesummit.com/)in Charleston in March 2015.

(http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-12-at-12.40.49-pm-202x300.jpg)Derek Murphy is an author, cover designer and entrepreneur at Creativindie.com (http://www.creativindie.com), as well as working on his PhD in Literature.

You can listen above or on iTunes (https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-creative-penn/id309426367) or Stitcher (http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-creative-penn-podcast), watch the interview on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb8eeRtoo4Q), or read the notes and links below.

	* Derek talks about his background in writing, studying at Taiwan University and his life abroad studying and writing, as well as fine art. He explains how he started an editing business and then moved into book cover design. In terms of marketing, book cover design business builds by word of mouth, whereas many authors won't talk about the editing process. He's traveled a lot internationally although he is American, studying in Malta in philosophy and theology and is now doing a PhD in Literature. We discuss academia vs entrepreneurship, and how to foster the latter by learning over time.

It's important for artists to learn how to sell, as well as create, if they want to make a living from this.

	* (http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-12-at-1.23.01-pm-202x300.jpg)What are the trends right now in book covers? For non-fiction, Bebas neue is being used a lot, and in fact, using fonts and words is prevalent in non-fiction in general, instead of being image heavy. For fiction, it depends on the genre.


	* A big mistake for fiction authors with covers - trying to convey the whole story of the book on the cover with aspects of every scene, so it is very over-complicated. You really only have a couple of seconds to catch attention, and that's the job of the book cover. It needs to convey genre, and be good looking so the reader knows they want more. If the reader is attracted, they will read title, book description and then get a sample.

(http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/person-on-cover-300x140.jpg)Using a person on the cover vs using a theme on the cover.

	* We've reinvented my Desecration book cover design to resonate more with genre and use a person on the front (http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/03/11/changing-book-covers/), but sales are inconclusive.</itunes:summary>

<li>The<strong> theme of good and evil</strong> is resonant in all my fiction, as well as aspects of my own travels and experiences</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Everybody wants to know the best way to write, to publish, to market.</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/airflore/3779918167/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20491" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-13-at-7.13.39-pm-300x224.jpg" alt="skiing" width="450" height="336" /></a>But although there are tracks to follow and experts to emulate, there really is no single right way to do anything in the author life. We will all have a different journey.</p>
<h2>Imagine that you want to ski down a hill.</h2>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t ski, hopefully you&#8217;ve seen enough Bond movies to know how it works! It&#8217;s similar to our journey through life and also applies to writing, marketing and any kind of business or career.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<h2>(1) Your path is not a straight line. You have to zigzag.</h2>
<p>Even though you know the general direction you want to head in, you can&#8217;t direct yourself straight down the mountain, or you will certainly have an accident.</p>
<p>Even pros have to change direction and turn their skis across the slope. There is no direct path, so don&#8217;t expect there to be.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also not just one path &#8211; everyone has a different route to get down, so you can try to follow other people&#8217;s example but you will end up carving your own path. In my book, <a title="career change" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/careerchange/" target="_blank">Career Change</a>, I talk about all my various failed businesses before I found my true path as an author. It&#8217;s a zigzag journey for us all.</p>
<h2>(2) It&#8217;s easier to turn once you&#8217;re moving.</h2>
<p>You need some momentum in order to turn on skis, so you actually have to get moving before you try.</p>
<p>In the same way, you actually have to start writing in order to have something to edit and improve. You have to start with a crappy website so you can learn how to make it better.</p>
<p>You have to start marketing somehow so you can learn what works for you and improve over time.</p>
<h2>(3) You can&#8217;t learn it all from books: you have to get on the slope.</h2>
<p>You can&#8217;t be a great skier by reading about it or going to seminars or watching YouTube videos. You actually have to put in the hours skiing.</p>
<p>The same applies to writing, publishing and marketing. People often assume that I have some kind of degree in marketing, but I don&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve just been out there every day for five years learning on the slopes – emulating the pros, yes – but mainly doing it for myself.</p>
<h2>(4) You&#8217;re going to fall over and it&#8217;s going to hurt. But you get better over time.</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re afraid of falling over, you will never be a good skier. Because you will fall, it happens a lot and it has to happen if you&#8217;re going to push yourself to get better and go on more advanced runs. So be prepared to fall, to fail, and to just get up again. Keep writing, keep putting your words out and keep experimenting with marketing.</p>
<h2>(5) Some days, the weather is perfect and you can see for miles and the sun is shining and it&#8217;s amazing!</h2>
<p>This is meant to be fun!</p>
<p>Yes, being an author can be a career and an income, but it&#8217;s also a passion. The reason we keep going back to skiing, keep going back up the slope, is that <strong>there is exhilaration and joy in the process, not just the outcome</strong> of getting to the bottom.</p>
<p>Some days, the weather will be perfect and we will have amazing runs on pristine, soft snow. Other days, the icy cold will make us grit our teeth to even manage one run and we wish we hadn&#8217;t bothered. But we keep going back because we love it, and those amazing days when it all falls into place make it worth it!</p>
