				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Writers love their beta readers. But let&#8217;s be honest. Beta readers also kinda drive us crazy. Some of them are perfection: as polite, professional, and talented as any in-house editor. But others&#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say their lack of tact and their questionable knowledge of the craft can sometimes leave us howling in frustration. Why isn&#8217;t there a manual for beta reader etiquette&#8211;for how beta readers should conduct themselves and how writers, in turn, should respond?</p>
<p>A few weeks ago on Facebook, a reader asked if I&#8217;d written a post on beta reader etiquette. I hadn&#8217;t, so today I&#8217;m remedying that oversight. Because trading critiques is the time-honored mode of reimbursement between writers, most of us will end up wearing both the beta-reader hat and the being-beta-read hat more times than we can count. In the interest of keeping peace and patience amongst ourselves and, even more importantly, maximizing our helpfulness to one another, let&#8217;s consider ten bits of beta reader etiquette and eight bits of writerly etiquette in response.</p>
<h2>The 10 Rules of Beta Reader Etiquette</h2>
<h3>1. Be Honest</h3>
<p>You can&#8217;t be useful to fellow writers unless you&#8217;re willing to be honest with them: about the good and the bad of their stories. No, you don&#8217;t want to hurt any feelings, but just assume that <a title="Putting Your Writer’s Ego in Your Back Pocket" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2008/06/putting-your-ego-in-your-back-pocket.html" target="_blank">any writer who asks your opinion will be big enough to handle even a negative response</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Be Specific</h3>
<p>Generalities like, &#8220;I loved it!&#8221; or &#8220;Your plot was boring!&#8221; aren&#8217;t going to be much help. Even if you start out with only a gut feeling about the story, do your best to figure out <em>why</em> you liked or disliked something. Give your writer friend something concrete on which to build his revisions.</p>
<h3>3. Couch Criticism in Praise</h3>
<p>The whole point of a critique is the criticism. But be a sport and don&#8217;t be <em>too</em> rough on a writer&#8217;s delicate ego. Say what you gotta say about the book&#8217;s faults, but couch your criticism in praise. Whenever you can, be lavish in your comments on a bo0k&#8217;s good points. Open your critique by telling the writer what you liked best, and sum up with either a generally positive opinion or a belief that the author will be able to refine his rough draft into something good.</p>
<h3>4. Avoid Negative Absolutes</h3>
<p>Insofar as honesty allows, try to avoid negative absolutes: &#8220;This book is awful.&#8221; &#8220;I hated this character.&#8221; &#8220;Your theme is nonexistent.&#8221; Focus on the fix, rather than the problem: &#8220;I recommend using a more cheerful tone.&#8221; &#8220;<a title="Why Your Hero Absolutely Must Pet the Dog" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2011/09/why-your-hero-absolutely-must-pet-dog.html" target="_blank">What if you let this character pet a dog?</a>&#8221; &#8220;Have you considered a theme for this story?&#8221; Even writers who <em>want</em> to hear all your criticism will grow resistant to accepting it if you put them on the defensive.</p>
<h3>5. Observe Deadlines</h3>
<p>Aside from the fact that most writers will be chewing their fingernails with anticipation from the moment they send you their precious manuscript, they&#8217;ve also probably got some serious deadlines to meet. So once you agree to a timeline, try your darndest to meet it. Yes, you&#8217;re doing the writer a favor, but he&#8217;s also depending on you. If you&#8217;re going to be unable to meet the deadline, always take a moment to let the writer know about the delay.</p>
<h3>6. Observe Standard Editing Protocol</h3>
<p>Make things easier for both yourself and the writer by observing standard editing protocol. Either use Word&#8217;s Track Changes to mark your comments and corrections right into the manuscript, or use standard editing symbols for marking up a hardcopy. No need to waste either the writer&#8217;s time or you own with comments he won&#8217;t be able to access or decipher.</p>
<h3>7. Respect the Author&#8217;s Guidelines</h3>
<p>If the author says she&#8217;s only looking for a general overview of the story&#8211;not a line edit&#8211;then respect that. She knows what stage her story is in and what kind of opinion will be most helpful. An unasked for line edit at too early a stage may not only end up wasting your time, but also killing the writer&#8217;s confidence in her story.</p>
<h3>8. Check Your Personal Agenda at the Door</h3>
<p>Remember: as a beta reader, you&#8217;re there to serve the writer, not the other way around. If you have a personal dislike for characters with red hair, the word &#8220;stupendous,&#8221; or rainy scenes, keep it to yourself. There&#8217;s a difference between pet peeves based on technical mistakes and pet peeves that are specific only to us and our personalities.</p>
<h3>9. Identify the Author&#8217;s Vision</h3>
<p>In the same vein as #8, your job is to help the author realize <em>her</em> vision for the story. It&#8217;s definitely not your job to try to impose <em>your</em> vision (or worldview) onto the writer&#8217;s story. If she wrote an adventure story, but you wanted a romance, don&#8217;t take it upon yourself to rewrite the genre. Do your best to figure out what type and tone of story the author is going for, and shape your comments to help her figure out where she&#8217;s falling short of <em>her</em> vision.</p>
<h3>10. Respect the Author&#8217;s Autonomy</h3>
<p>No matter how much effort and time you spend critiquing this story, there is no guarantee the author will make the changes you&#8217;re suggesting. Once you&#8217;ve turned over your critique, let the story go. You&#8217;ve had your say; you&#8217;ve fulfilled your duty. It&#8217;s not your responsibility to talk the writer into using all your suggestions. When the book comes out and the main character still has red hair, resist the urge to throw up your hands in frustration or write the author a scolding email.</p>
<h2>The 8 Rules of Writerly Etiquette in Response to Beta Readers</h2>
<h3>1. Show Gratitude</h3>
<p>Taking the time to read and comment on a manuscript is a <em>humongous</em> favor. Never take that for granted. Even if you should get your manuscript back and end up disagreeing with every single thing the beta reader said, never discount the effort that went into making those comments. Always thank beta readers profusely and let them know you&#8217;re aware of the effort they put into trying to help you.</p>
<h3>2. Don&#8217;t Argue</h3>
<p>Upon reading some (or all) of a beta reader&#8217;s comments, your first instinct might be to argue. But don&#8217;t. Just&#8230; don&#8217;t. If you&#8217;re face to face with a beta reader, simply nod and smile as they explain their thoughts. <em>Only</em> challenge their opinions if you need clarification on a point, and even then make sure you do it with graciousness and humility. No need to let a bossy beta run you over, but try to keep any knee-jerk negative reactions simmered down to a professional, &#8220;That&#8217;s a good point. I&#8217;ll take that into consideration.&#8221;</p>
<h3>3. Don&#8217;t Take Offense</h3>
<p>Yes, you&#8217;ll occasionally run into a nasty beta reader with a personal axe to grind. But generally speaking, most betas aren&#8217;t out to get you&#8211;even when they may sound less than kind in their critiques. Give your betas the benefit of the doubt and assume they just want to help you. Even if they&#8217;re dead wrong about your story, don&#8217;t take offense. This isn&#8217;t personal. It&#8217;s business.</p>
<h3>4. Give the Edit Some Time</h3>
<p>Most of us need a little time to process a critique&#8211;especially if it&#8217;s harsher than we expected. Before outright rejecting a beta reader&#8217;s critique, always give yourself a week or so to process the comments. Step away from the manuscript and just let those initial emotions brew for a while. When you&#8217;ve cleared your head, come back to the critique and evaluate the true worth of the beta reader&#8217;s offerings.</p>
<h3>5. Remember the &#8220;Two People Have to Agree&#8221; Rule</h3>
<p>Just as you shouldn&#8217;t outright reject your beta reader&#8217;s offerings, you also shouldn&#8217;t swallow everything a beta says. My personal rule is that &#8220;two people have to agree&#8221; on a change before I&#8217;ll make it. One of those people can be me: if I immediately recognize the worth of a beta&#8217;s suggestion, obviously I&#8217;ll go ahead and make the change. But if I don&#8217;t agree, I&#8217;ll put the comment on the back burner, where it will stay until another beta reader or editor makes the same comment. If that happens, then I know I have to reevaluate my initial gut feeling.</p>
<h3>6. Respect the Reader&#8217;s Time</h3>
<p>The beta reader is giving you the gift of many, many hours of his time. You&#8217;d be paying a professional editor thousands of dollars to be doing what your beta is doing for free (probable discrepancies in knowledge and skill aside). Respect that gift. Don&#8217;t ask beta readers to adhere to impossibly tight schedules, and once you&#8217;ve agreed upon a reasonable deadline, don&#8217;t pester the beta with requests for progress updates. Only after the deadline has come and gone without response from the beta reader should you send him a gentle email, asking if he&#8217;s had time to look at your book. If he hasn&#8217;t, tell him that&#8217;s all right and look elsewhere for another beta.</p>
<h3>7. Don&#8217;t Request Brainstorming Assistance</h3>
<p>A beta reader isn&#8217;t necessarily a brainstorming buddy. Brainstorming requires almost as much time and effort as critiquing, so don&#8217;t assume that just because someone agreed to read your manuscript he&#8217;ll also want to help you name characters and figure out how to fill plot holes. Pointing out the holes was his job; filling them is yours.</p>
<h3>8. Return the Favor</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s an unspoken rule in the writing world that if you receive a critique, you should also be willing to give one. Offer upfront to return the favor, and when that favor gets called in, do your best to promptly, kindly, and professionally fulfill the duties of the beta reader every bit as well as you&#8217;d like to have them fulfilled <em>for</em> you.</p>
<p>The dance between writer and beta reader can sometimes be a tricky one, since not one, but <em>two</em> big, fat, bruisable writer&#8217;s egos are in play. But figuring out the rules of the dance is always worth the effort. Treat your beta readers with kindness and respect, and always critique other writers in the same measure. When it comes to beta reader etiquette, that&#8217;s really the only rule any of us needs to remember.</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: What do you think is the most important rule of beta reader etiquette?</strong></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“I wrote a few children’s books…not on purpose.”&#8211;Steven Wright.</em></p>
<p>It can feel that way sometimes, when I am writing for young adults.  Finding the right voice which speaks to both (Young Adult) YA and adult audiences can prove maddeningly elusive.  But conscious effort to understand your chosen genre and audience, and to speak to them accordingly, can make every difference.</p>
<h2>Understanding Writing for Young Adults: Genre and Audience</h2>
<p>Some insist YA owes its American genesis to Salinger’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316769487/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316769487&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=OUT5TJ43TPMRALS2" target="_blank">Catcher in the Rye</a>; </em>some point back to Twain and Alcott; others have taken to ascribing YA to some works of that Shakespeare fellow. And <a title="Against YA: Read whatever you want. But you should feel embarrassed when what you’re reading was written for children" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2014/06/against_ya_adults_should_be_embarrassed_to_read_children_s_books.html" target="_blank">there are those</a> who take umbrage at the notion that YA even constitutes a legitimate genre.</p>
<p>But Young Adult fiction&#8211;fiction geared, let’s say, toward readers 16-25 (give or take) is as legitimate a genre as any other. To suggest otherwise is an insult to an enthusiastic readership numbering in the millions,<a title="Home &gt; Children's &gt; Industry News  New Study: 55% of YA Books Bought by Adults" href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-industry-news/article/53937-new-study-55-of-ya-books-bought-by-adults.html" target="_blank">more than half of which</a> is comprised of adults. As with any genre, there is good YA and bad. The writer who knows the difference is well-served indeed.</p>
<h2>What Great YA Does for Us</h2>
<p>Great YA makes us <em>feel </em>something. Young adults relate because they are feeling some of those very things. Adults relate too, because at one point in their lives, they felt some of those things too.  I think of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ZUV4TO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007ZUV4TO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=Y2ZHY2GBHVODG372" target="_blank">The Outsiders</a>, </em>which S.E. Hinton penned as a teenager herself, and which I first read as a young teen. It is simple and powerful in its classic YA themes of young love, the perils and pain of socioeconomic divides, and, of course, coming of age.</p>
<p>I concur with Meg Wolitzer who contends that <a title="Look Homeward, Reader: A Not So Young Audience for Young Adult Books" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/fashion/a-not-so-young-audience-for-young-adult-books.html?_r=3" target="_blank">it’s not just a sense of “verisimilitude” in good YA which lures in the adults</a>.  The S.E. Hintons of the world aside, most YA is penned by (and, as we’ve already established, consumed by) adults. They are taking a journey back in time (even if a story is futuristic, it is going back in time in the sense that it is told through the eyes of YA protagonists), and hopefully presenting it in a manner that resonates with YA and adult audiences alike.</p>
<p>Great YA  is every bit as much about the words in which these characters  live—the experiences, milestones, feelings, and conflicts that have them faltering at that precipice between youth and adulthood. Good YA does more than tip its nostalgic cap to those good ‘ol days. The pervasiveness of depression and suicide among teens is a sobering reminder that if something is felt strongly enough, it is a reality, no matter how many well-intended folks assure us it just comes with the territory, or that we’ll outgrow it. Great YA mines this rocky terrain, a place where young adults struggle to find their footing at the nexus of two worlds. There is something powerful in speaking to an audience in a way they understand, in a way that tells them you understand <em>them.</em> Great YA does this. <em> </em>It is a place where hope still lives.</p>
<h2>What Role Do the Language Arts Play in Writing for Young Adults?</h2>
<p>The Lewises, Alcotts, Riordans, and Rowlings of the world make it look easy but for mere mortals such as myself, it can prove an oh-so-elusive balance: writing for young adults in a way that speaks to—but not above—them, while also speaking to—but not below—adults? Perhaps most of Rowling’s magic is conjured in her richly drawn characters and the dark and exhilarating world in which she placed them.  Let’s sample a small bit from chapter one of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00728DY9W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00728DY9W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=NFF3O5IMKXURM6W2" target="_blank">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a>:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table followed Snape, and it was to him that Voldemort spoke first.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“So?”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The interest around the table sharpened palpably.</p>
<p>Unremarkable, but that is my point: there are hundreds of thousands of similar passages I could have excerpted from the series, any one of which flows seamlessly, any one of which simply <em>works.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The two men took their allotted places. </em></p>
<p><em>Allotted</em>. No big thing, and yet, everything. Word choice matters.</p>
<p>Rowling might have gone with: <em>designated</em>, <em>assigned</em>, <em>given</em>. And each of those would have been fine. But <em>allotted</em> catches my eye because I have seen words like that questioned in YA work. As in, do teens really talk like that?</p>
<p>I push back just a little against such litmus tests, commonly tendered though they are. I do not always subscribe to the notion that the voice of a third-person narrator must always equate identically with that of the protagonist. It best not deviate wildly, but what is important in this consideration is a narrative voice that reconciles ably with the age, voice and world of the protag. I have faith in young readers, and also do not wish to alienate adults with oversimplified language.</p>
<p>As with anything, the pendulum can swing to an extreme, and must be re-centered. Those who tend toward the other extreme—who in their justifiable fear of losing young readers by sending them scrambling endlessly to the (probably online) dictionary&#8211;risk reducing things to painfully rudimentary levels.</p>
<p>Balance, my friends. Balance.</p>
<p>Let’s briefly revisit the Potter passage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The interest around the table sharpened palpably. </em></p>
<p>Palpably. Let’s try this again: do most teens speak in this manner? Not many. Rowling could have perhaps opted for <em>noticeably, </em>or <em>visibly.</em> But palpably sticks a little better, singes the meaning a bit more hotly onto the page. If some young readers need to look it up, so be it.</p>
<h2>When all’s said and done…</h2>
<p>If you love YA then keep on reading it (here is but one of <a title="Ya Book Lists" href="http://www.goodreads.com/list/tag/ya" target="_blank">many YA lists you could consult</a>), and if you love writing for young adults, keep on doing that too.</p>
<p>Stay focused on your target: target genre, target audience.</p>
<p>Your weapons of choice are: story, character, language, voice.</p>
<p>And if you are guided by a commitment to speak authentically to your readership, your aim shall be true</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: Do you enjoy YA, or do you agree with some of its critics? What additional traits should be stressed in writing for young adults? What are some of your favorite works?</strong></h3>

We&#8217;ve all battled writer&#8217;s block from time to time, and, brother, it ain&#8217;t very much fun. So what if I told you I knew a way to beat writer&#8217;s block 99.9% of the time?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple, really. All you have to do is <strong>create a lifestyle that nurtures creativity</strong>. When you learn how to fuel your mental, emotional, and inspiration tanks throughout the day, you&#8217;ll never run dry when it&#8217;s time to sit down and write.</p>
<p>But as you&#8217;ve no doubt discovered: <strong>that can be easier said than done.</strong></p>
<p>Life has the totally endearing quality of derailing even the best of our plans, and as a writer, that can lead you to some serious episodes of banging your head against your keyboard when the words just refuse to come. It&#8217;s funny (or maybe not) that some of the most popular #YouKnowYouAreAWriterWhen tags I share on Facebook and Twitter are the ones about writer&#8217;s block:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the common myths about a story&#8217;s theme is that it must also be the story&#8217;s &#8220;moral&#8221; or &#8220;message.&#8221; Because theme always deals with fundamental truths that inevitably affect human morality, it&#8217;s easy to assume a story&#8217;s theme must always be specific and applicable to the readers.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t necessarily a false assumption. As we&#8217;ve discussed in previous posts, <a title="Want a Powerful Theme for Your Novel? Play Devil’s Advocate!" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/11/powerful-theme-2.html" target="_blank">theme <em>is</em> about raising questions and suggesting answers</a> that make people think about how to live their lives more honestly and, even, morally. However, there is a major problem with the assumption that theme is a didactic message, designed to <em>teach</em> people how to <em>specifically</em> enact the thematic principle in their own lives.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Think about it this way. If we create stories that <em>tell</em> people how to put the theme to work in their own, very individual lives, then we&#8217;re going to have to be writing story situations that apply to the vast majority of humans. Right away, you can see how such a story must become frustratingly vague (and boring). Worse, amidst all that vagueness, it&#8217;s pretty hard to hide your moralizing intent.</p>
<p>In middle school, I had to read stories about a group of kids who did generic, kid-like things (mowing the lawn, finding money, attending birthday parties). Every story ended with the kids learning some important lesson. The problem (which is still vivid in my mind all these years later) was that this approach&#8211;however spot-on in its intent&#8211;was more about the story&#8217;s <em>message</em> than its theme.</p>
<h2>The Difference Between Your Story&#8217;s Theme and Its Message</h2>
<p>So what&#8217;s the difference? Let&#8217;s make this easy:</p>
<p><strong>Theme is a general principle. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Message is a specific example of that theme in action.</strong></p>
<p>(And, yeah, I know I said the problem with a story&#8217;s message is that it was <em>vague</em>, not specific, but I&#8217;ll explain that in a sec.)</p>
<p>Theme is big stuff. Theme is justice and mercy. Theme is do unto thy neighbor. Theme is joy, peace, and love.</p>
<p><em>Message</em>, on the other hand, is found in the specific story situations that <em>illustrate</em> the thematic principles. Your message is your story’s theme in action.</p>
<p>When your character is working through his character arc, <a title="Creating Stunning Character Arcs, Pt. 2: The Lie Your Character Believes" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/02/character-arcs-2.html" target="_blank">headed away from his Lie and toward the new Truth of the theme</a>, the plot events that act upon him and force him to take action are where we find the message. The very specificity of these story situations (just like those we encounter in real life) means whatever aspect of the theme the character is encountering in that moment is probably just a tiny piece of it. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y26XXA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002Y26XXA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=RGY5KCZDID3HYAQ6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Dramatica</em></a>, Melanie Anne Phillips and Chris Huntley explain:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;we know that characters often work not toward the real solution but to a perceived solution. And characters frequently grapple with a problem that is ultimately recognized as only a symptom of the real problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>If your theme is justice and mercy, then your story&#8217;s message will probably be something much smaller and more specific to your characters, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I8V0Q8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004I8V0Q8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=A2VZWQDRXUJA3KJY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mattie Ross</a>&#8216;s &#8220;justice is worth having, even if you must chase it down at the risk of your own life.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Robert-Duvall-Kim-Darby-True-Grit-Henry-Hathaway-1969.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7969 aligncenter" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Robert-Duvall-Kim-Darby-True-Grit-Henry-Hathaway-1969.jpg" alt="Robert Duvall (Ned Pepper)  and his gang capture Kim Darby (Mattie Ross), and he forces Cogburn and Le Boeuf to abandon the girl." width="478" height="268" /></a></p>
<h2>Theme Is Inclusive, Message Is Exclusive</h2>
<p>The most important difference to understand about theme and message is that theme is <em>inclusive</em> and message is <em>exclusive</em>. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C2C8XSU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00C2C8XSU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=E7DBIQMCHTMSXTOM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Writing Screenplays That Sell</em></a>, Michael Hauge posits:</p>
<blockquote><p>Theme is also not the same as message. A <em>message</em>, by my definition, is a political statement. It is a principle that concerns people in a particular situation and is not universally applicable to any member of the audience.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, theme applies to everyone; message applies only to the characters and their specific situation. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00170F0DE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00170F0DE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=H4A5CREJY5Y2BXJA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Spider-Man</em></a>, the theme is &#8220;with great power comes great responsibility,&#8221; but the message is that responsibility means donning spandex and fighting bad guys. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I9YV2Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000I9YV2Q&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=PNGWED3TBFIKW3FD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Spider-Man 2</em></a>, the theme is that we all have the potential to be heroic, but the message is that, in order to be heroic, &#8221; you have to be steady and give up the thing you want the most.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think we can all agree &#8220;with great power comes great responsibility&#8221; is a universal truth. It applies to you, me, and Kim Jong Un just as much as it does Spidey. But whatever power we may possess, it&#8217;s unlikely we&#8217;re going to exercise our responsibility for it by becoming hooded vigilantes. The story&#8217;s <em>message</em> is too specific to apply to us or most other viewers: it&#8217;s exclusive to people bitten by radioactive spiders.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Tobey-Maguire-Spider-Man-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7970" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Tobey-Maguire-Spider-Man-2.jpg" alt="Tobey Maguire Spider-Man 2" width="420" height="315" /></a></p>
<p>But the theme? Ah, yes, that&#8217;s inclusive. It applies to all of us&#8211;and that&#8217;s why audiences resonated so strongly with what might otherwise have been nothing but a story about a human spider in tights.</p>
<h2>If Message Is So Specific, How Come I Said It Will Create a Vague Story?</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the post, I talked about how the problem with stories that focus on <em>message</em> rather than <em>theme</em> is that they end up too vague. But how does that work if message is <em>more</em> specific than theme?</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t with message in general. You <em>want</em> your story to have a message. You can&#8217;t have a theme without a message, since your message is the vehicle on which your story&#8217;s theme will reach your readers.</p>
<p>The problem is when you try to make your message <em>into </em>your theme.</p>
<p>Remember those middle-grade stories I talked about? The message and the theme were exactly the same: Billy found some money, wanted to keep it, then realized the right thing to do would be to find the owner and give it back. It&#8217;s a message that applies to kids everywhere, not just Billy. The message isn&#8217;t <em>more</em> specific than its theme; it <em>is</em> the theme. The result is a message that&#8217;s too on the nose to avoid moralizing, and a story situation that&#8217;s too vague to create any real curiosity or interest in readers.</p>
<h2>How Do You Find the Right Message for Your Story&#8217;s Theme?</h2>
<p><a title="Don’t Know Your Story’s Theme? Take a Look at Your Character’s Arc" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/11/storys-theme.html" target="_blank">Chances are your theme will arise out of your message rather than the other way around.</a> Most stories start with their characters stuck in a situation, rather than with a theme that then needs a situation to illustrate it.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s important to remember is that the two are integrally linked. The theme creates the message&#8211;or vice versa. Whatever your story&#8217;s <em>exclusive</em> message is, it must be an illustration of your <em>inclusive</em> theme. When Phillips and Huntley tell us &#8220;theme will not be a universal meaning for all things, but a smaller truth pertaining to the proper way of dealing with a particular situation,&#8221; that &#8220;smaller truth&#8221; they&#8217;re talking about is the message.</p>
<p>Consider a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KSW5WI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005KSW5WI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=JWKR5GU3RIWSCTHM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Secondhand Lions</em></a>&#8216; <strong>theme</strong> is having faith in people. Its <strong>message</strong> is that sometimes it&#8217;s better to believe in things because they&#8217;re worth believing in, rather than because they&#8217;re actually true.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LLOOSWA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00LLOOSWA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=IKX6W327T5XCUC7M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Jane Eyre</em></a>&#8216;s <strong>theme</strong> is self-worth. Its <strong>message</strong> is that even a great love isn&#8217;t worth enslaving your soul.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC0SH8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000FC0SH8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=ZIGA2HDOG3X4DRRJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>The Old Man and the Sea</em></a>&#8216;s <strong>theme</strong> is that courage and endurance are their own reward. Its <strong>message</strong> is that trying and failing to bring in a giant swordfish will be more validating than giving up a losing fight.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Second-Hand-Lions-Jane-Eyre-Old-Man-and-the-Sea.png" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7972" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Second-Hand-Lions-Jane-Eyre-Old-Man-and-the-Sea.png" alt="Second Hand Lions Jane Eyre Old Man and the Sea" width="600" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Only once you&#8217;ve identified your story&#8217;s message can you use it to bring to life your story&#8217;s theme in the most powerful, integrated, and subtextual way possible. Put the two together, and you&#8217;ll have a powerhouse story that will avoid all the common myths about theme as the &#8220;moral of the story.&#8221; Try it out!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All creative writers must strike that terrible balance between the needs of the characters and the needs of the plot. It’s a wretched ping-pong game sometimes, and we can feel as if one will win over the other. But deep down we know it shouldn’t be that way. <a title="Plot vs. Character: Which Is More Important?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2010/02/plot-vs-character-which-is-more.html" target="_blank">The elements of character and plot are not in competition</a> with each other. Each have their own needs and until we realize that fact, the struggle will go on. Let&#8217;s examine the secret to harmonizing character and plot&#8211;by writing a protagonist who&#8217;s both unique and universal.</p>
<h2>Characters Are Individual</h2>
<p>Few things are worse that two-dimensional characters. If there is nothing interesting about the people in your stories, it doesn’t matter how dynamite your plots are. If your people are boring, it is inevitable your writing will be as well.</p>
<p>Your characters are at their best when they are as unique as possible. They have physical quirks, as well as psychological. They have <a title="Most Common Writing Mistakes: Weak Character Voice" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/12/common-mistakes-one-symptom-weak-character-voice.html" target="_blank">a particular vocabulary and speech pattern</a>. Each and every character has a well-defined worldview and a <a title="Why Your Character’s Motive Matters" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2010/07/why-your-characters-motive-matters.html" target="_blank">personal motivation for their actions</a>. Everything about them is as detailed and finely tuned as possible.</p>
<h2>Stories Are Universal</h2>
<p>In contrast to your &#8220;narrow&#8221; characters, stories need to be as broad as humanity. In particular, I have in mind theme. <a title="Want a Powerful Theme for Your Novel? Play Devil’s Advocate!" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/11/powerful-theme-2.html" target="_blank">The theme is <em>why</em> we are writing our particular stories.</a> Themes within a given tale can be about such things as sacrificing one’s self for a greater good, perseverance in the face or failure and defeat, or the short-term value of beauty or wealth.</p>
<p>Your characters should be as individual as snowflakes, but the themes of your stories need to be as absolute as the snowstorm.</p>
<h2>There Is Only One Story</h2>
<p>Allow me to let you in on a little secret that all creative writers should know: there is only one story.</p>
<p>That one story is about what it is like to live as a human in this world.</p>
<p>Just as all people are different, all people are just the same. We all have the same struggles and obstacles in life. we share the same joys and pleasures in this world. If your stories do not  tap into these shared struggles and joys, readers will not find a connection to your work.</p>
<p>The best stories are those with interesting people doing interesting things. To write such a story, you need well-written characters and meaningful plots. You need characters and stories that are not in conflict with each other, but that complement each other. Each have their own needs. If your characters are as unique and particular as they can be, and if your stories are as real and human as they can be, you will end up with a compelling tale readers will cherish.</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: How do you go about writing a protagonist to make him both relatable and interesting?</strong></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year, I find myself reading with the maniac intensity of someone who believes it might be the last reading year. (I like to turn everything into an extreme sport.) After all, what self-respecting writer doesn&#8217;t study at the feet of the masters as much as she can? I had so much fun sharing <a title="Top Books of 2013" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/12/top-20-books-2013.html" target="_blank">my top books from last year</a> that I couldn&#8217;t wait to do it again. So, without further ado, here are my top books of 2014.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best character development is often found in the heart of his personal narrative: his introspective observations and reactions to the events of the story. As I&#8217;ve preached many a time, if a character&#8217;s not <em>reacting </em>to what&#8217;s happening in your story, then what&#8217;s happening doesn&#8217;t matter. But the irony here is that the eternal balancing act of the writer leads us to yet another of the most common writing mistakes: too <em>much</em> introspection.</p>

The ability to get inside a character&#8217;s head and see the world from his unique viewpoint is what brings life to great stories&#8211;everything from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316769487/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316769487&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=UBFB4DY4INPGM54W" target="_blank"><em>Catcher in the Rye</em></a> to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I8V0Q8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004I8V0Q8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=RANXK2OBU7C2RLOV" target="_blank"><em>True Grit</em></a> to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QTE9WU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000QTE9WU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=UWBRCG5E3L6XZZXI" target="_blank"><i>Poisonwood Bible</i></a>.

<p>But introspection can never take the place of interaction. When you end up with characters doing more observing than acting, that&#8217;s often (although definitely not always) a sign <a title="Most Common Writing Mistakes: Are You Skipping the Best Parts?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2012/10/most-common-writing-mistakes-18.html" target="_blank">you&#8217;re avoiding the best parts of your story</a>.</p>
<h2>How to Bore Readers With Too Much Introspection</h2>
<p>There you are, writing an epic romance&#8211;the relationship story of all relationship stories. Your hero and heroine are super-duper charming and fascinating. Their chemistry zings right off the page. Your readers can&#8217;t <em>wait </em>for them to get together. But, first, naturally, comes the part where they have to work through all their reasons for <em>not</em> being together. Conflict and obstacles ensue. Otherwise, the story ends, right?</p>
<p>So you figure your characters better do a lot of thinking about this possible new romance of theirs. After all, there <em>is</em> a lot to think about. They&#8217;ve both got <a title="Improve Your Character Instantly: Just Add a Ghost" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/10/improve-your-character-instantly-just.html" target="_blank">backstory baggage</a> to work through, fears to overcome, and, of course, doubts about whether or not the other person returns their feelings. If you don&#8217;t logic through all this stuff, then readers won&#8217;t feel the progression of the relationship, and <a title="How Authors Kill Suspension of Disbelief by Calling Attention to Themselves" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/12/authors-kill-suspension-of-disbelief.html" target="_blank">their suspension of disbelief might be endangered</a>.</p>
<p>So you have Mr. Hero ponder everything happening to him:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Romeo stood in the stable door and watched Juliet feeding the chickens. Gosh, but she was beautiful. That glorious golden hair. Those huge violet eyes. He thumped his fist against his heart. But, alas, who was he but a poor servant boy&#8211;and wanted by the law to boot.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Juliet peeked up at him from under the lavender kerchief that tied back her hair. She batted her eyes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">His heart flipped over in his chest. If only&#8211;! But, no, he could never endanger her chances for a better match or put her in the way of his enemies. He would have to hold his peace and keep his great love to himself. He went back to mucking out the stalls.</p>

<h2>How to Rivet Readers With the Right Amount of Character Interaction</h2>
<p>Right about now, I&#8217;m wanting to grab Romeo by his ruffed collar and tell to stop wasting my time with his mooning. His attraction to Juliet is important info, and his concerns about the feasibility of their relationship do him credit. But frankly, I don&#8217;t care. I get the picture already! Let&#8217;s get down to the good stuff, shall we? You know&#8211;the talking, the flirting, the arguing, the occasional face slapping, the <em>interaction</em>.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, most good stories are going to be <a title="It’s What Your Characters Do That Defines Them" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2009/08/its-what-your-characters-do-that.html" target="_blank">about characters <em>doing</em> something</a>. Most readers would rather it be sooner than later. By the third time the character <em>thinks</em> about talking to the other character, readers are going to want to skip ahead to the part where the talking actually starts happening.</p>
<p>Largely, the cure for this thirty-sixth of our most common writing mistakes harks back to one of my favorite bits of writing advice: &#8220;<a title="Skip the Boring Parts" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2010/08/skip-boring-parts.html" target="_blank">Skip the boring parts!</a>&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/USE-UP.png"><img class="wp-image-7846 aligncenter" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/USE-UP.png" alt="I try to leave out the parts people skip Elmer Leonard" width="410" height="410" /></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s give Romeo a second chance shall we?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Romeo stood in the stable door and watched Juliet feeding the chickens. &#8220;Gosh, but you&#8217;re&#8211;&#8221; <em>Beautiful</em>. He wanted to tell her she was beautiful. But, no, that would lead them both places he couldn&#8217;t let them go.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">She straightened and stared him in the eye. &#8220;Gosh, but I&#8217;m <em>what?</em>&#8220;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He cleared his throat. &#8220;Late. Those chickens have been squawking for hours.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;That is <em>not</em> what you were going to say.&#8221; She sauntered over. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just tell me the truth for once?&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;I&#8217;d like to&#8211;but I can&#8217;t.&#8221; The truth would get them both killed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Was that disappointment that flickered across her face?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nope, she tilted that pert nose to the sky. &#8220;You&#8217;re right. You&#8217;re just a stable boy. You shouldn&#8217;t even be talking to me.&#8221; She spun on her heel and stomped back past the chickens.</p>
<p>Ahhh, that&#8217;s much more interesting. Not only did we get to skip that fat lot of <em>nothing</em> happening in the first example, but, in its place, we got to add conflict, dialogue, subtext, and some juicy hints about our character&#8217;s past and motivations. What&#8217;s not to like?</p>
<h2>When You <em>Should</em> Use Introspection</h2>
<p>Naturally, I&#8217;ve got to add a caveat in here. Don&#8217;t take Romeo&#8217;s misadventures as a warning against <em>all</em> introspection/character thoughts/internal monologues/narrative. Narrative is a crucial part of any story. It <em>is</em> vital to character development and advancing the causality and <a title="How Much Realism Does Your Novel REALLY Need?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/11/much-realism-novel-really-need.html" target="_blank">realism of your story</a>. Very likely, Romeo&#8217;s original line of thinking would fit into the right story without ever slowing readers down.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also true some stories are <em>meant</em> to be more introspective than active. Many a literary classic is all about the character&#8217;s thoughts rather than his actions. But for most popular novels, you&#8217;re going to want to make sure you&#8217;ve properly balanced the two.</p>
<p>Consider your work-in-progress. Is your character thinking about what he should do more than he&#8217;s doing it? Are there lengthy passages in which he&#8217;s going over (and over and over) things in his mind, <a title="The Cure-All for Long and Boring Narrative" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2011/08/cure-all-for-long-and-boring-narrative.html" target="_blank">rather than discussing them with another character</a>, or simply working them out as he goes? It&#8217;s possible these introspection-heavy scenes of yours are just fine as they are. But it&#8217;s also possible you might double your literary investment by lighting a fire under your character and forcing him into action.</p>
<h3> <strong>Tell me your opinion: How have you balanced your narrator&#8217;s introspection with his interaction?</strong></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently found myself in the &#8220;writing&#8221; subreddit, offering my two cents in the discussion. One of the questions that seemed to ring a bell with a few writers was, “<em>Why can’t I bring myself to edit?”</em> Writing seemed to be the easy part. Editing your book? Not so much.</p>
<p>Here at <a title="CompletelyNovel" href="http://completelynovel.com/" target="_blank">CompletelyNovel</a>, we find that editing makes all the difference when publishing a book. It’s what puts your work in the same league as the books on your bookshelf. If you dread editing, it can help to think of it in the same way as you do your writing. Both writing and editing are as much about creativity as they are about discipline and planning.</p>
<p>Below are some of the top tips I’ve picked up to manage and, dare I say it, even make editing enjoyable!</p>
<h2>1. Set Yourself Targets for Writing and Editing Your Book</h2>
<p>Rather than steaming straight into editing, spend some time planning. <a title="The Ridiculously Surefire Way to Write the Perfect Novel" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2008/07/making-of-perfect-novel.html" target="_blank">Take lessons from your writing routine</a>.</p>
<p>Do you prefer to write in the morning, or in the evening?</p>
<p>Do you need solitude, or can you freely scribble away in a noisy café?</p>
<p>You may set yourself a word limit to reach each day. Setting achievable goals keep you motivated to put pen to paper. A thousand words you’re not proud of is better than no words at all, after all.</p>
<p>You can use the same ideas to plan your editing. Again, consider the way you write.</p>
<p>Do you find that you run out of steam quickly? Then you might find it useful to schedule in an editing day after several days of writing.</p>
<p>Or maybe you prefer to write the whole thing first and edit after? That’s okay, just remember to break your editing into achievable goals like you did your writing. Editing a thousand words a day sounds much more doable than editing the entire novel.</p>
<h2>2. Understand Editing Your Book Comes in Different Forms</h2>
<p>There are three well-known stages of editing:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1.</strong> Structural.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2.</strong> Copyediting.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3.</strong> Proofreading.</p>
<p>Each is equally important, and they work best in that order.</p>
<h3>Structural Editing</h3>
<p>Our <a title="Get Your Book Fit" href="https://www.udemy.com/get-your-book-fit/?couponCode=GYBF15" target="_blank">Get Your Book Fit</a> sums up structural editing really well. Structural editing focuses on the basic elements of storytelling, things such as narrative drive, <a title="5 Ways to Pace Your Story" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2009/07/5-ways-to-pace-your-story.html" target="_blank">pacing</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EJX08QA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00EJX08QA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20" target="_blank">structure</a>, and <a title="3 Ways to Make Your POVs Equally Interesting" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/03/3-ways-to-make-your-povs-equally.html" target="_blank">point of view</a>.</p>
<h3>Copyediting</h3>
<p>Copyediting on the other hand, is about polishing the surface: correcting mistakes in <a title="Most Common Writing Mistakes: 10 Stylistic Mistakes Sabotaging Your Story" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2011/08/most-common-mistakes-series-10.html" target="_blank">usage</a>, continuity, <a title="Are You Guilty of These 8 Common Grammar Mistakes?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2011/02/guilty-8-common-grammar-mistakes.html" target="_blank">grammar</a>, and style.</p>
<h3>Proofreading</h3>
<p>Proofreading is the very last stage of editing&#8211;<a title="Never Miss a Typo Again" href="http://authorculture.blogspot.com/2010/02/never-miss-typo-again.html" target="_blank">identifying and correcting all the remaining errors</a>. There’s no use spending months correcting typos only to realize you need to rewrite half the book for it to make sense structurally, after all!</p>
<h2>3. Edit With Fresh Perspective</h2>
<p>Don’t underestimate the importance of giving your mind a rest between writing and editing. Stephen King famously leaves six weeks between writing and editing his manuscript. Again, how much time you need depends on how you work. Some writers take a few days and some take a few weeks.</p>
<h2>4. Improve Your Line Editing</h2>
<p>This can be a bit time consuming, but rest assured it is time well invested. Separate your sentences and think about whether each of them makes sense both on its own and within a wider context. Look closely at <a title="5 Key Ways to Choose the Right Word (Without a Thesaurus!)" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/11/5-key-ways-to-choose-the-right-word.html" target="_blank">your choice of words</a> and get rid of any phrases or words that are unnecessary or cliché.</p>
<p>I’ve found line editing is easier on a computer. Isolate every sentence on a separate line and use double spacing so you can clearly see the length and pacing of each sentence. Read the sentence out loud to discover how it flows and whether any words are jarring.</p>
<h2>5. Print Your Manuscript</h2>
<p>No, I’m not going to tell you off for preferring screen to paper, but printing a draft of your novel can be a useful process for spotting further mistakes. Words look different on a printed page. Plus, it’s nice to give your eyes a break. Shut down the computer, do some eye yoga (yes, really), and embrace that red pen as your best friend.</p>
<p>Remember, no book was ever published without editing. Sit back, unleash the red pen, cram your mouth full of cake, and enjoy yourself. Your book will be all the better for it!</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: What is your greatest challenge in editing your book?</strong></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the thing about a powerful theme. It&#8217;s not black and white. It&#8217;s not the moral of the story. It&#8217;s not an answer&#8211;it&#8217;s a question. And here&#8217;s the thing about questions: they very often have more than one answer.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re writing a story that asks a simple little question like, &#8220;Is lying bad?&#8221; That seems pretty black and white, yeah? But what about when the Mafia hitman walks up to your door and asks if your debt-ridden old man is home? He&#8217;s in the living room hiding under the coffee table, hyperventilating. But you look Mr. Hitman in the eye and swear up and down that Dad moved to Cali. Was that down-and-dirty lie a bad thing?</p>
<p>Truth isn&#8217;t subjective, but our individual takes on it are and its applicability in varying situations definitely is. As the Chinese proverb says,</p>
<blockquote><p>There are three truths. My truth, your truth, and the truth.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re ever going to write a compelling theme (and, by extension, a compelling story), this is the <em>one</em> principle of storytelling you have to realize. You can&#8217;t present readers with <em>your</em> truth straight up and <a title="How to Send a Message in Your Story… Without Preaching" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/05/message-in-your-story.html" target="_blank">expect them to not feel preached at</a>&#8211;much less swallow it for themselves.</p>
<h2>The Idea of Theme Makes Some Authors Uncomfortable&#8211;This Is Why</h2>
<p>Within some writing circles, theme has something of a bad name. Writers wrinkle their noses at the word, as if it&#8217;s kind of smelly. Theme is <em>preachy</em>. Theme is what Aesop&#8217;s fables give us. Theme is about evangelizing readers to a specific viewpoint&#8211;and readers <em>hate</em> that.</p>
<p>And yet writers are also told (like I&#8217;ve been telling you these last few weeks) that <a title="Don’t Know Your Story’s Theme? Take a Look at Your Character’s Arc" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/11/storys-theme.html" target="_blank">a powerful theme is crucial to a successful story</a>. So&#8217;s how that work?</p>
<p>The key, of course, is the word &#8220;powerful.&#8221; We only get a powerful theme when we understand that preaching actually weakens theme. Claiming a rock-solid viewpoint and screaming it in the readers&#8217; faces <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> equal a powerful theme. It&#8217;s very unmoveableness is what weakens it. Theme isn&#8217;t the brittle rock in the middle of the river: it&#8217;s the water that keeps on moving, always searching.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/FOLLOW.png"><img class=" wp-image-7771 aligncenter" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/FOLLOW.png" alt="Be water, my friend. Bruce Lee Quote" width="366" height="366" /></a></p>
<p>But then that sounds kinda wishy-washy, doesn&#8217;t it? How do you present a solid theme <em>without</em> standing behind your moral viewpoint 100%?</p>
<h2>Point and Counterpoint: Convince Readers of Your Theme by <em>Not</em> Convincing Them</h2>
<p>If your purpose of writing a novel is to convince readers of <em>your</em> truth, then you&#8217;re probably working in the wrong medium. Better buy a podium or a pulpit (or a blog!). But if you&#8217;re interested in <em>sharing</em> your truth and raising interesting questions about it, then you&#8217;re in the right place.</p>
<p>Theme is about exploration. But you can&#8217;t explore unless you&#8217;re willing to step out of the tour bus and visit some dark places. In other words, you have to be willing to look at the exact opposite of your theme&#8217;s posited truth and explore it just as earnestly and honestly as if you believed it. For every point you raise to support the thematic premise you&#8217;ve chosen, you&#8217;ll have to raise an equally honest and probing counterpoint. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y26XXA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002Y26XXA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=4Y43IRBIMWA3YURZ" target="_blank"><em>Dramatica</em></a>, <span class="a-size-small a-color-secondary">Melanie Anne Phillips and </span><span class="a-size-small a-color-secondary">Chris Huntley explain:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y26XXA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002Y26XXA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=N47R7WSRWHT42FXZ" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-7770 size-medium" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Dramatica-Melanie-Anne-Phillips-Chris-Huntley-210x300.jpg" alt="Dramatica Melanie Anne Phillips Chris Huntley" width="210" height="300" /></a>Both Issue and counterpoint must be played against one another over the course of the story if the author is to make a case that one is better than the other.</p></blockquote>
<p>Favoritism has no place in a powerful theme. Why? Because your readers will sniff it out in a second and instinctively discount your truth a little bit, both because you&#8217;re obviously prejudiced in presenting it and because they don&#8217;t appreciate your attempts to manipulate them. Robert McKee, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042FZVOY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0042FZVOY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=XW4CFZRWD2GIRJGY" target="_blank"><em>Story</em></a>, hammers it home:</p>
<blockquote><p>In creating the dimensions of your story’s [thematic] “argument,” take great care to build the power of both sides. Compose the scenes and sequences that contradict your final statement with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it. If your [story] ends on the Counter-Idea, such as “Crime pays because…,” then amplify the sequences that lead the audience to feel justice will win out. If your [story] ends on the Idea, such as “Justice triumphs because…,” then enhance the sequences expressing “Crime pays and pays big.” In other words, do not slant your “argument.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Your Powerful Theme Will Arise From Your Ability to See Both Sides</h2>
<p>Some stories will come to you complete with a strong thematic idea. The whole story is <em>about</em> why lying is bad. Your passion about this truth is why you&#8217;re writing this story in the first place. As a result, the idea that you have to explore why lying might <em>not</em> be so bad turns your stomach. McKee again:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042FZVOY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0042FZVOY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=XW4CFZRWD2GIRJGY" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-7172 size-medium" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/robert-mckee-story-200x300.jpg" alt="Story by Robert McKee" width="200" height="300" /></a>As a story develops, you must willingly entertain opposite, even repugnant ideas. The finest writers have dialectical, flexible minds that easily shift points of view. They see the positive, the negative, and all shades of irony, seeking the truth of these views honestly and convincingly. This omniscience forces them to become even more creative, more imaginative, and more insightful.</p></blockquote>
<p>I like to say that if you&#8217;re not <a title="Why You Should Be Writing Scared" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2009/10/why-you-should-be-writing-scared-2.html" target="_blank">writing scared</a>, you&#8217;re not realizing your story&#8217;s full potential&#8211;and this is nowhere more true than of theme. Authors can&#8217;t be complacent. If you&#8217;re unwilling to explore the dark sides of the truths you profess to believe, then you may want to question how strongly you actually believe them. If a theme is true, then its truth will be able to stand stalwartly under even the strongest scrutiny. Even better, it will emerge all the stronger in both your own mind and that of your readers.</p>
<p>Consider every possible objection even the most virulent readers might raise to your thematic premise. Every one of these objections needs to be raised by your characters&#8211;and not just the &#8220;bad&#8221; characters, but the protagonist himself. Take your protagonist down the dark side of your theme and see what you find. Be brutal. Be honest. You, your characters, and your readers will all emerge on the other side having gained more than mere entertainment. For the rest of your lives, you&#8217;ll all carry the things you&#8217;ve learned about this powerful theme.</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: How have you presented a powerful theme by also honestly demonstrating its flip side?</strong></h3>
