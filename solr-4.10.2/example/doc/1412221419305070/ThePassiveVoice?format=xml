				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the Attention Deficit Disorder Association:</p>
<blockquote><p>Another ADHD myth exposed to the glare of scientific study! Only this time, research confirms what many have long maintained. People with ADHD are more creative.</p>
<p>Holly A. White from the University of Memphis and Priti Shah of the University of Michigan published an ADHD and creativity study this month showing, &#8220;adults with ADHD showed higher levels of original creative thinking … and higher levels of real-world creative achievement, compared to adults without ADHD.&#8221; They also found that faced with a problem, most people prefer to study the problem or refine ideas, whereas we ADHDers prefer to generate new ideas … brainstorming (what most people call daydreaming!)</p>
<p>I had always suspected some of us were more creative! An informal survey of friends in the entertainment industry reveals at least a third and maybe half qualify as ADHD.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>But this new study is a double-edged sword. For ADHDers struggling with finances, relationships and work, it’s a relief to hear about the positive side to a mind that flutters out of control. For ADHDers with some mastery over their symptoms, it confirms that a mind that doesn’t filter incoming signals as well as most people’s can be an asset in certain situations. However, for ADHDers who are not creative, this could be taken as yet another failure, as in, &#8220;Wow, I can’t even do ADHD right!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Medical Daily:</p>
<blockquote><p>As if you didn’t need another reason to drink, creative agency CP+B Copenhagen just teamed up with Danish brewery Rocket Brewing to design a beer that will boost your creativity. After all, it’s often while relaxing at a bar, drinking a pint, that we find ourselves thinking more creatively about the tasks at hand — whether at work, at home, or elsewhere.</p>
<p>The beer, a 7.1 percent-alcohol by volume India Pale Ale is called “The Problem Solver.” Its bottle design is based on research from University of Illinois Professor Jennifer Wiley, who determined that a person’s “creative peak” comes when they reach a blood alcohol level of 0.075. So, in order to get people as close to this level as possible, the bottle includes a scale, which shows creativity-searching drinkers where to stop drinking, based on their weight.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>“We have often experienced that the best creative ideas, that we have come up with, are not necessarily done within the agency walls, but often at after-hours social gatherings at our local pub,” CP+B Copenhagen managing director Mathias Birkvad told Fast Company. “As an ad agency, we believe that creative thinking can solve any problem. So why not take the idea a step further and use the beer to do something good?”</p></blockquote>

<p>PG can attest that 99% of the advertising agency types he used to work with held a strong belief that alcohol enhanced all aspects of their lives.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Anne R. Allen&#8217;s Blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>Plot is story; story is plot. Without something happening, your characters aren’t pushed to grow and you can’t show their carefully crafted complexities.</p>
<p>With a well-formed plot, you pull in the reader with flawless tension handling, robust arcs, and vibrant themes.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>1. Structure is required in all of art. Dancing, painting, singing, you name it–all art forms require structure. Writing is no different. To bring a story to its full potential, authors must understand the form’s limitations, as well as put its many parts into proper order to achieve maximum effect.</p>
<p>K.M. Weiland, Structuring Your Novel</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>5. The fix for most script problems is to give serious attention to the movement from one narrative moment to the next. The easiest way to understand what a narrative moment is, is to ask two questions: What does this action or this line of dialogue force the audience to question? How does that information relate to previous questions raised by the story?</p>
<p>Clive Davies-Frayne, Why I Don’t Read “How To” Screenwriting Articles Anymore</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>7. Plotting with mini arcs can be a handy tool to break your novel into smaller, more manageable pieces that keep the story moving and the ideas coming.</p>
<p>Janice Hardy, Plot Your Novel With Mini Arcs<br />
8. As you are working out the plot for your book (or, for you pantsers, as you are trying to figure out what happens next,) make a list of all the things that could happen next.</p>
<p>Kara Lennox, The Plot Fixer #8 – Is Your Plot Too Predictible?</p>
<p>9. Make coincidences add complications, not take them away.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From The Digital Reader:</p>
<blockquote><p>Noted author and firebrand JA Konrath was one of the first indie authors recruited by Amazon to join KDP Select when it launched with Kindle Owner&#8217;s Lending Library in late 2011 and now he&#8217;s the latest high profile indie author to make an exit.<span id="more-77495"></span></p>
<p>Konrath revealed on his blog today that he&#8217;s in the process of pulling his titles from KDP Select, which supplies indie ebooks to both Kindle Unlimited and KOLL. He made the decision a few weeks ago, and the ebooks will be out of KDP Select by the end of January.</p>
<p>When one commenter assumed that Konrath knew all along that subscription services devalued books and asked why leave the party now, Konrath explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>I still don&#8217;t know that. Some authors&#8217; sales have dropped. Others have risen. I need more data, so I opted out several weeks ago. But the period is three months, so they&#8217;re still enrolled until January.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you missed; a KDP author CAN opt out. It&#8217;s our choice.</p>
<p>McM doesn&#8217;t seem to be offering a choice. That&#8217;s bad. Really bad.</p>
<p>The reason most writers sign legacy deals, other than getting an advance, is legacy&#8217;s ability to get paper books onto retail shelves.</p>
<p>This sounds as if McM is foresaking paper&#8211;the one part of the industry they controlled&#8211;and short-selling their authors.</p>
<p>If I was a McM author, I&#8217;d be worried, pissed off, and wondering why the hell my publisher did a complete about-face from the stance that made them collude and price-fix.</p></blockquote>
<p>Konrath is at least the second prominent indie author to announce his exit from KDP Select in the past month. He follows HM Ward and other authors in abandoning an idea which had seemed so promising 3 years ago.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Silva Rhetoricae:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like wildflower seeds tossed on fertile ground, the figures of speech, sometimes called the &#8220;flowers of rhetoric&#8221; (<i>flores rhetoricae</i>), have multiplied into a garden of enormous variety over time. As the right frame of this web resource illustrates, the number of figures of speech can seem quite imposing. And indeed, the number, names, and groupings of figures have been the most variable aspect of rhetoric over its history.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Schemes and tropes both have to do with using language in an unusual or &#8220;figured&#8221; way:</p>
<p>Trope: An artful deviation from the ordinary or principal signification of a word.Scheme: An artful deviation from the ordinary arrangement of words.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>&#8220;I work like a slave&#8221; [trope: simile]</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m working my job or my job, me&#8221; [schemes: antimetabole, ellipsis, personification]</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Brain Pickings:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“One can’t write directly about the soul,”</em> Virginia Woolf wrote in her diary. Few writers have come to write about it — and to it — more directly than the novelist, poet, and environmental activist Wendell Berry, who describes himself as “a farmer of sorts and an artist of sorts.”</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Novelty-fetishism, Berry suggests, is an act of vanity that serves neither the creator nor those created for:</p>
<blockquote><p>Works of pride, by self-called creators, with their premium on originality, reduce the Creation to novelty — the faint surprises of minds incapable of wonder.</p>
<p>Pursuing originality, the would-be creator works alone. In loneliness one assumes a responsibility for oneself that one cannot fulfill.</p>
<p>Novelty is a new kind of loneliness.</p></blockquote>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Berry paints pride and despair as two sides of the same coin, both equally culpable in poisoning creative work and pushing us toward loneliness rather than toward the shared belonging that true art fosters:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is the bad work of pride. There is also the bad work of despair — done poorly out of the failure of hope or vision.</p>
<p>Despair is the too-little of responsibility, as pride is the too-much.</p>
<p>The shoddy work of despair, the pointless work of pride, equally betray Creation. They are wastes of life.</p>
<p>For despair there is no forgiveness, and for pride none. Who in loneliness can forgive?</p>
<p>Good work finds the way between pride and despair.</p>
<p>It graces with health. It heals with grace.</p>
<p>It preserves the given so that it remains a gift.</p>
<p>By it, we lose loneliness:</p>
<p>we clasp the hands of those who go before us, and the hands of those who come after us;</p>
<p>we enter the little circle of each other’s arms,</p>
<p>and the larger circle of lovers whose hands are joined in a dance,</p>
<p>and the larger circle of all creatures, passing in and out of life, who move also in a dance, to a music so subtle and vast that no ear hears it except in fragments.</p></blockquote>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Echoing Thoreau’s ode to the woods and psychoanalyst Adam Phillips’s assertion that cultivating a capacity for “fertile solitude” is essential for creative work, Berry extols the ennobling effects of solitude, the kind gained only by surrendering to nature’s gentle gift for quieting the mind:</p>
<blockquote><p>We enter solitude, in which also we lose loneliness…</p>
<p>True solitude is found in the wild places, where one is without human obligation.</p>
<p>One’s inner voices become audible. One feels the attraction of one’s most intimate sources.</p>
<p>In consequence, one responds more clearly to other lives. The more coherent one becomes within oneself as a creature, the more fully one enters into the communion of all creatures.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>English majors were taught to analyze, to find humanity in writing, to see society reflected in texts. Once you break free and can look back on graduation, however, there are some side effects:</p>
<p>1. You can read books, all of the books, and find your own secret stash of meaning in the chapters. It’s just tricky because it’s so very hard to get anyone to pay you to read.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>6. You get sentimental when you think about using a blue book for a test.</p>
<p>7. Someone at some point has told you that your background would allow you to sell insurance, write grants, or sell wine.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>18. You’ve realized how nice it is to talk to someone about books who wasn’t an English major because it’s nice to know your freak flag isn’t actually freakish. Besides, you’ve got other freak flags to display that are far more legitimate.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From TeleRead:</p>
<blockquote><p>The just-released “Independent Library Report for England” launched by the UK government’s Department for Culture, Media and Sport, has outlined a situation that its chief author, William Sieghart, has referred to elsewhere as the brink of “absolute disaster.” And it calls for both wholesale renovation of the UK’s library network, and recognition of their fundamental importance in society.</p>
<p>For one thing, the Report seems to to all too aware of the danger of its conclusions being ignored by politicians. “There have already been far too many library reviews in recent years which have come to nothing,” it warns. “Not enough decision makers at national or local level appear sufficiently aware of the remarkable and vital value that a good library service can offer modern communities of every size and character.” The Report also demolishes any notion that libraries are some outmoded service rendered irrelevant by digital media. “In England, over a third of the population visits their local library. In the poorest areas, that figure rises to nearly a half. It is no wonder that communities feel so passionately about their libraries.” Indeed, it concludes, “the future of libraries as community hubs is essential for the well-being of the nation.”</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>What the Report was actually calling for was “a re-invigoration of the library network,” which “starts with a marked increase and improvement in digital technology, rolling WiFi out to every library in the country.”</p></blockquote>
