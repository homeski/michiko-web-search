<p>“Night Watch” draws the reader into the action from the start, bonding them to the storyline with cliffhanger chapter endings, and keeping them on tenterhooks till the very end. The author uses her specialist knowledge of sailing to good effect, adding a sense of excitement, but is never at risk of alienating less well-informed readers.</p>
<p>The central character, Em Ridge, in her thirties, is recently widowed after a tragic boating accident. A newly qualified captain, she sets off from Canada to the Caribbean, in charge of her first commercial delivery of a luxury sailing ship. Not long after they depart, a crew member disappears – an incident that threatens to scupper Em&#8217;s career and reputation. Soon a bizarre connection emerges between this death and Em&#8217;s late husband’s, and the mystery becomes ever more complex, with Em&#8217;s life increasingly endangered.</p>
<p>Key themes include the nature of friendships and families &#8211; how well we really know each other and the difference between friends and families. Estranged from her own family, Em has formed close friendships with her neighbours who support her at times of crisis. The class distinctions and the ethics of the sailing community are explored, as is the meaning of true wealth. Also under consideration are the social mores of those who, like Em, choose to tread their own unconventional path.</p>
<p>The characters are engaging and well drawn. I especially enjoyed the portrayal of Em&#8217;s neighbours and of Ben, the new police officer who has moved to the area after a personal tragedy. Their relationships, dialogue and actions were believable and consistent, and I was rooting for Em right from the start.</p>
<p>The plot flowed well, but a number of minor typos drew me up occasionally—however, the author assures me that these have since been attended to. The style was natural and easy, and the only writing tic that I spotted was the habit of using &#8220;um&#8221; or &#8220;uh&#8221; or &#8220;ah&#8221; to make a speech sound hesitant. This made them sound phony; the speeches would have been just as effective without.</p>
<p>This was a gripping and satisfying read that would appeal to readers who are interested in leisure sailing, those who like cosy mysteries, and those keen on stories set on the eastern seaboard of Canada.</p>
<p>The ending was satisyfing and tidy, though my head reeled from so many twists and turns, none of which I&#8217;d predicted. Em&#8217;s personal growth, as she gains confidence in who she is and what she stands for, was rewarding for the reader. As we part company with her, she is set to move on beyond her bereavement, to advances in her career, and possibly to a new, cautious and gentle relationship with Ben.</p>
<p>The neat conclusion leaves a good set-up for a sequel. It’s always pleasing to discover an enjoyable new series, and I’d be keen to read what Em gets up to next.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">A grisly murder in a sleepy Scottish Borders village opens this debut novel by Janet O&#8217;Kane. The body is discovered by a relative newcomer to the village, who has joined the local surgery as a GP. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Doctor Moreland is the central character and the novel, written in the third person, is told from her point of view. However, it is a distant, almost clinical POV, and given that she survives two attempts on her life, is involved in three suspicious deaths, and is just starting a relationship, I would like to have seen some more intimate third person perspective apart from her doubts about her prospective boyfriend. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">There is a good range of characters, with many of the supporting ones well portrayed, revealing more about them gradually as the novel progresses. The atmosphere of a small village is well created through the use of dialogue and characterisation.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The plot is not just a whodunit but manages to weave different sub-plots neatly into the main story without being distracting and there are some interesting red herrings and twists. The beginning is paced more slowly to set context, and pauses slightly at times with some minor insignificant detail, but as more is revealed later in the book, the pace picks up considerably, and through a number of red herrings and twists, builds up to an unexpected climax.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"> </span>Strengths of this book were characterisation, thoughtful plot (and sub-plots), and the way the story played out. A lot of the story was conveyed through dialogue and was well-written and credible. When the immediate action happened it was very good. There were few literal errors.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Recommended to anyone who likes a mystery/crime novel that focuses on thinking, and one that</span><span lang="EN-GB">—</span><span lang="EN-GB">in its favour</span><span lang="EN-GB">—</span><span lang="EN-GB">isn&#8217;t full of unnecessary gore. It&#8217;s a good first novel.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/writing-tips-avoid-starting-sentences-with-participles/"><img width="890" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/authors-services-890x400.jpg" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="authors-services" /></a><p>Starting sentences with participles, she remembered, was a mark of a hack writer.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>This is what Renni Brown and David King say in the chapter on sophistication in the book ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060545690/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060545690&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lethalinheri-20">Self-Editing for Fiction Writers, Second Edition: How to Edit Yourself into Print</a>. P193.</p>
<p>&#8220;One easy way to make your writing see more sophisticated is to avoid two stylistic constructions that are common to hack writers, namely:</p>
<p>Pulling off her gloves, she turned to face him.</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>As she pulled off her gloves, she turned to face him.</p>
<p>Both the ‘as’ construction and the ‘-ing’ construction as used above are grammatically correct and express the action clearly and unambiguously. But notice that both of these constructions take a bit of action (She pulled off her gloves) and tuck it away into a dependent clause (Pulling off her gloves &#8230;). This tends to place some of your action at one remove from your reader, to make the actions seem incidental, unimportant. If you use these constructions often, you weaken your writing.&#8221;</p>
<p>This little gem of writing knowledge does not seem to be generally available. I learned it from an editor who works for the biggest Australian publishing house. She told me that it can be effective maybe ‘once every 10,000 words’ but that usage over that tends to make the writing ‘flat and samey’. That’s no more than around 8 uses in an ordinary sized novel.</p>
<p>If you think this partial ban on participles ending in &#8216;ing&#8217; heading up sentences is a matter of stylistic choice that you can afford to ignore, show me a book published by the big 6 that overuses this construction, and ask yourself if you’re really willing to ignore the advice of editors that have been editing for mainstream publishers for years?</p>
<p>Besides, how often do sentences starting with a verb ending in ‘ing’ actually sound good? Mostly they sound awkward or bland.</p>
<p>“Running down the road, she got hit by a car. Rolling out of the way, she ended up in the gutter but still alive.”</p>
<p>Yuk. Give me too much of that and I’ll throw your book down in disgust.</p>
<p>And so far, I’ve only talked about the grammatically correct version.</p>
<p><strong>Worse, don’t let your participle dangle.</strong></p>
<p>When you do use a participle phrase make sure that it is connected to a human agency. The word after the comma, should refer to a human not an object.</p>
<p>Wrong: Having been named chairman, the meeting was called by Craig.</p>
<p>Craig was named chairman, not the meeting.</p>
<p>Correct: Having been named chairman, Craig called the meeting.</p>
<p>What is really unfortunate is that some of the books I’ve read that have this problem of overuse of sentences beginning with participles ending in &#8216;ing&#8217; have, according to their authors, been edited by a ‘professional.’ If you want to check if your editor knows what they’re doing, pepper your first few pages with some sentences starting with ‘as’ or an ‘ing ending verb’. If they don’t change all of them, get another editor.</p>

<p><em>The night before the night before Christmas</em> is an adorable heart-warming tale that I would recommend to everyone, young and old. It tells the story of Elfie, one of Santa’s elves who spends the whole day working on one toy, while his comrades rush to complete all the presents for the children of the world.</p>
<p>It holds a sweet message, that sometimes speed and volume of productivity isn’t the best thing. That it’s okay to spend a lot of time on one thing if you make it perfect. This is something that people can forget in this modern age and it’s important to remember this and teach to children.<br />
The story ties together two Christmas traditions in a beautifully understated way. I think linking them like this is a great way of introducing them to children.</p>
<p>The illustrations enhance and complement the story, making you fall in love with the characters immediately. Not to mention how incredibly skilled the artwork is. The entire production of the book is of a highly professional standard. It is a good, large size and comfortable to hold while lying in bed reading to your child, which is just what you want from this kind of children’s book.</p>
<p>I recommend this book for the AIA Seal of Excellence.</p>

<p><em>Prunella Smith: Worlds Within Worlds</em> by <a href="http://tahlianewland.com" target="_blank">Tahlia Newland</a> has been awarded the <a style="color: #fc6236;" href="http://awesomeindies.net/about/seal-of-approval/">AIA Seal of Excellence </a> in Fiction.</p>
<h2>Blurb:</h2>
<p><em>‘The barrier between the worlds shatters like the window. The beast is loose. My nightmare has become real. The guy has totally lost it. If he finds us here, we could die. No, I don’t doubt it; we will die.’</em></p>
<p>Author and editor Prunella Smith inhabits a multilayered reality. Physically, she lives in the Australian bush with her crazy cat Merlin. In her work world, she edits the love story of Kelee, a Magan Lord’s daughter, and in the cyber-world of social media, she’s subjected to slanderous attacks by a disgruntled author. To complicate matters further she sees things through the eyes of a Tibetan Yogi, has strange dreams and relives forgotten memories.</p>
<p>Separate worlds, interconnected and complementary, but can they help when Prunella becomes victim to a real life stalker and her sanity is threatened?</p>
<p><em>Worlds Within Worlds</em> has a unique perspective on the nature of creativity. Its touch is light, its humour distinctive but it reaches deep into the nature of human experience.</p>
<h2>Editorial Reviews:</h2>
<p>“This is riveting stuff, part magical realism dreamscape, part taut psychological thriller, and I was literally on the edge of my seat when the final twist – and what a twist it is – came around. Phew, what a ride!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I forget most books within days, sometimes less. I won&#8217;t forget this one.&#8221; Awesome Indies reviewers</p>

<p>Bill Kirton&#8217;s <em>The Darkness</em> charts the moral journey of a doctor who succumbs to fantasies of revenge. Dr. Andrew Davidson seeks justice for his brother, who commits suicide after his wife and daughter die in a car crash. He wants to punish not just the drunk driver who caused the accident, but other sociopaths who destroy lives and evade punishment. One by one, suspected criminals begin to disappear from the streets of Cairnburgh, Scotland.</p>
<p>Inspector Jack Carston, charged with investigating the disappearances, has mixed feelings. He isn&#8217;t sorry to have rapists, child molesters, and killers off the streets, but whoever has taken them is equally a criminal. He and his partner set about solving the cases in their quiet, methodical way.</p>
<p><em>The Darkness</em> pits a compelling antihero against a reticent hero. Both are intelligent and likable. Davidson is kind to his patients, considerate of his coworkers, and sweet to his girlfriend. Carston loves his wife and enjoys his work. But the doctor eclipses the inspector through most of the story.</p>
<p>The doctor becomes the dramatic center as soon as he appears, largely because of the narrative point of view. Most of the narrative is third-person omniscient, but the doctor addresses the reader in first-person, which is direct and intimate and places him at the emotional core of the story. Everything happens around him. Eventually we learn that we&#8217;re reading his confession, addressed to Carston. This device links the doctor to the detective and underscores their shared need to see justice done.</p>
<p>Once the investigation begins to break, Carston&#8217;s role becomes more active and his character takes center stage. Still, the doctor remains the heart of the story. What will he do with the captives in his basement? Will his sanity survive the trauma of the crimes he&#8217;s committed?</p>
<p>Kirton writes elegant prose and creates memorable characters. Even secondary players stand out. I won&#8217;t forget the prostitute Rhona or her devoted boyfriend, Billy, for a long time. <em>The Darkness</em> might confound some readers who expect every mystery novel to follow a conventional pattern, but those who enjoy intelligent psychological suspense are in for a treat.</p>

<p>This is an excellent children’s picture book for Christmas. The story is beautiful, written by Jay Dee in simple but elegant and evocative prose, and the illustrations by Darren Geers are beautiful, colourful without being garish and with a truly lovely light quality. The book has also been beautifully produced, nicely printed and well laid out.</p>
<p>The illustrations create a large part of the book’s charm. The artist has imbued the drawings of Elfie, the other elves and Santa Clause with a great deal of expression. They beam off the page.</p>
<p>But the story itself does something wonderful; it merges the story of Santa Clause with the birth of Jesus, and also makes a clear statement on the kind of dedication required to achieve perfection. Santa Clause and his role as gift bringer to the good, and Christmas as the story of Jesus Christ’s birth can easily seem like two unrelated ideas of Christmas, but this story shows that it doesn’t have to be like that.</p>
<p>I love this story so much that I will read it to my family on Christmas day—and my child is twenty one!</p>
<p>I give this book 5 stars, and nominate it for an AIA Seal of Excellence as an excellent example of a children’s picture book.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/worlds-within-worlds-review-long-overdue/"><img width="890" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB-890x400.jpg" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="Worlds_Final-WEB" /></a><p><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-10620 aligncenter" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB-198x300.jpg" alt="Worlds_Final-WEB" width="198" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I received a free copy of Tahlia Newland’s Prunella Smith: Worlds within Worlds for review, and I have to say up front – this is a book that is long overdue. It addresses cyber bullying, especially as it pertains to writers and reviewers, but does so in a chilling way that will live you looking over your shoulder with every word you write.</p>
<p>Prunella Smith is a freelance editor and author who is up against a deadline on an editing job – a fantasy story about an adventurous woman, Kelee, who is having an affair with a young groomsman on her estate. Ella, as she is known, is also a book reviewer, and a recent review of a not-so-good novel has provoked the author, Dita, to begin a campaign of on-line stalking and bullying. Dita’s cyber bullying begins to take its toll, interfering with Ella’s ability to objectively edit Kelee’s story, and things only get worse when she discovers that she has a physical stalker as well.</p>
<p>Newland’s tale kept me interested from page one – and the little surprise she threw in near the end, well -2 I didn’t see that one coming. A thoroughly entertaining story. An easy five stars here.</p>
