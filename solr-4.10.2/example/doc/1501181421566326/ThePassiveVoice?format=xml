				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From author Ann Warner via Romance University:</p>
<blockquote><p>Forgoing the traditional imprimatur of agents or editors, authors who self-publish become the ones responsible for judging the quality of their work. The problem is that after passing through the creative maelstrom required to write a novel, the author’s judgment about the quality of their story is likely to be flawed.  Rightly or wrongly, the author may be convinced that her story is</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A. So wonderful it would make Hemingway weep</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">B. So dreadful it’s not worth even a penny</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">C. Probably good enough</p>
<p>A and C are by far the most dangerous choices, because they are likely to result in premature publication.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the conclusion is B, and the writer overcomes her discouragement, she may then begin to look for ways to improve the story.</p>
<p>I didn’t begin writing fiction until my mid-fifties, when my position as a director of a hospital toxicology laboratory ended abruptly with the closure of the laboratory. While trying to decide what to do with the rest of my life, I received a surprising nudge from my sub-conscious to try writing a story.</p>
<p>When I finished that story, it was, in my opinion, most definitely an A. Every one of its 125,000 words was perfect. Had self-publishing been a viable option at that time, I would have chosen it. Immediately.</p>
<p>But self-publishing wasn’t yet easy, something that was lucky for me, because the novel was most definitely not an A. I began to recognize its B status after a friend read the book (or perhaps only a few pages) and then brought me flowers and congratulated me profusely on writing it. Only later did I realize she’d said nothing about whether it was any good. I still feel an immense gratitude to her for so gently bumping me back to reality from my first novel infatuation daze.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>I talked a professor into letting me take a senior writing seminar in the MFA program at the university where I was a faculty member. Not necessarily a path I recommend.</p>
<p>I joined RWA and began attending my local chapter’s meetings and writing workshops.</p>
<p>I searched out other writers to serve as critic partners in person or on the internet.</p>
<p>I began querying agents and publishers and learned to cope with the subsequent deluge of rejection.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I started reading books and articles on writing craft, noting specific suggestions I could begin using as I started working on another novel.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>I gleaned a number of specific suggestions that I began applying during my revision process and while they may seem simplistic, I discovered they had a dramatic effect on the quality of my writing. They included:</p>
<p>Avoid overuse of names in dialogue: “Yes, Cassandra, I see the whale.” “Oh, I’m glad you do, Jonah.” “Of course, Cassandra, I’ll just move out of the— eughhhh!” Etc, etc.</p>
<p>Avoid dialogue tags like she screamed or he yelled in favor of the simple he said/she said and limit modifying adverbs (e.g. she said coaxingly, angrily etc.). Instead “show” these attributes by writing robust dialogue.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Storytelling, you see, is a right brain, creative activity. Whether it can be learned is an open question, but it can certainly be enhanced, and I have a two-fold recommendation to help with that enhancement.</p>
<p>First, teach yourself to pay attention to those flickers of inspiration presented to the conscious mind by the unconscious through dreams, daydreams, or random thoughts.  The trick is to catch those quick glints before they fade, and then make a note. Otherwise, they will fade, and you will forget. Guaranteed.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From The Wall Street Journal:</p>
<blockquote><p>Atticus Lish ’s “Preparation for the Next Life” got the kind of reception that first-time novelists only dream about. The gritty debut novel, set in the violent, dangerous margins of New York City, was one of 2014’s genuine literary sensations, earning ecstatic reviews and landing on many top-10 lists. Writing in The Wall Street Journal, critic Sam Sacks called the novel, “a tour de force of urban naturalism” and “a love story that’s as bold and urgent as any you’ll read this year.”</p>
<p>But in a stark illustration that fiction writing often doesn’t pay, Mr. Lish has so far made only $2,000 for his novel, which took five years to write.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Mr. Lish struck a deal with an obscure publisher, Tyrant Books. By eschewing a larger publishing house, Mr. Lish potentially left a hefty advance on the table. In October, for example, “The Longings of Jende Jonga,” a debut novel by Cameroon-born Imbolo Mbue, was grabbed up by Random House for seven figures.</p>
<p>The bleakness of Mr. Lish’s novel may have precluded an advance of that magnitude. But all involved agree he could have gotten more than he did.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Tyrant’s founder, Giancarlo DiTrapano, had high hopes for the book but wasn’t prepared for the avalanche of critical praise it would trigger. Opting to print it in paperback, not hardcover, he says he took the advice of his distributor and ordered an initial print run of 3,500 copies—the largest the publisher had ever done. The book was released on Oct. 20. By Nov. 12, the day the first glowing review came out in the New York Times, it was clear it would sell out quickly, just as the critical holiday season got under way.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>When the Times review appeared, Ms. Urban asked Mr. DiTrapano how many books were in print.</p>
<p>“He said 3,500,” Ms. Urban recalled. “I wanted to kill myself.”</p>
<p>While Mr. DiTrapano scrambled to order an additional 10,000 copies, he made an expensive deal with Amazon to print copies of the book on demand for the three weeks or so until the reprints arrived.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>The publisher, out of money and out of credit, was on the verge of shutting down his press. Mr. Johnson wanted to help. Partying together late one night, they struck a deal: Mr. Johnson would invest in Tyrant, ultimately in exchange for 50% of the company. Mr. Johnson would take care of the business end while Mr. DiTrapano would stick to editing. “He said, ‘You’re a great editor but a terrible businessman,’” said Mr. DiTrapano, age 40. “I said, ‘I know.’”</p>
<p>“I thought that he had good taste,” said Mr. Johnson, 45. “Just because he doesn’t have any money or credit doesn’t mean he shouldn’t be a publisher.”</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>He launched Tyrant Books in 2009 and quickly developed a reputation as a bad boy of the publishing world. In 2013, the Los Angeles Review of Books published a story about him: “He Offered Me Cocaine.” (Mr. DiTrapano says he parties less now, but is still an unashamed user of recreational drugs.)</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Mr. Lish signed for an advance of $2,000. He acknowledges that if he had used his father’s connections, he could have gotten more money. But the author, who for 12 years was estranged from his father, said it was important to do it on his own. “It was life-changing,” Mr. Lish said, describing the moment when Mr. DiTrapano offered to publish the novel. “He let me put out the book that I wanted to do. That was the most important thing for me.”</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From author John Brown:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is Amazon in the process of ushering in a totalitarian book economy?</p>
<p>Is Bezos, as Hitler was in the 1930s, biding his time, playing a long game, one that will lull the masses into a false sense of bookish security? Are we appeasing him, letting him take over the continent bit by bit? Is the blitzkrieg less than a decade away?</p>
<p>If you listened to a recent Intelligence<sup>2</sup> debate, you would have heard Franklin Foer and Scott Turow claim that, yes, that’s exactly where we are headed. On the other side of the debate were Joe Konrath and Matthew Yglesais, arguing that Amazon is the reader’s friend.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Well, [Foer and Turow] argument went like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon right now provides an amazing service that’s far and above anything any other bookseller currently provides. They have made more books more accessible to more readers than anyone else ever in history. Readers, of course, love this. But this is a bad thing.</li>
<li>It’s bad because Amazon is becoming a monopoly–it already has 41% of all new book and 67% of all e-book sales, and in many divisions of those markets it has even more.</li>
<li>If Amazon were an enlightened ruler like Aslan, okay. But Amazon is a business, and as a business it only cares about its profits. And the way to make profits is buy low and sell high. So when Amazon finishes consolidating its hold on the market, it will force publishers and authors to take less of the pie.</li>
<li>In fact, Foer-Turow claim Amazon wants to not just reduce the share of the pie publishers get, it wants to kill off the publishers and take their share of the book pie completely. In addition to being very poor manners, this is bad for three other reasons.</li>
<li>First, authors of non-fiction books that take a long time to research will never be able to get the money they need to do that research. Publishers are the only ones who can give them that money, which they do in the form of an advance.</li>
<li>Second, few authors of fiction will be able to afford good editing, marketing, and book design, and so the many voices that could have been heard will be stifled, or never rise out of the crap to their true potential.</li>
<li>Third, and this is the nefarious Nazi part, if Amazon is the only place you see books, they can control which books you see, which means they will exert enormous control over our culture because they will be able to suppress some books, and therefore the ideas in those books, and promote others. Foer-Turow claim Amazon has already done this.</li>
<li>Finally, because it’s a business and has a goal of profit, when Amazon covers the land, it will probably eventually charge readers more. In fact, it may charge them a lot more. It can’t avoid it; it’s a business.</li>
</ul>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>You need to know I’m not an Amazon groupie. Nor am I a hater of publishers. I am a businessman. I’m looking for good partners. And I recently wrote a post pointing out that it’s delusional for authors to think Amazon is their BFF with pinky rings. They are just, at the moment, a great indie partner. But their interests and mine are not perfectly aligned. Our love is definitely not written in the stars.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>But has the government given Amazon a legal monopoly?</p>
<p>Um, nope. No charters here to be the only fur trappers in the West.</p>
<p>Does Amazon have an army of thugs who are going to beat people up and make them join Amazon Prime?</p>
<p>No. Well, maybe that’s what the drones are for, but they haven’t rolled them out yet.</p>
<p>Do they own something nobody else can get, like a piece of land? Are they sitting on the world’s largest reserves of cheap book oil?</p>
<p>Nope. They’ve got a great website and excellent logistics. But websites really aren’t that hard. And if we’re talking ebooks, you don’t need logistics.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>What about the barriers to entry?</p>
<p>The big advantage Amazon has is that they usually have the lowest book prices around, the biggest selection (you can find almost any book you want there in any format it’s available in), and are incredibly convenient, providing samples, reviews, recommendations, and easy checkout. And they have the crowds.</p>
<p>It’s hard to get crowds. It’s hard to get all that content. It’s hard to beat their prices. Those are some dang good barriers that keep new guys out.</p>
<p>And Foer-Turow figured that’s all set. In stone.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>So is Amazon going to kill publishers? Only if the humans have left the building.</p>
<p>Will they kill authors? Only if authors let them.</p>
<p>Will they gouge readers? Not when other folks see there’s money to be made by undercutting them.</p>
<p>Amazon is playing in a global market with the likes of Alibaba, Google, Apple, Walmart, etc. Amazon is playing in an internet economy where college students can come up with an idea and become billionaires. Equally important, Amazon owns nothing that somebody else can’t recreate. They have no legal monopoly. They have no army of thugs. What they have is a lot of content, a well-known URL, logistics for the hard copies, and good prices.</p>
<p>But what they do not have is a marketplace where everyone else involved is absent a brain.</p></blockquote>

<p>I envy William Hague. Not the £2.5 million country house he’s just bought in Wales, although that would be nice. Rather, the fact that he plans to spend his retirement writing books.</p>
</div>
<div class="secondPar">
<p>These days, you need a substantial private income – or a public sector pension – to be a full-time writer. Last year, a survey of 2,500 professional authors found that their median income in 2013 was £11,000. That’s a drop of 29 per cent since 2005 and significantly below the minimum salary required to achieve a decent standard of living.</p>
</div>
<div class="thirdPar">
<p>The writing game is notoriously lopsided, in which a small handful of bestselling authors earn a fortune and the vast majority live on scraps, but it’s got worse in the past decade. “You&#8217;ve always been able to comfortably house the British literary writers who can earn all their living from books in a single room,” says the author Will Self, whose own royalties have tailed off in recent years. “That room used to be a reception one, now it&#8217;s a back bedroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<div class="fourthPar">
<p>In 2012, Susan Hill, author of The Woman in Black, told her Twitter followers that she was broke, in spite of the fact that the film of her book had earned £100 million worldwide.</p>
</div>
<div class="fifthPar">
<p>Having written a bestseller is no guarantee you’ll be able to earn a living, as I know from experience. How to Lose Friends and Alienate People, my 2001 memoir about working for Vanity Fair in New York, sold a quarter of a million copies and was turned into a Hollywood movie. Fast forward 10 years and I was asked by Penguin if I would write an ebook for free.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>I wrote another book last year (What Every Parent Needs to Know), and this time I actually received a small advance. But I had to give half that money to a collaborator because I was too busy earning a living to write it on my own.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Kristine Kathryn Rusch:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new year hadn’t even had a week to catch its breath before the first year-end numbers for 2014 appeared. The definitive numbers—if you can call any numbers “definitive” in traditional publishing—won’t show up until late February or early March. But the early numbers reveal quite a bit.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>I often find <em>Publishers Marketplace’s</em> analysis of the publishing industry useful, not because it’s accurate, but because it gives me a fairly clear snapshot of what the traditional industry’s thoughts on the business are. <em>Publishers Marketplace’s </em>focus on traditional means that it misses a lot of the trends and changes that happen because of indie.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Nielsen Bookscan reported that <em>print</em> book sales—in the outlets that report to Bookscan—went up 2.4% in 2014 over sales from 2013. Half of the gain in sales—1.2%—came from a better-than-expected holiday season.</p>
<p>In that first week, <em>Publishers Marketplace</em> went deeper into the numbers than <em>Publishers Weekly </em>did and came out with some fascinating information, some of which I’ll deal with in the next week or two. But here’s the take-away:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>All of the year’s gains and then some came from backlist, however, not newly-released titles. Frontlist unit sales fell 2 million units to 276 million, while backlist sales rose 17 million units to 359 million…</em></p>
<p>Those of us who’ve been publishing indie have known how powerful the backlist is since 2010. Fortunately for most of us early adapters, the traditional publishing industry didn’t get the memo for about three years. They started to get a clue in 2013 that there was wine in those dusty old bottles, which is why it’s become harder and harder to get rights reverted from traditional publishers in the past couple of years.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Traditional publishers still don’t have a complete clue about the importance of the rise of the backlist, as evidenced by this comment from <em>Publishers Marketplace</em>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>[backlist sales rose]…reflecting the lack of new breakout hits…</em></p>
<p>Sorry, <em>Publishers Marketplace</em>, no. The backlist rose because the industry is changing. The way books are being sold <em>everywhere</em>, not just online, is changing. Readers are changing.</p>
<p>Well, actually, readers are staying the same. They want “what they want, when they want it, and at a reasonable price” to quote Kevin Spacey on the lessons Netflix learned from <em>House of Cards</em>.</p>
<p>Readers have always wanted that. But traditional publishing, like all other media in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, was based on the scarcity model: if you make readers hunger for a book, they’ll pay more when they see one. They also buy it immediately, and they’ll be grateful for what’s offered, rather than buy what they like.</p>
<p>The internet broke the scarcity model.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Because the entire traditional publishing business is based on the scarcity model, <em>Publishers Marketplace</em> can’t understand the rise of the backlist. The rise doesn’t fit into the scarcity model.</p>
<p>Here’s the logic of the situation when looked at from the scarcity model: if people are buying “old” books, then the new books aren’t satisfying. The new books aren’t “good.”</p>
<p>That analysis was true-ish before backlist was constantly available. I say true-<em>ish</em> because, remember, not a lot of “old” books were available—just the ones that readers would keep recommending to their friends, so publishers couldn’t take those books out of print.</p>
<p>Back then, breakout books happened for two reasons: First, the books stayed on the shelves long enough to get word of mouth; and second, the books dominated the conversation.</p>
<p>It’s almost impossible to dominate the conversation now. Traditional publishing doesn’t control every book that makes its way into the media now. One book might get some traction, but definitely not <em>all</em> of the traction.</p>
<p>And the conversation moves faster as well. We might discuss Book A today, but tomorrow we could be discussing Book J. Or not discussing any traditionally published book at all.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>My dollars are finite, just like yours are, but book-buying dollars are not. Now that more books are available to more people, book sales should—logically—go up.</p>
<p>And they are. But they are going up outside of the traditional models. At least 20,000 of my ebook sales in 2014 did not get counted by any traditional measure—Bookscan or otherwise. I say “at least” because I don’t know if Smashwords sales count toward Bookscan numbers or if some of the other ebook sites (like Kobo) count as well. I do know that Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble ebook sales get counted.</p>
<p>So there is a shadow industry. There always has been. Even Bookscan itself says that it only covers 80% of the print book business. That’s up, by the way, from the old days, when Bookscan was less than 50%. There’s a lot of give in that 20%. And that’s in the <em>traditional</em> industry.</p>
<p>There’s even more give when you consider indie publishing. A lot of indie writers publish their print books without an ISBN, so the books don’t get tracked by traditional means. I suspect Bookscan covers 80% of the traditional market, but in all of trade publishing? I think that Bookscan misses a lot of books. How many? I have no idea. I doubt anyone does.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From author Claire Cook via Unbound:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wrote my first novel in my minivan in the parking lot outside my daughter’s swim practice when I was 45. At 50, I walked the red carpet at the Hollywood premiere of the movie adaptation of my most well-known novel, <em>Must Love Dogs</em>, starring Diane Lane and John Cusack.</p>
<p>For a long time, Plan A worked for me. I was one of the lucky authors.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>And then my career stalled out. The traditional publishing world, which had nurtured me so well, didn’t seem to be able to get it moving again. So long story short, I eventually decided that rather than hang around and whine about it, I’d move on to Plan B: self-publishing.</p>
<p>. . . .<br />
<strong>Do you have a better option?</strong> I now think of my years as a traditionally published author as the best internship ever. I kept my ears open and learned from the pros. I internalized the voices of several fabulous editors and had time to figure out who I am as a writer. If you’re just starting out and you can get in the traditional door, it will enhance your skills as well as give you street cred, so my advice would be to go for it. If those doors don’t open for you, shake it off and move on to Plan B. As I meet more and more self-published authors who have built their careers from scratch, I’m both humbled and inspired by them, but also really grateful that I didn’t have to do it myself.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p><strong>Is it all about the writing for you?</strong> Several books ago, a surprised new editor said to me, “Wow, it’s still all about the writing for you, isn’t it?” Absolutely. And the day it isn’t, the day I’ve lost that passion, I hope I have the good sense to go find something else I can love just as much as I’ve loved writing books. I put my heart and soul into every book I write, and I try to become a better writer with each one. My readers know that, to the best of my ability, I will never let them down.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Digital Book World:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most publishers consider social media an essential part of their marketing toolkits, but author and squidoo.com founder Seth Godin joined Digital Book World 2015 in New York City this morning to turn that idea on its head.</p>
<p>“Not all of your authors want to be good at social media. Not all of them have something to say when they’re not writing their book,” he told publishers.</p>
<p>In Godin’s view, the emphasis on building author platforms has gone too far. If so many authors now approach social media as a part of their jobs in the digital era, it’s at least partly thanks to their publishers, who have assiduously told them it is. But the problem is that it often looks that way to readers.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From essayist Arthur Kristol:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before the 18th century, no self-respecting man of letters (who, after all, had been weaned on the ancients) would have thought to dismiss the authors who had formed his education. The past wasn’t something to surpass or circumvent, but to adapt and make relevant.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>In Edward Young’s <em>Conjectures on Original Composition</em> (1759), we find the notion that &#8220;the first ancients had no merit in being originals; they could not be imitators. Modern writers have a choice to make and therefore have a merit in their power.&#8221;</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>[W]hat made the postmodern charter different was its willingness to discard the very idea of standards. Starting from the premise that aesthetics were just another social construct rather than a product of universal principles, postmodernist thinkers succeeded in toppling hierarchies and nullifying the literary canon. Indeed, they were so good at unearthing the socioeconomic considerations behind canon formation that even unapologetic highbrows had to wonder if they hadn’t been bamboozled.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>[N]ow add to the mix an Internet that enables every autodidact with a bad teacher to address the world and pretty soon the world begins to tilt. The razing of aesthetic standards combined with the reallocation of cultural consensus in the form of blogs and Amazon reviews must surely affect the books we write. Almost 70 years ago, Erich Auerbach proposed that a nation’s literature depends in large part on the nature of the reading public. So what happens when that reading public becomes for the first time truly public, not only in the sense that every reader can finally be heard but that his or her voice is hardly less valid than those stemming from our cultural or educational institutions?</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>We live amid a great sprawl of what passes for literature, a diffusion prophesied years ago by Houston Baker, a president of the Modern Language Association who declared that choosing between Virginia Woolf and Pearl Buck is “no different from choosing between a hoagie and a pizza.” And in this blur of the present, when every book, every critical evaluation, is almost immediately swept aside by another, there seems little of consequence. . . .</p>
<p>Although serious writers continue to work in the hope that time will forgive them for writing well, the prevailing mood welcomes fiction and poetry of every stripe, as long as the reading public champions it. And this I think is a huge mistake. Literature has never just been about the public (even when the public has embraced such canonical authors as Hugo, Dickens, and Tolstoy ). Literature has always been a conversation among writers who borrow, build upon, and deviate from each other’s words. Forgetting this, we forget that aesthetics is not a social invention, that democracy is not an aesthetic category; and that the dismantling of hierarchies is tantamount to an erasure of history.</p></blockquote>
