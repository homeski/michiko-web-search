</p><p>By <a href="http://twitter.com/caballofrances" target="_blank">Frances Caballo</a></p>
<p>One of my tasks last year was to create an integrated editorial calendar for my upcoming podcasts (Social Media for Authors Podcast), Friday blog posts, and newsletters.</p>
<p>The content calendar in turn directed my social media calendar.</p>
<p>I hate to admit this, but I’d never created this type of calendar before. I’ve written three-month editorial calendars for my blog, but never one that was so detailed.</p>
<p>My first task was to brainstorm topic ideas. Some people use mind maps for this step, but I’ve never found one that I liked.</p>
<p>So I applied my fingertips to the keyboard and started writing whatever came to mind. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blogging Apps &#038; Plugins I Wouldn’t Be Without
</li>
<p>
<li>Marketing Strategies for Indie Authors
</li>
<p>
<li>Is Facebook Advertising Worth It for Authors?
</li>
<p>
<li>Why Authors Need a Pinterest Business Account
</li>
<p>
<li>How to Engage Your Readers</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>Each topic becomes a theme, which I note in a separate column, and every bit of data I introduce supports the main thesis.</p>
<p>Next, I decide on one call to action and note that in the next column. I’m an author so right now the calls to action are for one of my books.</p>
<p>In the next column, I list the web address to previous posts that are pertinent to the theme. This step is followed by the web addresses of other posts I find on the blogosphere that contain valuable information within the established theme.</p>
<p>In the next three contiguous columns, I write In the final columns: the date the episode airs, the date my blog post publishes, and the designated date for my newsletter. (Note: My blog subscribers do not receive the newsletter.)</p>
<p>Finally, I have a column for when I create the artwork.</p>
<p>You can add additional columns to incorporate your social media marketing plans. They can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How often you’ll post the information.
</li>
<p>
<li>Which social media networks you’ll post it on.
</li>
<p>
<li>The changes in title you’ll create for each tweet if you send recurring tweets.
</li>
<p>
<li>If you write in different genres, you might want to add a column for the specific demographic you’re targeting.
</li>
<p>
<li>Maybe you want to use specific keywords in different posts depending on your specific demographic. You can do the research in advance and plug it into your content calendar. </li>
<p>
</ul>
<h3>The Benefits of Planning a Content Calendar</h3>
<p>There have been times in my life when I’ve gone without a calendar. It’s not a particularly good feeling.</p>
<p>When it’s time to write, I have to spend time researching topics. That’s what I love about the calendar; the research has already been done.</p>
<p>Having a calendar doesn’t mean that you have to stick to it. Life happens; issues shift. If you have a sudden burst of inspiration and want to change some items on your calendar, do it.</p>
<p>Don’t ever let a calendar stifle your bursts of creativity.</p>
<p>Here are some of the benefits that you will derive from having an editorial calendar:</p>
<ol>
<li>You won’t have to face the question, “What will I write about today?”
</li>
<p>
<li>You can incorporate holidays into your calendar and plan ahead for them.
</li>
<p>
<li>You can incorporate book launches into your calendar.
</li>
<p>
<li>You can include content to support book sales, book readings, and other efforts that promote your books.
</li>
<p>
<li>It makes your social media marketing easier because you’ll be able to plan future tweets and Facebook posts and artwork for Pinterest. </li>
<p>
</ol>
<p>There’s another benefit to developing a calendar. If you track web visits, retweets, and other forms of social sharing, you will develop a body of evidence. This evidence will be in the form of dates your readers were more likely to share you content, dates when web traffic spiked, and dates when book sales improved.</p>
<p>Then you can refer to your calendar and determine which types of content triggered engagement and sales, and which type of content left your website a tad lonely with few to no visits.</p>

<p>I’d love to know how you prepare your calendars and what you include in them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="post_image_link" href="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/2015/01/call-for-reviewers/" title="Permanent link to Call for Reviewers"><img class="post_image aligncenter" src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bigstock-Male-Professor-Shouting-Though-64053307.jpg" width="530" height="275" alt="Post image for Call for Reviewers" /></a>
</p><p>Have you ever spent time researching online, going from site to site trying to find the kind of help you need? Sure, me too, everybody does. <em>That makes you a good candidate to review my new book.</em></p>
<p>And I think it&#8217;s one of the reasons <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Self-Publishers-Ultimate-Resource-Guide-Directory--ebook/dp/B00QSKUS2Q/?tag=marinbo-20" target="_blank">The Self-Publisher&#8217;s Ultimate Resource Guide</a> has been so popular. It really helps.</p>
<p>The book, coauthored with traditional publishing pro <a href="http://www.spresourceguide.com/" target="_blank">Betty Kelly Sargent</a>, was #1 in its category on Amazon.com on publication day, and has stayed there ever since, almost a month later.</p>
<p>That tells me people are finding real value. The over 850 curated, verified, and up-to-date listings to service providers of all kinds are saving people time and making resources easier to find.</p>
<p>When you have something that&#8217;s helping authors so much, you naturally want to share it with as many  people as you can.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where you come in.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve set aside a limited number of free review copies and I want to give them all away. I&#8217;ve often counseled authors that one of the best ways to build the buzz around their book is by giving away copies to people who will help promote the book.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;d like to review the Resource Guide, I&#8217;d like to give you one of those free copies before they run out.</p>
<p>Just fill out the simple form below to get started:<br />
(If you&#8217;re having any difficulty with the form, you can also complete it here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sarAPx52zblnxVk5tPM0scXUhmTzCcj6CkCW9XPV-e8/viewform?c=0&#038;w=1" target="_blank">SPURG Reviewer Request</a>.)</p>
<p>It only takes a minute.</p>
<p>And thanks for your help.</p>

<h3>What People Are Saying</h3>
<p>Here are some early reviews of the <em>Resource Guide</em> from industry professionals:</p>
<p>&#8220;An essential reference to the best publishing resources for every self published author. Highly recommended!&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<strong>Mark Coker</strong>, Smashwords founder</p>
<p>&#8220;Most authors are excited about the promise of self-publishing&#8211;until they actually try to do it. Then they quickly realize they will need a team of professionals to prepare, publish, and promote their book. And that&#8217;s where they get stuck. They don&#8217;t have the connections. That&#8217;s where <em>The Self-Publisher&#8217;s Ultimate Resource Guide</em> is a life-saver. This is the missing link that will enable authors to capitalize on the self-publishing revolution and become captains of their own literary destiny. I highly recommend it.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<strong>Michael Hyatt</strong>, New York Times Bestselling Author and Former CEO, Thomas Nelson Publishers</p>
<p>&#8220;Independent authors need a team to help create a fantastic finished product, and finding the right people can be a challenge when you first start out. This book will help authors to locate professionals to edit, publish and market their work&#8211;helping them to stand out in the crowded marketplace.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<strong>Joanna Penn</strong>, The Creative Penn<br />

<h3>e-Book Cover Design Award Winner for December 2014 in Fiction</h3>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">James Egan</font> submitted <strong>The Blood of Brothers</strong> designed by James T. Egan of Bookfly Design.<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blood-Brothers-Sycamore-Moon-Book-ebook/dp/B00OUIJXYM/?tag=marinbo-20"><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Blood-Brothers.x300-200x300.png" alt="ebook cover design" width="200" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-35423" /></a><br />
<img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ECDA-Fiction-Dec-2014.png" alt="ebook cover design" width="230" height="199" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35424" /></p>
<p><strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Attracts the eye and won&#8217;t let go. You can almost physically sense the pent up energy, and the hint of menace only makes it more attractive. Strong impact and a direct message make this a winner. (The &#8220;Sycamore Moon&#8221; is series branding.)</p>
<h3>e-Book Cover Design Award Winner for December 2014 in Nonfiction</h3>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Dane Low</font> submitted <strong>How Schopenhauer Got Me Through My Mid Life Crisis</strong> designed by Dane &amp; Brittany at EbookLaunch.com.<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Schopenhauer-Through-Mid-Life-Crisis-ebook/dp/B00QXNB5PC/?tag=marinbo-20"><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Schopenhauer-300x-188x300.png" alt="ebook cover design" width="188" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-35420" /></a><br />
<img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ECA-Non-Fiction-Dec-2014.png" alt="ebook cover design" width="230" height="199" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35421" /><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Love the way the designer has brought all the elements on this cover into a vibrant whole including title, art, and background. Combining energy and humor makes this cover magnetic.</p>
<h3>Fiction Covers</h3>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Aimee Alexander</font> submitted <strong>Pause to Rewind</strong> designed by Design For Writers. &#8220;The design is very personal to the author. The little boy on the cover is her son. The design began with that photograph. Initial cover drafts were good. Then, one day, the designer went one step further, turning the b/w pic to sepia and adding the swirly design at the top.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Pause-to-rewind.jpg" alt="Pause to Rewind" title="Pause to Rewind" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A beautiful and sensitive cover sure to intrigue readers, and the carefully controlled colors help. Please credit the designer by name when possible.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Alastair Pack</font> submitted <strong>Quentin Cundick and The Web of Machinations</strong> designed by Andrea Orlic. &#8220;I requested designs on website 99Designs. A Croatian, Andrea Orlic, of Artrocity, won the competition. The book is a madcap comedy and the title and bold colours hopefully represent the fun within, as do the story elements shown: the bin-dwelling tramp, badger, female spy, etc.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Quentin-Cundick-and-The-Web-of-Machinations.jpg" alt="Quentin Cundick and The Web of Machinations" title="Quentin Cundick and The Web of Machinations" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>An interesting and appropriate visual treatment, not sure the typography measures up though.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Amanda DeWees</font> submitted <strong>Nocturne for a Widow</strong> designed by James T. Egan of Bookfly Design. &#8220;I decided to rebrand my historical romantic suspense novels and asked James for something with crossover and even literary appeal that would work well at thumbnail size. He did a brilliant job of creating a distinctive look that captures the mood and Victorian-era setting.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Nocturne-for-a-Widow.jpg" alt="Nocturne for a Widow" title="Nocturne for a Widow" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A beautiful concept, beautifully executed, with fine detail as in many of the covers by this designer. I wonder whether the very delicate title will still be visible at postage-stamp sizes.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Amy Kuivalainen</font> submitted <strong>Cry of the Firebird</strong> designed by Scarlett Rugers Design.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Cry-of-the-Firebird.jpg" alt="Cry of the Firebird" title="Cry of the Firebird" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Appealing, although I find the title a bit fussy, and I&#8217;m not sure that the ornamented rules add anything at all.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Anette Pollner</font> submitted <strong>Monsoon Midnights</strong> designed by Jaran Lakkanawat and Arthawit Pundrikapa.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Monsoon-Midnights.jpg" alt="Monsoon Midnights" title="Monsoon Midnights" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A magical look that really works for this rather monochromatic design. Not sure I would have used such a &#8220;corporate&#8221; typeface for the title, it seems to be working against the other elements.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Angelie Stahlnecker</font> submitted <strong>Alpha Mission</strong> designed by Angelie Stahlnecker. &#8220;The cover was created using a photo purchased (with full rights) from www.freedigitalphotos.net for the background. I designed the logo and layout myself.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Alpha-Mission.jpg" alt="Alpha Mission" title="Alpha Mission" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A good effort, but the multiple layers (type, logo, clouds, image in the clouds) right in the center add some confusion.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Artemis Greenleaf</font> submitted <strong>Exit Point</strong> designed by Alicia Richardson. &#8220;This is a story about a girl who has a near death experience after falling into a pool and drowning. Whether she lives or dies depends on the outcome of her astral mission. I wanted to convey that while she was in the pool, she had an equal chance of living or dying.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Exit-Point.jpg" alt="Exit Point" title="Exit Point" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Doesn&#8217;t work for me, I could barely make out the skeleton image that&#8217;s crucial to the message, and the typography is simply brutal.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Ashley R. Carlson</font> submitted <strong>The Charismatics</strong> designed by M.S. Corley. &#8220;M.S. Corley designed the cover to replicate an old, ancient red book that plays a role in my YA steampunk fantasy novel, &#8220;The Charismatics.&#8221; The floating city has meaning, as well as the 3 triangles (a government insignia). Utterly fantastic, and I&#8217;ve heard great things from authors &amp; readers alike!&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-Charismatics.jpg" alt="The Charismatics" title="The Charismatics" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>The covers for steampunk novels are some of the most interesting because of the creativity behind the ornamentation used on many of them. Here, there&#8217;s a lot of delicacy to accompany the distinctive type.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Azaria Frost</font> submitted <strong>Whore of Babylon</strong> designed by Azaria Frost. &#8220;The book is set in ancient Sumeria / Babylon, and centres on a strikingly beautiful young woman.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Whore-of-Babylon.jpg" alt="Whore of Babylon" title="Whore of Babylon" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>This would have worked better if the image of the woman was lighter, and there was a more practiced hand behind the type, which just looks lost.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Belinda Pollard</font> submitted <strong>Poison Bay</strong> designed by Belinda Pollard. &#8220;We wanted to convey a sinister feel and a dangerous natural environment, while following the current trend to include human figures. The cover also needed impact in thumbnail size while remaining classy (and LS printable) in 6 x 9 trade paperback size.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Poison-Bay.jpg" alt="Poison Bay" title="Poison Bay" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A near-perfect ebook cover that has great balance, drama, and a clear hook into the story. Very accomplished for a cover by an author.<font color="gold"><font size="+1"> &#9733; </font></font><br />
<span id="more-35386"></span></p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Benjamin Wende</font> submitted <strong>Expensive Taste</strong> designed by Benjamin Wende. &#8220;A new title for the same old story. Thanks for your time.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Expensive-Taste.jpg" alt="Expensive Taste" title="Expensive Taste" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Visually confusing, and with a clear mismatch between the title font and the image.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Benjamin Wende</font> submitted <strong>The &#8220;Sweetest&#8221; Sin</strong> designed by Benjamin Wende. &#8220;As a beginner, I have a lot to learn from you. I am all ears. Cheers for your time and opportunity.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-Sweetest-Sin.jpg" alt="The "Sweetest" Sin" title="The "Sweetest" Sin" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Okay, I&#8217;ll try. There&#8217;s no need for the quotation marks in the title; the font you&#8217;re using is reminiscent of the old west, although the book is modern. It also implies an outdoor life, completely at odds with the roses. And the black background looks ready to swallow everything else.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Bonnie Ferrante</font> submitted <strong>Bouquet: Short Stories with a Buddhist Scent</strong> designed by Bonnie Ferrante. &#8220;SF and fantasy stories with Buddhist themes.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Bouquet-Short-Stories-with-a-Buddhist-Scent.jpg" alt="Bouquet: Short Stories with a Buddhist Scent" title="Bouquet: Short Stories with a Buddhist Scent" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Cool, might have to get this one. The image is interesting, but all the type needs help. The title is whispering, and the fonts don&#8217;t really match very well.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Bonnie Ferrante</font> submitted <strong>Leya</strong> designed by Bonnie Ferrante. &#8220;In a world where eye color may determine your future, Leya is born with one green and one blue eye.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Leya.jpg" alt="Leya" title="Leya" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I could just repeat the comment from your other cover above. Authors might consider working <em>with</em> a designer until they learn more about how to use type.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Bonnie Ferrante</font> submitted <strong>Terror at White Otter Castle</strong> designed by Bonnie Ferrante. &#8220;A campy suspense in the tone of 1950s horror comics.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Terror-at-White-Otter-Castle.jpg" alt="Terror at White Otter Castle" title="Terror at White Otter Castle" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Bizarre and off-putting, alongside the dreaded &#8220;pasted together&#8221; look.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Brandon Zenner</font> submitted <strong>The Experiment of Dreams</strong> designed by James goon write.com.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-Experiment-of-Dreams.jpg" alt="The Experiment of Dreams" title="The Experiment of Dreams" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Clever and carefully constructed.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Caroline Kaiser</font> submitted <strong>Virginia&#8217;s Ghost</strong> designed by Scarlett Rugers. &#8220;Designer Scarlett Rugers was aiming to capture a sense of nostalgia and mystery with the design for Virginia&#8217;s Ghost. Inspired by silent movie star Louise Brooks, the cover began with an ethereal image of a flapper to which glamorous typography and elegant deco-style borders were added.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Virginias-Ghost.jpg" alt="Virginia's Ghost" title="Virginia's Ghost" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A gorgeous and beautifully disciplined cover, in which the designer focuses our eye on the ghostly figure at the center. Great choices all around.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Charles Bruner</font> submitted <strong>The Janus Theory</strong> designed by Ty C. Simmons. &#8220;I have always been interested in Janus the Roman God, who represents a theory of looking at your past to see the mistakes you made and then use that knowledge to fashion your future. The obvious thing to do was to use the symbol of Janus which is 2 faces, one looking forward &amp; one looking backwards&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-Janus-Theory.jpg" alt="The Janus Theory" title="The Janus Theory" width="200" /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">CHERYL MACKEY</font> submitted <strong>The Unknown Sun</strong> designed by Victoria at WhitandWare.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-Unknown-Sun.jpg" alt="The Unknown Sun" title="The Unknown Sun" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Lovely.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Christophe Adrien</font> submitted <strong>We, The Network</strong> designed by Derek Toigo.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/We-The-Network.jpg" alt="We, The Network" title="We, The Network" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I like the layered look and faint air of menace conveyed by this cover, although using a different color for each line of type is distracting.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Christopher Joyce</font> submitted <strong>The Creatures of Chichester</strong> designed by Jane Dixon Smith. &#8220;Jane has designed a very eye catching brand that works well across all three books in the series. Six are planned and I look forward to future covers that work well as a thumbnail and also in print. Strong typography and clear titles work well.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-Creatures-of-Chichester.jpg" alt="The Creatures of Chichester" title="The Creatures of Chichester" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Some of the type needs work, like the word that appears to be &#8220;doud&#8221; and the font used for the author&#8217;s name, which needs either replacing or letter spacing.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Cinda C. MacKinnon</font> submitted <strong>A Place in the World</strong> designed by Adriane Bosworth. The artwork is by Martin J.Heade; I love it because I feel it begins the story before you&#8217;ve read the first page. A. Bosworth designed the layout.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/A-Place-in-the-World.jpg" alt="A Place in the World" title="A Place in the World" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Is the story about birds? A fine eye for color and careful composition, although I&#8217;m wondering why the author has decided to treat her name as something to be worked out from the complex typography it uses.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Connie Chastain</font> submitted <strong>Love in Smallfoot Alley</strong> designed by Connie Chastain. &#8220;Smallfoot Alley is an area of rural Chatahoula County in Alabama known for infrequent sightings of Bigfoot-like cryptids, except they&#8217;re less than five feet tall, and thus are known as the Smallfoot. The road on the cover is the location of a Smallfoot sighting that opens the story.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Love-in-Smallfoot-Alley.jpg" alt="Love in Smallfoot Alley" title="Love in Smallfoot Alley" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Love that visual, it really draws you in and warns you at the same time, but the one discordant note is the word &#8220;Love&#8221; in the title.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Cora Graphics</font> submitted <strong>Armageddon</strong> designed by Cora Graphics.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Armageddon.jpg" alt="Armageddon" title="Armageddon" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Interesting type, although the rest of the cover looks a bit generic.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Corey Furman</font> submitted <strong>The Way of All Flesh</strong> designed by Mike Moss. &#8220;A small committee of personal (but highly professional) friends worked on the concept and Mike brought it to life. We went through a few iterations, but this was a standout in the pack.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-Way-of-All-Flesh.jpg" alt="The Way of All Flesh" title="The Way of All Flesh" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Glad I didn&#8217;t get to see the rest. This one just defeats me. &#8220;The Way of All Flesh&#8221;? Seriously? Maybe I&#8217;ll call my next book &#8220;Remembrance of Things Past.&#8221; No, maybe &#8220;Paradise Lost.&#8221; The images clearly don&#8217;t belong together and make little sense, and the added-in eye color on the guy in the corner is so obviously fake it makes you suspect this is a parody of some kind. Unless that&#8217;s the effect you were going for, I suggest hiring one of the talented designers whose work you see in this post.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Cynthia D. Witherspoon</font> submitted <strong>The Fanatic</strong> designed by Mika Hearn. &#8220;Image is credited to: Cover art:  Portrait #8 by Erfi Anugrah; edited for cover use by Mika Hearn.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Don&#8217;t understand how the bottom half is connected to the top half.</p>

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Unmistakably self-published. Putting type on top of a photo does not a cover make.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Dan Walsh</font> submitted <strong>When Night Comes</strong> designed by Damonza.com. &#8220;Just want to plug Damon and his art team. I verbally shared the concept I had in mind, and was so pleased to see this cover as part of the 3 designs they sent me, within a few days of signing up with them. We just tweaked a few things, and we were there.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/When-Night-Comes.jpg" alt="When Night Comes" title="When Night Comes" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Plug away. It kind of gives you the shivers just looking at it.</p>

<p><font color="darkred">Dane Low</font> submitted <strong>Feast of Fates</strong> designed by Dane &amp; Brittany at EbookLaunch.com. &#8220;Book one of this series&#8221;<br />

<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Dane Low</font> submitted <strong>Max&#8217;s Revenge</strong> designed by Dane, Brittany and Sophia at EbookLaunch.com. &#8220;Book one of this children&#8217;s adventure series.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Maxs-Revenge.jpg" alt="Max's Revenge" title="Max's Revenge" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>This whole series (see the next two covers) is delightful and nicely targeted to the middle-school crowd. Great color combinations and amusing illustrations create a classic brand look.<font color="gold"><font size="+1"> &#9733; </font></font></p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Dane Low</font> submitted <strong>Outback Hero</strong> designed by Dane, Brittany and Sophia at EbookLaunch.com. &#8220;Book two of this children&#8217;s adventure series.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Clever and artful, it drew me right in; I couldn&#8217;t stop looking at the title in the tree, and gradually the other elements seeped into consciousness.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Danielle Soucy Mills</font> submitted <strong>Illusion of an Ending: A novel</strong> designed by Mae I Design. &#8220;I imagined my cover to be a woman looking out at the ocean with her son&#8217;s spirit surrounding her. My friend&#8217;s mother graciously donated this photo of herself, the first time she had returned to her and her son&#8217;s favorite spot on the water, a year after his passing. Cover design by Regina Wamba.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Very sensitive and affecting. All the elements are well matched to the content.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Denise Drespling</font> submitted <strong>Winter Wishes</strong> designed by Denise Drespling. &#8220;I designed this cover for an anthology of winter stories (that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s no author name).&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Winter-Wishes.jpg" alt="Winter Wishes" title="Winter Wishes" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Obviously a skilled design, but that big flare in the corner really bothers my eye and pulls me away from the message the cover is trying to communicate.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Dexter Price</font> submitted <strong>The Chronicles of Fire and Ice: The Revealing</strong> designed by Najla Qamber. &#8220;The faces: My story is told through the eyes of two friends so that is why half a face of each is on the cover. NYC: is in the background for the location. Fire/Ice: because each one of my main characters has an ability to control one of the elements.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-Chronicles-of-Fire-and-Ice.jpg" alt="The Chronicles of Fire and Ice: The Revealing" title="The Chronicles of Fire and Ice: The Revealing" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A strong concept, and effective. The colon (&#8220;:&#8221;) on the end of the title is superfluous and should be removed, and the subtitle is almost unreadable, something that can be fixed quite easily.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Donna Joy</font> submitted <strong>Tangible Illusions</strong> designed by Donna Joy. &#8220;Tangible Illusions takes the reader on a journey of emotions through seven poems and a short story. The works deal with loss and loneliness. The picture is from Unsplash.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tangible-Illusions.jpg" alt="Tangible Illusions" title="Tangible Illusions" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>What works is the simplicity and restraint, good qualities when you&#8217;re not a professional. There are some spacing problems with the type, but overall it works even if it&#8217;s a bit vanilla.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">ED FRIERSON</font> submitted <strong>FLUTTER! Wisdom For Living, Loving, Dying</strong> designed by Christopher Darling. &#8220;The cover features original, hand-drawn, butterfly wings having species integrity. It replicates the cover of main character Casey&#8217;s wisdom revealing &#8220;Bug Book.&#8221; The compelling cover wonder fills a dramatic scene when the notebook unexpectedly appears for the first time&#8230;at Casey&#8217;s memorial.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Flutter.jpg" alt="FLUTTER! Wisdom For Living, Loving, Dying" title="FLUTTER! Wisdom For Living, Loving, Dying" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I&#8217;m sure people who buy and read this book will be very happy to see the story reflected in the cover. However, in general we design covers for those people who <em>haven&#8217;t</em> read it yet, and the problem I have with this cover, pretty though it is, is that it&#8217;s hard to make out what I&#8217;m looking at at a small size and I&#8217;m not sure why I&#8217;m supposed to be interested. By the way, your subtitle seems to belong on a self-help book, not a novel.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Elizabeth Maddrey</font> submitted <strong>Kinsale Kisses</strong> designed by Lynellen Perry.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Kinsale-Kisses.jpg" alt="Kinsale Kisses" title="Kinsale Kisses" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Awkward. The images seem to fighting each other, not combining, and the white band between is like a no-man&#8217;s-land.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Gene Bathurst</font> submitted <strong>Magnum Thrax and the Amusement Park of Doom</strong> designed by Gene Bathurst. &#8220;Wanted something that was loud and clear when a teeny tiny thumbnail.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Magnum-Thrax-and-the-Amusement-Park-of-Doom.jpg" alt="Magnum Thrax and the Amusement Park of Doom" title="Magnum Thrax and the Amusement Park of Doom" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>You&#8217;re almost there. But there are simply too many figures, at too great a distance. Great illustration style, but I would &#8220;zoom&#8221; in so we can really engage with them.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Georgina Titmus</font> submitted <strong>Chicken Nugget Run!</strong> designed by Georgina Titmus. &#8220;e-published under my pseudonym Ali Aardwolff &#8211; I designed this cover combining my own artwork with the technical assistance of Powerpoint.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Chicken-Nugget-Run.jpg" alt="Chicken Nugget Run!" title="Chicken Nugget Run!" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>But what does it all mean? And why do we have a font right out of the Renaissance along with Comic Sans (or one of it&#8217;s imitators)?</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Grayer Vaughan</font> submitted <strong>The Silent Violent Few</strong> designed by Grayer Vaughan. &#8220;The cover design was inspired by the submissive pose that a character, Frankie aka Dandelion, does in the book. This is a pivotal scene that was able to be captured and placed on the book cover to represent the tone of the book. The rope corset is a reflection of the struggle she experiences.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-Silent-Violent-Few.jpg" alt="The Silent Violent Few" title="The Silent Violent Few" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A lesson: when you use an image of this sexy, exotic woman with overtones of bondage and slavery, please don&#8217;t pick a font that belongs on an invitation to a Valentine&#8217;s Day party.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Grier Cooper</font> submitted <strong>WISH: Indigo Dreams Series #1</strong> designed by LJ Anderson, Mayhem Cover Creations. &#8220;Original photo of ballet dancer © Grier Cooper (author)&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I like the colors in this cover, but I can&#8217;t help but wonder how much more impact it would have if that big mirror thing was eliminated, allowing the ballerina to stand out.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Hanna James</font> submitted <strong>Nola</strong> designed by Hanna James. &#8220;The client/author Giliak Hobson wanted a book cover that emphasized his main character as a woman warrior saving her young child, with a design that&#8217;s clear in thumbnail. Fantasy genre.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Nola.jpg" alt="Nola" title="Nola" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Although I like the title and background, it&#8217;s hard to see how that font (does it take place in New Orleans?) belongs on a cover with a woman holding a sword and dressed in armor. They just don&#8217;t work together well.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Heatherly Bell</font> submitted <strong>Somebody Like You</strong> designed by Kim Killion.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Somebody-like-you.jpg" alt="Somebody Like You" title="Somebody Like You" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>An example of a designer who knows exactly what genre readers are looking for, and gives it to them. Lovely title treatment.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Iacopo Cavicchini</font> submitted <strong>Il Portale -Le Radici</strong> designed by Saverio Cavicchini. &#8220;The cover shows the characteristic eyes of one of the character looking directly to the reader. The book is the first of a saga, we tried to comunicate this whit the typo. &#8220;Il Portale&#8221; is the saga title,&#8221;Le Radici&#8221; the book title. At the bottom you can see a logo, like a publishing house one.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Il-Portale-Le-Radici.jpg" alt="Il Portale -Le Radici" title="Il Portale -Le Radici" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>The illustration is quite interesting, the type is weak, and publishers rarely put their logos on the front cover of their books.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Ioana Visan</font> submitted <strong>Broken People</strong> designed by Cristina Birtea. &#8220;The prosthetic arm belongs to the Golden Lady, one of the main characters in the novel, and the pattern on the sphere is meant to imply she holds the fate of the whole world in her hand. The illustrator drew exactly what I asked her, so if anything doesn&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s on me.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Broken-People.jpg" alt="Broken People" title="Broken People" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Nothing wrong with the illustration, but the title&#8217;s been bullied into a corner, and its color is fighting with the very similar color of  the illustration.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Ioana Visan</font> submitted <strong>The Nightingale Circus</strong> designed by Cristina Birtea. &#8220;The Nightingale Circus is a prequel to Broken People. The circus crew builds and repairs prosthetics as a side business, so I wanted the illustration to intrigue and invite the reader in. The illustrator drew exactly what I asked her, so if anything doesn&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s on me.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>This one works much better, and the illustration is quite dramatic and inviting.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">J. Zachary Pike</font> submitted <strong>Orconomics: A Satire</strong> designed by J. Zachary Pike. &#8220;Orconomics: A Satire pokes at the economy and corporate culture through the lens of a high fantasy epic, so the cover blends an Orc with design elements associated with a $5 bill.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Although the &#8220;engraving&#8221; of the orc and the bill details is obviously very skillful, this doesn&#8217;t, in the end, really look much like a book cover.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">James Duprie</font> submitted <strong>The Leopard Rider</strong> designed by Dave Fymbo from Limelightbookcovers. &#8220;Title relates to a character in this historical fiction novel.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Simple but effective. A bit too much black for my taste.</p>

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Great texture throughout this design, and the concentric circles focus right on the window into the action.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">James T Kelly</font> submitted <strong>The Fey Man</strong> designed by Annah Wootten-Pinéles. &#8220;I thought a stained glass design could be both beautiful and eye-catching. Both the dragon and the tower are from a pivotal scene in the book, but Annah must take all the credit for turning those elements into such a striking image.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-Fey-Man.jpg" alt="The Fey Man" title="The Fey Man" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>It&#8217;s a striking image, would like to see the type a little stronger to achieve a better balance.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Janet Bond</font> submitted <strong>Eleventh Elementum (The Primortus Chronicles Book1)</strong> designed by Deranged Doctor Designer, MARUSHKA. &#8220;This YA Fantasy/Adventure cover features the main character Sky Porter, holding her magical necklace called the Elementum. We asked Deranged Doctor Design for a spectacular sky in the background (a play on our main characters name) and a youthful girl in movement.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Eleventh-Elementum.jpg" alt="Eleventh Elementum (The Primortus Chronicles Book1)" title="Eleventh Elementum (The Primortus Chronicles Book1)" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Some nice atmosphere. Notice how the extemely active type treatment of the title is the most visually energetic part of the cover.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Janet Bond</font> submitted <strong>Hollowed Humusara (The Primortus Chronicles Book 2)</strong> designed by Deranged Doctor Designer, MARUSHKA. &#8220;For the second book in this YA fantasy/adventure series we wanted a feeling of intensity and action. Sky Porter&#8217;s magical book called the Humusara is in danger of losing its pages in a Hollowing ceremony performed by the powerful Primortus Council.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I think this one works better than the first. You can see how the type treatment of the title is being used as a branding element as well.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jay W Curry</font> submitted <strong>Nixon and Dovey, The Legend Returns</strong> designed by Radosław Krawczyk. &#8220;Set in antebellum South. Nixon, young, lived with the indians (his dress), jockey (the horse). Dovey, Nixon&#8217;s love interest, quintessential beautiful, spoiled Southern politician&#8217;s daughter thus the mansion and her dress. Nixon was condemned to hang for Negro stealing thus the black man and noose&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Strong story elements combined with artful type and image compositing create a good looking cover.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jayde Blumenthal</font> submitted <strong>Miri&#8217;s Hot Challah: A grownup Jewish bedtime story</strong> designed by self &#8211; KD Cover Pro templates. &#8220;This is the first in the series of short stories. The heroine needed to look somewhat Jewish and I wanted an image of bread in the background, even though this story is primarily about how Miri acts out her desire through the bread. Tough call &#8211; hard to create a cover for Orthodox Jewish erotica.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Miris-Hot-Challah.jpg" alt="Miri's Hot Challah: A grownup Jewish bedtime story" title="Miri's Hot Challah: A grownup Jewish bedtime story" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Shows both the advantages and disadvantages of &#8220;template&#8221; book covers. While you don&#8217;t have to worry about it looking very amateurish, it may not suit your book that well either. I&#8217;ve never seen a challah with seeds on it, creating a bit of dissonance.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jenny B. Jones</font> submitted <strong>A Sugar Creek Christmas</strong> designed by Kelli Standish. &#8220;For this cover, we wanted to capture the small town, Southern setting, the warmth of the holidays, and a slightly differently look for the typical couple on the cover.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/A-Sugar-Creek-Christmas.jpg" alt="A Sugar Creek Christmas" title="A Sugar Creek Christmas" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A workable genre cover that does what it has to do.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jenny B. Jones</font> submitted <strong>Can&#8217;t Let You Go</strong> designed by Kelli Standish. &#8220;Can&#8217;t Let You Go is a New Adult romance, but we wanted to try something a little different and break from trend for the cover.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Not exactly sure which trends you&#8217;re bucking here, since this looks like a perfectly acceptable genre cover. The luggage tags let us know there&#8217;s some travel, and the couple tell us everything else we need to know.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jim Carson</font> submitted <strong>A Chasing After The Wind</strong> designed by Damonza. &#8220;The green shamrock is symbolic of the rich Irish heritage that runs through the veins of the main characters. The gold lettering represents the deleterious wealth exchanged between all the characters, and the blowing grass, stormy clouds against the black skies, follows the storyline of the title.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>The type&#8217;s somewhat overworked for me, but you can&#8217;t fault the composition or the care that went into this cover.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jo Michaels</font> submitted <strong>Fractured Glass &#8211; A Novel Anthology</strong> designed by Jo Michaels. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been working on my typography comfort level. I designed this cover for this new kind of young adult science fiction novel. 5 authors, 1 story. We&#8217;ve gotten many compliments on the cover, and I&#8217;m curious what you think, Joel. Including all the names was a challenge. Thanks for the opportunity!&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I think the names are handled well, although I usually avoid fonts this fussy. The problem I&#8217;m having is with the very bright highlight behind the title that&#8217;s rendering it somewhat hard to read, and I find that distracting.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">John T O&#8217;Halloran</font> submitted <strong>The Second Conflict</strong> designed by Niall Conlon. &#8220;The Sword passes throug a pentagram, the seal of \the Magii, representing the four elements and Spirit. These swords were were forged from the ore that came from The Mines of The Moon &amp; were doused in the blood of The Fallen Angels&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Another example that shows how an amateur designer&#8217;s best friend is simplicity. Although the title is a bit quiet, overall the cover works.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Josefina Gutierrez</font> submitted <strong>The Shadow of Loss</strong> designed by BookBaby. &#8220;The cover of my e-book, The Shadow Loss, depicts two best friends finding peace after loss. Their faces are faded to focus on the background.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-Shadow-of-Loss.jpg" alt="The Shadow of Loss" title="The Shadow of Loss" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Not very good, I&#8217;m afraid. What&#8217;s the point of blurring the most interesting element on the cover in order to focus on some leaves? And the title is lacking in contrast.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jūratė Žukauskaitė</font> submitted <strong>Boris Goes to the Supermarket</strong> designed by Julija Linkutė, Jūratė Žukauskaitė. &#8220;The cover perfectly reflects the mood of the novel. The weary pursuit towards love and happiness and the touching human (and ursine) warmth are juxtaposed against the alienating bleakness of a generic Eastern European city, where going to a supermarket becomes a dark and humorous fairy-tail.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Boris-Goes-to-the-Supermarket.jpg" alt="Boris Goes to the Supermarket" title="Boris Goes to the Supermarket" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>There&#8217;s some charm in the loose style, but not sure why you are pointing the reader towards what appears to be a smokestack?</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Justice Joy</font> submitted <strong>Straight and True: A Regency Novella</strong> designed by Stephanie Mooney at Mooney Designs.<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>An expertly assembled cover for a historical romance, it&#8217;s got real appeal.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Katharina Gerlach</font> submitted <strong>The Dwarf and the Twins (Treasures Retold #1)</strong> designed by myself. &#8220;The other covers in the series follow the same concept (black silhouettes against a blue sky)&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-Dwarf-and-the-Twins.jpg" alt="The Dwarf and the Twins (Treasures Retold #1)" title="The Dwarf and the Twins (Treasures Retold #1)" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I can see a lot of work went into this cover, which is why it&#8217;s a shame that it&#8217;s so visually confusing. The silhouettes aren&#8217;t really against the sky, they are contained within inverted silhouettes, a tough challenge for anyone. On top of that, I can see that the silhouette on the right is a bearded man inside a girl&#8217;s head, but what the heck is the other one? And I&#8217;m totally lost as to what the large black shape is supposed to be. One word: simplify.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Kathrese McKee</font> submitted <strong>Mardan&#8217;s Mark</strong> designed by Robin Ludwig. &#8220;The color palette, imagery, and composition of Robin’s design beckons readers into the danger and intrigue of this Young Adult adventure fantasy. She integrated a medallion with the mark into the design, serving as a brand for the series.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Nicely atmospheric and well put together.</p>

<p><font color="darkred">Ken Preston</font> submitted <strong>Joe Coffin</strong> designed by Patrick Fox. &#8220;Joe Coffin is a horror novel, with lots of blood.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Oh really? The type here looks out of balance, with the title both too low and too small to properly balance the type at the top and bottom of the cover.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Ken Preston</font> submitted <strong>The Devil and Edward Teach</strong> designed by Patrick Fox. &#8220;The Devil and Edward Teach is a tale of pirates and the supernatural.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Cool graphics, hard to read title. What do all those effects really add? Whatever it is, it&#8217;s the opposite of design.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Kim DDD</font> submitted <strong>Game Theory</strong> designed by Kitten from Deranged Doctor Design. &#8220;Cover re-design of Women Suspense &#8220;Game Theory&#8221; by Colleen Cross.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Cleverly constructed, this is an impressive ebook cover. Notice that even though the cityscape at the very bottom is quite small, it still adds to the information we get from a glance at the cover, and the vast size differences here add to the tension of the whole design.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Kim DDD</font> submitted <strong>Kizuna Coast (A Rei Shimura Mystery book 11)</strong> designed by Kitten from Deranged Doctor Design. &#8220;Cover redesign and branding of Women Mystery series &#8220;Rei Shimura Mystery&#8221; set in Japan.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Expertly designed series covers (see the one below) that do what they are supposed to: strongly brand the series while giving enough story detail and human interaction to draw us right in.</p>

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I love the way these colors work together and complement the careful typography.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Kirsten Binder</font> submitted <strong>Release</strong> designed by Lindsay Megahed. &#8220;This ethereal, original artwork&#8217;s incomplete-seeming, almost hasty swaths of pinks and blues grows more complex as it is examined, perfectly suiting the novel&#8217;s subject matter. &#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I can see how artful the illustration is, but can you see how awfully difficult it is to evaluate this as a book cover, since it&#8217;s completely bleeding onto the background of the page? Please resubmit this cover with a border around it (even a light gray one would do), thanks.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Kody Dibble</font> submitted <strong>Gauntlets of Rage</strong> designed by Su Halwerk. &#8220;This is a poetry collection I recently published.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>If you want to use a brutally strong element like this chain, put it on the left of the cover, not the right. Here you are directing us to the spine, not where the book opens (the right). Type leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">L.G. O&#8217;Connor</font> submitted <strong>The Wanderer&#8217;s Children</strong> designed by Derek Murphy at CreativIndie. &#8220;This is the second book of the series and carries some similar elements throughout.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A very dull image will usually not make a good ebook cover, and if your type is over a black background, try a different color than dark red.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Lily Bishop</font> submitted <strong>Under His Protection</strong> designed by TugboatDesign.net. &#8220;We used the city background for this book to tie the series together. Each story takes place in a different city, from Las Vegas to Miami to Atlanta.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Identity crisis: is it a romance (from the font chosen for the title) or a mystery or thriller (from the figure with the gun and the cityscape)? No idea. And the white corner looks a bit like a mistake, as if something was supposed to go there.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Lindsey Forrest</font> submitted <strong>All Who Are Lost</strong> designed by Robin Ludwig, Robin Ludwig Design. &#8220;I felt that Robin found a photo where the model conveyed a sense of loneliness and loss.&#8221;<br />

<p><font color="darkred">M.L. Gardner</font> submitted <strong>1929: Book One</strong> designed by The Thatchery. &#8220;The cover was designed by The Thatchery for the rerelease of my book 1929: Book One of The 1929 Series.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>It can be hard to combine more than two images and end up with a cohesive look, but this cover succeeds, and part of that is the careful color decisions and the mood that&#8217;s so well expressed.

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Billed as a &#8220;YA apocalyptic adventure&#8221; this title/cover combo is dynamite. You&#8217;ve got the story, and the intrigue, right in front of you, inviting you in.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Margaret Lesh</font> submitted <strong>Mr. Katz is a Zombie</strong> designed by Steven Lesh. &#8220;This lower middle grade book is designed for readers age 8 to 12. Because of the book&#8217;s humorous bent&#8211;think The Hardy Boys meets Ghostbusters&#8211;I wanted the cover to have more of a fun cartoon feel than grotesque imagery that so many of the zombie-themed books have.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>It looks like you made some great decisions here to end up with this delightful cover, but it&#8217;s quite difficult to evaluate because it&#8217;s bleeding out onto the white page, losing its identity as a book cover. Put a rule of some kind around it when you post it online.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Mark Collins</font> submitted <strong>Thicker Than Water</strong> designed by Mark C. Collins. &#8220;I am the writer (under a pen name) of this short story, I also designed and illustrated the cover.

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>You have a unique drawing style that really works on this cover. It would be even better if the title were larger, allowing it to integrate with the artwork instead of being framed by it, adding energy and interest.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Mark Steensland</font> submitted <strong>Jesus, the Christ</strong> designed by Eden Lewis. &#8220;Because we were publishing on Amazon, we wanted a cover that looked big even when it was small. This is why the sides of the letters in the title are &#8220;cut off.&#8221; We also wanted an image of Jesus outside the usual and the Durer sketch we used as the basis communicates the tragic nature of the drama.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Jesus-the-Christ.jpg" alt="Jesus, the Christ" title="Jesus, the Christ" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Nice job, and a cover that would easily transition into a theatrical poster.</p>

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>But she is so very far away, it&#8217;s hard to engage with her. And I&#8217;m sorry for whatever happened to your book title, it&#8217;s quite unfortunate.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Melinda Martin</font> submitted <strong>Peacock Swamp | The Nine</strong> designed by Melinda Martin. &#8220;Moths are an element of this story that tie in with the main character. I chose a few images of some moths and then overlapped them in the shape of a 9 and applied shading and highlighting. I then added a light effect inside the 9.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Although it&#8217;s not terrible, I&#8217;m not fond of it. The center circle indeed looks like moths ate it, and wasn&#8217;t there anything else you could think of for the background?</p>

<p><font color="darkred">Missy Meyer</font> submitted <strong>We Could Be Villains</strong> designed by Missy Meyer. &#8220;Chick lit with superheroes. I wanted something simple and bold, with a font that hints that it&#8217;s not a serious, heavy superhero book. Pink seemed too obvious for the mask, plus when the lead character wears one, it&#8217;s blue.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I think it was a strong idea, but all that white gives me an unfinished feeling. And I&#8217;m not sure your audience will recognize it as &#8220;chick lit.&#8221;</p>

<p><font color="darkred">Olivia Brown</font> submitted <strong>Just Saturday nights</strong> designed by Melody Simmons. &#8220;The title came from the novella.

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Lovely colors. You can see that designers are over-relying on silhouettes, maybe because graphically they are very easy to assemble and work with. But at some point, don&#8217;t they start to look more like voids?</p>

<p><font color="darkred">Paul Levy</font> submitted <strong>Skive</strong> designed by Kate Broadhurst. &#8220;Kate is a very talented artist.

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Okay, let&#8217;s talk about it again. There&#8217;s so much black on the covers this month. Here you can see how this simply creates a void, a lack of anything, the option taken to not decide on something, to just leave it out. In this case the effect is compounded by pushing the type out of the way so the black can really take over. Despite the attractive girl, it doesn&#8217;t work at all for me.</p>

<p><font color="darkred">Peggy Rose Soren</font> submitted <strong>Love, Money and Murder</strong> designed by pro-eBook covers 2 Fiverr. &#8220;I ,at first, designed the cover myself using my own artwork. The book didn&#8217;t sell. I turned to Fiverr for help. Angie (pro-ebook covers) was wonderful to help me . The photo is from Shutterstock.

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I guess it&#8217;s sci-fi, but it&#8217;s hard to be sure. The title font is a bizarre choice, and I have no idea what&#8217;s going on with the caped man and the floating gear. Odd.</p>

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A good job that could have used more light or better composition in the bottom image so we could recognize more easily that it&#8217;s a sail boat on the sea. The way it is, dark and running into the upper image behind the title, it&#8217;s hard to tell at first.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Ronald Walker</font> submitted <strong>Lovers Lies and Lilies</strong> designed by Ronald Walker. &#8220;Lovers Lies and Lilies. I hoped the cover would entice investigation and my small budget dictated the result.&#8221;<br />

<p><font color="darkred">Ruthanne Reid</font> submitted <strong>The Sundered</strong> designed by Ruthanne V. Reid. &#8220;I had a blast designing this. The hint that a living creature made of water has sprung from the depths is evocative, and directly applicable to the book&#8217;s theme and characters. I also love the colors; it could be peaceful and soothing, but something about it is chaotic and frightening, as well.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-Sundered.jpg" alt="The Sundered" title="The Sundered" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>When I looked at this cover enlarged, I could see everything you describe. But at this size it becomes too dark and muddied to see hardly anything at all.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Sandra Hutchison</font> submitted <strong>The Ribs and Thigh Bones of Desire</strong> designed by Damonza.com. &#8220;I went back to Damon Za, who had redesigned my cover for The Awful Mess, because I wanted a similar look despite a change in genre from women&#8217;s fiction to coming of age. I think he handled the challenge of that and the long title quite well.&#8221;<br />

<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Sarah Channing-Wright</font> submitted <strong>The Angels of Islington</strong> designed by Sarah Channing-Wright. &#8220;The concept for this cover came from combining vampires, goths and the London Underground, which is what the book is about.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Terrific, everything you want in an ebook cover: impact, a clear signal about the genre and tone of the book, and just enough edgy design to shock and hold the viewer.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Shauna Aura Knight</font> submitted <strong>Werewolves in the Kitchen</strong> designed by Shauna Aura Knight. &#8220;I went for dark earth tones when I designed the cover for this paranormal romance. While there are lighthearted moments between the threesome, there&#8217;s also danger and dark magic below the surface of the &#8220;normal.&#8221; Ellie&#8217;s introduced to this when she discovers that her two lovers are werewolves.&#8221;<br />

<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Sherri Wilson Johnson</font> submitted <strong>To Laugh Once More</strong> designed by Lynnette Bonner. &#8220;This is the cover for my second novel, To Laugh Once More. The designer is Lynnette Bonner and she&#8217;s the best at depicting the mood of the book!&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I much prefer the second of these two related covers. The color scheme is warmer and more cohesive, and the woman makes direct contact with us, where in the one above there&#8217;s definitely less human contact and a cooler overall tone.</p>

<p><font color="darkred">Stephen Arnott</font> submitted <strong>Jack Bleacher: a parody</strong> designed by GoOnWrite. &#8220;This is the cover for my latest novel &#8216;Jack Bleacher&#8217;. As you might guess, it&#8217;s a parody of the Jack Reacher books by Lee Child. It&#8217;s an off-the-peg design by James at GoOnWrite. I love the crisp image of the gun against the neutral grey. Having &#8216;parody&#8217; in black allows the title to stand alone.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>It&#8217;s a lovely photo, not sure I see any evidence of the parody in this cover, which could just as easily be a cover for a straight detective story or thriller. Am I missing something?</p>
<hr />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I know authors put a lot of time and energy into doing their own covers, but you need to be able to tell when what you have produced is not going to help your book, but instead may well hurt it. This cover falls in that unfortunate category. Hire a designer if at all possible.</p>

<p><font color="darkred">Taillefer Long</font> submitted <strong>How Washington Lost His Birthday and Other Masonic Essays</strong> designed by Taillefer Long. &#8220;Since the material was pretty varied, without a single, unifying concept, I decided to play with the title in a creative way. Although the word placement was risky, I hope it works to make it more interesting and appealing.&#8221;<br />

<p><font color="darkred">Tamara Leigh</font> submitted <strong>Stealing Adda</strong> designed by Ravven Kitsune. &#8220;I adore the look Ravven developed for the re-release of my 2006 novel, Stealing Adda, and that she beautifully carried it across all four titles in the series. I believe the image, layout, and color selection perfectly capture the story&#8217;s essence.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>And it&#8217;s lovely, I&#8217;m just wondering about why the entire focus of the cover is pointing toward the girl&#8217;s foot? Are we meant to be staring at her shoe?</p>

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I just don&#8217;t know what to say. Does it look like a book cover for a coming of age novel? And an appropriate time for this: &#8220;What were they thinking?&#8221;</p>

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Nice concept but a boring and confused result. The strong horizontal bands don&#8217;t help, since they are fighting with the central image for preeminence.</p>
<h3>Nonfiction Covers</h3>

<p><font color="darkred">Allison Moon</font> submitted <strong>Bad Dyke</strong> designed by Allison Moon. &#8220;A bit risque, yes, but I&#8217;m hoping you&#8217;ll see the inspiration I took from John Kacere&#8217;s paintings, and Sophia Coppola&#8217;s &#8220;Lost In Translation&#8221; for this sex memoir.&#8221;<br />

<p><font color="darkred">Cappy Love Hanson</font> submitted <strong>Love Life, with Parrots</strong> designed by Joleene Naylor. &#8220;Love Life, with Parrots chronicles my romantic misadventures in search of my life partner, and my growing flock of intelligent, affectionate, and unpredictable parrots&#8211;my little knights in feathered armor. It&#8217;s mostly serious memoir. The feathers lent just the right touch to the cover.&#8221;<br />

<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Clay Rivers</font> submitted <strong>The Raindancer: Finding Joy in the Storm</strong> designed by Clay Rivers. &#8220;This book is about a family-man&#8217;s battle with colon and lung cancer. In the same manner that he chose to transform an unsightly surgery into a fun topic of conversation by donning Hawaiian shirts, I sought to wrap a potentially joyless book in a lighthearted cover.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Visually coherent and with a lot of appeal, strong typography, and a lovely background texture, although the generic subtitle won&#8217;t help inform readers about what&#8217;s really in the book.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Glasz DeCuir</font> submitted <strong>Rebel Machinima Manifesto</strong> designed by ChabelaBooks. &#8220;Art Book &#8220;Rebel Machinima Manifesto&#8221; explores New Media Art with an aesthetic definition, content and proposals on Digital Filmmaking.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>An accomplished piece of artwork on a cover that&#8217;s fairly confusing to the casual browser.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Hassan Javed</font> submitted <strong>A Crammer&#8217;s Guide</strong> designed by Hassan Javed.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/A-Crammers-Guide.jpg" alt="A Crammer's Guide" title="A Crammer's Guide" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Not every nonfiction book needs a lot of &#8220;design&#8221; to sell, but at least you should be able to read the title, which is a struggle here.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Heather Day Gilbert</font> submitted <strong>Indie Publishing Handbook: Four Key Elements for the Self-Publisher</strong> designed by James at Go On Wirte. &#8220;This was my first time using a pre-made cover and I was very happy with it. James provided me with many background color samples on this one, and after showing them to a pool of readers, everyone agreed the blue background fit best. Loved the picture that showed our writer &#8220;tools of the trade.&#8221;&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>The illustration style adds a lot of charm to the cover, and the fonts are well chosen if a bit quiet.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">James Egan</font> submitted <strong>Determined</strong> designed by James T. Egan of Bookfly Design.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Determined.jpg" alt="Determined" title="Determined" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>An artful handling of a sober subject, beautifully put together.<font color="gold"><font size="+1"> &#9733; </font></font></p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jennifer Tzivia MacLeod</font> submitted <strong>Spineless Wonders: 10 Incredible Animals Without Bones</strong> designed by self. &#8220;Needed to suggest nonfiction and immediately let buyers know what the book was about while at the same time distinguishing it as the only book that mixes Jewish Biblical tradition with kids&#8217; science nonfiction.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Spineless-Wonders.jpg" alt="Spineless Wonders: 10 Incredible Animals Without Bones" title="Spineless Wonders: 10 Incredible Animals Without Bones" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Easy winner for title of the month, and I like the bright contrasting colors. However, the cover itself is very out of balance, communicating no idea of how all these elements are supposed to relate to one another.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Joe Sledge</font> submitted <strong>Did You See That? On The Outer Banks</strong> designed by Joe Sledge &amp; Barb Noel. &#8220;The original cover design is by Joe Sledge, the author, and it was put together by Barb Noel, the graphic artist.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Did-You-See-That.jpg" alt="Did You See That? On The Outer Banks" title="Did You See That? On The Outer Banks" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>There&#8217;s a certain amount of schizophrenia going here. The title typography, background, and overall composition are obviously the work of a professional, then you have those snapshots, which send a completely different message.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Julian Kirkman-Page</font> submitted <strong>The 7.52 to London bridge</strong> designed by Julian Kirkman-Page. &#8220;My book is a humourous autobiography. I am a commuter looking wistfully our of the carriage window and reminiscing on adventures and misadventures past. I designed the cover in Paint.net using a photograph of me and a watercolour from my book painted by me.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-752-to-London-bridge.jpg" alt="The 7.52 to London bridge" title="The 7.52 to London bridge" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A workable concept but a very ineffective execution. A designer could take all these ideas and elements and turn them into an actual book cover.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Kristen Harrison</font> submitted <strong>In These Great Times: Selected Writings</strong> designed by The Curved House (Emma King and Kristen Harrison). &#8220;Hello, we have designed an ebook series for a start-up indie publisher in Amsterdam. We are pleased to submit one of the covers for your consideration. The brief was to create a striking series style that reflects a German expressionist aesthetic and also appeals to contemporary readers. Thanks.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/In-These-Great-Times.jpg" alt="In These Great Times: Selected Writings" title="In These Great Times: Selected Writings" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A workable and interesting series design. Nice job.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Marcy Goldman</font> submitted <strong>The Baker&#8217;s Four Seasons</strong> designed by Damon of Damonza.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-Bakers-Four-Seasons.jpg" alt="The Baker's Four Seasons" title="The Baker's Four Seasons" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>With a mouth watering photo like that, how can you go wrong? Clearly the designer understands what readers want very well.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Noel Chidwick</font> submitted <strong>Let’s Build a Human Being</strong> designed by Noel Chidwick.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Lets-Build-a-Human-Being.jpg" alt="Let’s Build a Human Being" title="Let’s Build a Human Being" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I think a book like this about &#8220;functional physiology&#8221; would gain a lot by having more text on the cover to explain what it&#8217;s about. The visual approach is interesting although the typography doesn&#8217;t contribute much.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Sean Michael Hayes</font> submitted <strong>Five Weeks in the Amazon</strong> designed by Rory Doyle.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Five-Weeks-in-the-Amazon.jpg" alt="Five Weeks in the Amazon" title="Five Weeks in the Amazon" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A strong cover that cleverly makes the assertive type part of the illustration, drawing us into the image too. And that simmering pot is evocative, it just makes you want to know more.<font color="gold"><font size="+1"> &#9733; </font></font></p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Sue Irving</font> submitted <strong>How to conquer a mountain</strong> designed by Sue Irving.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/How-to-conquer-a-mountain.jpg" alt="How to conquer a mountain" title="How to conquer a mountain" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I wish I could find something positive to say about this cover, but I can&#8217;t. With all the commitment and energy it takes to complete a book, I would hope more care would go into packaging it.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Taillefer Long</font> submitted <strong>Spies I Knew</strong> designed by Taillefer Long. &#8220;I tried to recreate a WWII spy-thriller feel, using a codebreaking approach to the title that hopefully doesn&#8217;t take away from the legibility.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Spies-I-Knew.jpg" alt="Spies I Knew" title="Spies I Knew" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the device, but overall the tone of this cover is very dull, and the background is providing too much &#8220;static&#8221; to allow the type to really stand out.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Valerie Rind</font> submitted <strong>Gold Diggers and Deadbeat Dads: True Stories of Friends, Family, and Financial Ruin</strong> designed by Laura Duffy. &#8220;I discovered Laura Duffy after I perused hundreds of covers shown in these design contests. Her clean, clear style appealed to me. She pulled off a striking cover about a serious subject but with a touch of whimsy.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gold-Diggers-and-Deadbeat-Dads.jpg" alt="Gold Diggers and Deadbeat Dads: True Stories of Friends, Family, and Financial Ruin" title="Gold Diggers and Deadbeat Dads: True Stories of Friends, Family, and Financial Ruin" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Exactly what you want in a nonfiction cover, and notice that the title, subtitle, and visual treatment all combine to give us a very clear idea of what this book will be about.<font color="gold"><font size="+1"> &#9733; </font></font></p>
