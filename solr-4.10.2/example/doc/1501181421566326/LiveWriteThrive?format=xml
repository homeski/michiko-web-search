				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Commas seem to be the bane of many writers, and I’ve written numerous posts on their usage. I’ve even seen workshops devoted entirely to comma use. Yes, those tiny curly bits of punctuation can be intimidating!</p>
<p>You’ve probably heard that you need to use commas with speaker tags (“Go away,” Sally said). But you also need to use commas with direct address. There is a huge difference between the following sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let’s eat Grandma.</li>
<li>Let’s eat, Grandma.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that’s not too hard to get, right? Offset not just people’s names but anything (animal or object) in direct address:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen, you dumb computer—I’ve had it with you.</li>
<li>I will give you a biscuit, Fido, if you sit.</li>
<li>Hey, everyone, hurry up!</li>
<li>Please, sir, I’d like some more.</li>
</ul>
<p>And just a reminder of something <a title="A Capital Thought" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2012/04/27/a-capital-thought/">I’ve gone over before</a>: be sure to capitalize professions <em>in direct address</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is that test correct, Doctor?</li>
<li>Take me home, Captain.</li>
<li>Yes, Boss.</li>
<li>No, Mother, I don’t want soup.</li>
<li>Go take out the trash, Son.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope, dear writer, you now understand the need to insert those commas in the right places. I, for one, don’t want to eat Grandma.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>We&#8217;re continuing our look at Fatal Flaw # 1: Overwriting. Fiction writers often overwrite, and have trouble seeing how this manifests in their prose. Last week we looked at wordiness and redundancy. This week editor Linda Clare explores this topic further to help you determine which details in your scenes are important and which can be tossed.</em></p>
<p>The world is full of details—and good writers notice them perpetually. Yet when you introduce your created world to readers, it’s easy to get carried away. Let’s take a look at how overwriting, or including too many details, can derail your scenes and lose readers.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">You Are the Manager</h2>
<p>As a fiction writer, you are a manager. You hold the power to guide your readers, managing their attention and memory. By stressing a certain detail or event, you are managing readers by sending the message: “Pay attention to this. Remember this.”</p>
<p>If you attempt to write a scene that includes a blow-by-blow account of what is happening, it may mirror real life, but readers will not know which details matter to the story and which are incidental. If you overload readers with stimuli, they won’t know what to pay attention to and what to ignore. If you understand this, it’s easier to remind yourself to write only what the readers need to know, with a few “extra sprinkles” of concrete sensory detail (CSD) to help make the scene believable.<span id="more-6435"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Write the Right Details</h2>
<p>So which of these details do you choose to include in your scene? In order to create a believable world for readers, your scenes must be more realistic than the false building fronts of a Hollywood set. Details are vital to believability. If you only paint your scene in general or vague words, readers are less likely to remain engaged.</p>
<p>How do you know what to include and what to leave out? Think of your story as a road that runs through a city. There are lots of other roads, but only this one road leads readers to their destination: the story outcome. Along the way readers might smell the air or see the trees whizzing past, but they keep their eyes on the road.</p>
<p>The “extra” details you provide should add to the experience of the story in a sensory-emotional way. These details need to be connected to what your main character is after, whether it’s a new love, a killer, or a pot of gold. All other details are of little importance to the story and usually can be safely eliminated.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Leave Out the Boring Stuff</h2>
<p>Elmore Leonard famously said, “Leave out the boring parts that readers skip.” Many times these “boring” bits fall into the categories of stage directions, repetitions, or expositions. Stage directions that mimic real life can be insufferable for readers.</p>
<p>For instance, let’s say you write a scene about a meeting your character must attend. In real life these meetings are often long and boring and filled with missteps. There’s a computer glitch or someone is late. People drone on and on. You get the idea. The key to writing a scene with any extended boring or otherwise mundane situation is to give the reader the <em>feeling</em> of boring or repetitive without actually making readers suffer through the <em>actual boring thing</em>. For instance, if your scene is about a child whining in the grocery store, you can give the illusion of this without recording every line of dialog and action.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Rule of Three</h2>
<p>Something I call the Rule of Three can be helpful in deciding how much detail to include. In general, give readers three details of something important that you need readers to remember. These should be concrete and sensory—meaning they are connected in some way with the five senses and/or very specific (e.g., a cherry-red Camaro instead of a red car). You can also use the Rule of Three to give the illusion of a boring or unimportant action or dialog.</p>
<p>Going back to the whiny child in the store, you might write three lines or exchanges of dialog: “Mommy, can I have that Sugary Cereal?” “No, you can have plain Cheerios.” “But all the kids get Sugary Cereal!” “No, not all kids get it. Besides, you’re not all kids.” “Whhhhyyyy can’t I have it Mommy? Pleeeaaassse?” “I said no and that’s that.”</p>
<p>We understand that these types of exchanges typically go on and on. But to force your readers to endure the real-life version is cruel and will just drive them away. The example is plenty for readers to get the idea, the feeling, without having to suffer.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at an example of overwriting:</p>
<p><strong>BEFORE:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tiffany decided to encourage the design team to continue to keep up their good job. They had been working hard and accomplished a lot. That was part of her job—encouraging her team.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Now, team,” she told them at the meeting that had just started at three o’clock in the afternoon in the large corner office of their building, “we have just come up with a lot of exciting ideas for you to work on. I know you are already working hard and staying late, and I’m not looking to add to your workload. Therefore, I’ve asked Bill from merchandising to join us to share something we’ve been working on. We’ve developed a new strategy for our product offering that will be better for our business and make better use of the talent on this team. I know you are all very talented, and I want to encourage you. But we aren’t using everyone’s talents to the full or in the best way.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Bill came in and said hi to everyone. Then he plugged in his laptop and a PowerPoint presentation came up on the screen. He pressed buttons and skipped through some of the slides until he came to the ones he wanted to show everyone.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Here are some key facts that Tiffany and I wanted to share with you.” A chart showed that the number of styles from Women’s Apparel had increased on average 15 percent season to season. Another graph showed their best-selling products had the highest out-of-stocks. The last graph showed that margins had been on a straight line decline for the past few years. Tiffany thought Bill’s presentation was well done. He really focused on the things that her team needed to pay attention to, such as which styles had increased in sales and which were their best-selling items.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tiffany said, “This analysis shows we’re making a lot more stuff every year. But, we’re not making enough of the best stuff to satisfy demand. And despite all our hard work, we aren’t making money. The big conclusion? More stuff doesn’t mean better business. We need to make fewer, better things that sell. And that means a more manageable workload for you.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heads nodded all around.</p>
<p>Were you bored? Did you really need all those details? Now, let&#8217;s look at a more focused, tight, and clean version:</p>
<p><b>AFTER:</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tiffany encouraged her design team to keep up the good work. They’d been diligent and accomplished a lot.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Now, team,” she told them at the three o’clock meeting, “we’ve just come up with a lot of exciting ideas. You’re already working hard and staying late, and I’m not looking to add to your workload. I’ve asked Bill from merchandising to share a new strategy that will be better for everyone and utilize your talents more effectively.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Bill greeted the group and brought up his presentation on the screen. “Here are some key facts.” He pointed to a series of graphs. Women’s Apparel styles had increased an average fifteen percent increase, best-selling products had the highest out-of-stocks rate, and margins had been on a straight-line decline for the past few years. Tiffany nodded and smiled at Bill. His presentation really focused on the things that her team needed to pay attention to.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tiffany said, “We’re making a lot more stuff every year, but we’re not making enough of the best stuff to satisfy demand. And despite all our hard work, we aren’t making money. We need to make fewer, better things that sell. And that means a more manageable workload for you.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heads nodded all around.</p>
<p>The first thing you may notice is that the second version is far less wordy. Once we know what the scene is about, it’s not necessary to keep repeating words such as analysis, encouragement, or products. The people in the scene get it, and so do we.</p>
<p>And what about those boring missteps as Bill fumbles with his computer? These details might make for a comedy scene, but if they’re not central to the story, why torture readers unnecessarily? You might be able to use a bit of this if you put it into Tiffany’s (the POV) head: <em>That Bill! Why can’t he get his act together? </em>But in this example, the writer was only being faithful to nonessential details.</p>
<p>When you write scenes, do you worry that readers will not see the exact thing you imagine? If so, you may want to loosen your hold on the reins. As long as the story moves and is dramatizing what the story is about, you can safely allow readers to imagine these details any way they wish.</p>
<p>Your Turn:</p>
<p>What kinds of details do you think are the most important for readers to know? How do you tell if a detail is essential or just a boring addition?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>We&#8217;re continuing looking at healthy lifestyle for writers this month, so we can all start the New Year with vigor and focus. Today&#8217;s guest post is from author Harriet Hodgson:</em></p>
<p>Writing is hard work. Unfortunately, you may get so involved in a project that you keep at it longer than you should. Before you know it, hours have passed. Continuous keyboarding can lead to Repetitive Stress Injury (RSI), including tired eyes, headache, back pain, neck pain, sore hands, aching fingers, and even Deep Vein Thrombosis.</p>
<p>Staying healthy and in shape is a challenge for today’s writer—who is often parked behind a computer screen day after day. But these self-care tips will help keep writers healthy and productive.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Monitor snacks</strong>. When I was young and thin, I told myself that broken cookies didn’t contain any calories. I was delusional. Snack foods can be high-calorie and “empty calorie” foods with no nutritional value. It’s wise to keep healthy snacks on hand, things like baby carrots, grapes, and apples.<span id="more-6352"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Get a check-up. </strong>I have a heart murmur, so I try to get a check-up each year. I also pay attention to my Body Mass Index (BMI), a calculation based on height and weight. According to the Centers for Disease Control, we should strive for a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9. Your physician will be able to tell you more about the BMI for men and for women.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Schedule breaks. </strong>To prevent Repetitive Stress Injury, stretch your arms or stand up and move around for two minutes. “Desk Exercises—Office Exercises, Maintain Ergonomic Well-Being,” an article on the Ergo in Demand website, recommends thirty- to sixty-second micro-breaks every thirty minutes. Rest your eyes by looking away from the monitor and focusing on a distant object. Do this for thirty seconds every half hour.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Have a sleep routine. </strong>I get up at the same time every morning and try to go to bed at the same time each night. An hour before bedtime I start turning out lights. Following the recommendation of the Mayo Clinic, there is no television in the bedroom. Surprisingly, the Mayo Clinic also says you should put clocks out of sight. In its website article “Insomnia,” Mayo says clock-watching causes stress and makes it harder to get back to sleep.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Watch the caffeine. </strong>You may be one of those writers who “runs” on coffee and refills your cup constantly. But too much coffee can cause a spike in blood pressure. Consider drinking half-caf as I do or decaffeinated coffee. Some nutrition experts recommend no caffeinated beverages after noon.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Use your body clock. </strong>I’m an early-morning person, and it’s not unusual for me to get up at four thirty a.m. and crank out copy. You may be an early-morning person, afternoon person, or late-night person. Whichever you are, take advantage of this time, and schedule important work then. Save less important tasks for when your body clock is slower.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Be self-compassionate. </strong>Writing has its ups and downs. The downs—another reject letter, extensive revisions, a tight deadline—can be discouraging. Instead of beating yourself up, be kind to yourself. Take a day off. Go to a movie. Have lunch with a friend. E-mail someone who writes in the same genre and share some encouraging thoughts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Focus on positives. </strong>This idea is from composer and singer Paul Alexander. In a December 6, 2014 Facebook post, Alexander suggests keeping notes about good things. His idea was to aid grief recovery, but it may be applied to writing. When something good happens to you, note it on a small piece of paper, then put the paper in a jar. At the end of the year, empty the jar and “see what awesome stuff happened,” Alexander advises. I just started my good things jar and love it. The first notes: <em>Blurb about my Jan. workshop in senior center</em> <em>newsletter. Article in national magazine.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Read. </strong>The writers I know love to read. Reading expands vocabulary, leads to new ideas, and makes us aware of the world. My family didn’t get a TV until I was a senior in high school. Instead of watching the boob tube, my brother and I took out dozens of books from the library. I think my love of reading comes from this time. Reading can relax you and give you a break from writing.</p>
<p>These are just a few self-care tips. You may have other tips that work for you. Self-care keeps your creative juices flowing. Put self-care on your writing schedule today!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What’s so dangerous about . . . whatever those things are? What is a participle? It’s a verb or a noun that gets turned into an adjective. Participles can be in the present tense or the past tense, and the present participle always ends with &#8220;ing.&#8221; For example, &#8220;sing&#8221; is a verb, and &#8220;singing&#8221; is its present participle.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of sentence openings with participles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Floating downstream . . .</li>
<li>Beating me at cards . . .</li>
<li>Turning the doorknob . . .</li>
</ul>
<p>There is nothing wrong with beginning sentences with these phrases, but watch what happens when close attention isn’t being paid to the subject of the phrase:</p>
<ul>
<li>Floating downstream, the day seemed so peaceful.</li>
<li>Beating me at cards, my fun evening with my friends cost me my week’s wages.</li>
<li>Turning the doorknob, the noises in the creepy room scared me.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’d have a strange story with days that float down streams, evenings that can play cards, and noises that can turn doorknobs. These erroneous constructions are called “dangling participles”—because a phrase ends up hanging all by its lonesome without a proper subject to support it.</p>
<p>Solution: Do a search through your document for <em>ing</em> and examine all sentences that begin with a participial phrase. If any are dangling, grab the correct noun and put it in place to support the phrase.</p>

<p>When you put pen to paper, it’s fully possible to underwrite. To fail to say what you meant to say. But just as possible, and more common, is <em>overwriting</em>—the tendency to say too much, in too many words, and crowd out the forest for the trees.</p>
<p>Overwriting takes many forms.  Wordiness. Overuse of modifiers and weak sentence construction. Vagueness. Redundancy. Convolution. Pushing metaphors so far beyond the breaking point that they cease to be enlightening and become ridiculous instead. Purple prose.<span id="more-6318"></span></p>
<p>(Wikipedia: “In literary criticism, <em>purple prose</em> is written prose that is so extravagant, ornate, or flowery as to break the flow and draw excessive attention to itself.”)</p>
<p>In all forms, overwriting loses the forest for the trees: readers get so snarled up in excessive words, tangled sentences, and overdone diction that the big picture is lost.</p>
<p>It’s not fun to read. And often, it’s not fun to write. If your words feel forced or unnatural while you’re writing them, you might be falling into this trap. It often happens when we try to “sound like real writers,” or we want to come across as particularly smart or poetic. In those cases we lose our own voices for something artificial.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Finding the Forest</h2>
<p>You correct overwriting by letting go of your commitment to every individual tree, leaf, and branch and rediscovering the forest instead. Where’s the heart of the scene? The point of the dialog? The voice of the character?</p>
<p>There’s a story that tells how Michelangelo carved his famous <em>David </em>by chipping away everything that didn’t look like David. That’s how you cure overwriting.</p>
<p><strong>BEFORE:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As the sun was sinking down far below the edge of the purple, colorful horizon at the edge of the world, Jenny raised her wineglass to her ruby red lips and sighed sadly to see the day end. “It’s over,” she breathed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behind her, her impossibly handsome Italian boyfriend, Calvino, pushed his chair away from the table where they had been eating dinner like a panther slinking through the shadows of a dark night in Africa. She was just thinking he had been sitting there too long and wondering when he would come to join her by the edge of the expansive gold-rimmed balcony with its fluted decorations patterned after a famous architect from 1743.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He started to come toward her, and she waited for a long, interminable minute, staring at the purple sunset clouds, until he walked across the balcony, approached her shoulder, and bent down slightly so he could whisper in her ear. “It’s never really over,” he murmured.</p>
<p><strong>AFTER:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As the sun sank below the purple horizon, Jenny raised her wineglass to her red lips and sighed to see the day end. “It’s over.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Behind her, Calvino pushed his chair away from the dinner table. <em>It’s about time, </em>she thought. She saw his dark Italian features from the corner of her eye as he approached her on the gold-rimmed balcony.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“It’s never really over,” he whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>In this example, the edited version is far shorter—and far more focused.</p>
<p>It cuts redundant language, so “As the sun was sinking down far below the edge of the purple, colorful horizon at the edge of the world” becomes “As the sun sank below the purple horizon.”</p>
<p>It cuts a lot of the small in-between actions that can so clutter prose: “She was thinking and wondering”; “he started to come toward her”; “he walked, approached, and bent down.”</p>
<p>The rewritten version also implies the relationship between the two characters through their actions and words, rather than explaining it outright. It cuts details that are irrelevant to the scene (the eighteenth-century architect) and a simile that, in the end, added nothing to the character or the moment.</p>
<p>By cutting all these examples of wordiness, we end up with a sharper scene—one that is focused on the forest. The tension between the characters. The lament over the end of the day. The promise of something more to come. Many a tree is gone, but the picture is clearer.</p>
<p>Extrapolate that first example over the course of an entire scene, or an entire chapter, and you can see why overwriting can be such a problem—and why learning to cut back, <em>to focus on the scene you actually want your readers to see,</em> can go such a long way toward creating a sharper, more vivid and memorable story.</p>
<p>Your turn:</p>
<p>What do you think? Would you have kept any details or wording in the BEFORE section? Why? Have you ever found yourself forcing words in order to sound smarter or more “writerly”? What were the results? Do any of the examples of overwriting given above regularly show up in your own work?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, it probably sounds as if I&#8217;ve taken a left turn at Albuquerque (as Bugs Bunny was wont to say) by bringing up this subject of weight loss. But we&#8217;ve just survived the holidays, and that usually means our clothes are no longer fitting.</p>
<p>For real? Why talk about weight loss on a writing blog? Think about it before you start to whine. Part of a writer&#8217;s strategic plan is to first and foremost stay alive to be able to write all those great books she yearns to write someday. And not just stay alive but have a healthy life, to the best of her ability (granted, some of us have to deal with difficult health challenges, disabilities, or other circumstances that limit us).</p>
<p>This month is going to be &#8220;writer health month&#8221; on my blog. No, don&#8217;t run out of the room to raid the fridge out of apprehension and fear. Hang in there.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Just What Kind of Good Health?</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s take this a step further. What kind of &#8220;good health&#8221; do we need? Aside from the basic good health that will (we hope) keep us from succumbing to debilitating diseases or injuries that will prevent us from being able to write, we want health that will help us use our facilities in the best way (no, I&#8217;m not talking about the local Starbuck&#8217;s, although that too, in a  perambulatory sense). We want a sharp mind, keen memory, and agile fingers able to type on the keyboard (again, if possible).<span id="more-5927"></span></p>
<p>In other words, although we may be limited in varying ways regarding just how great our health can be, there are always things we can do to improve our health so that we can attain our writing goals. We ignore health at our peril, for we need strong focused minds, energy and stamina, and overall body health to be able to write books.</p>
<p>Everyone has a different method for staying healthy, and I&#8217;m not going to go into health regimes in this post, for, as you have noticed (and maybe cringed at), the title is about weight loss.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Sad Truth</h2>
<p>If you are one of those rare lucky individuals with a fast metabolism and don&#8217;t worry about gaining weight, you can just leave the room right now. Those of us who wake up determined that day to curtail our eating and stick to a diet (which we might do perhaps every day of our life) don&#8217;t want to hear how you can eat all you want, anything, and not gain a pound. Okay, life isn&#8217;t fair, we grumble. But we have to deal with it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like being overweight. I hate sitting at my computer and feeling fat. There is nothing more discouraging to me than pulling on a pair of my favorite jeans and they are too tight to zip up. Argh! But what I hate even more is dieting. What a torment!</p>
<p>Sadly, a writer&#8217;s lot is to spend endless hours sitting in front of a computer. Sure, there are some crazy writers out there who actually jog on a treadmill with a laptop situated such that they can run while they write. Really! I can&#8217;t imagine how; my brain would just rattle and my eyes would go wonkers.</p>
<p>But suffice it to say, many writers slowly (or quickly) accumulate unwanted pounds as they write year after year. And we all know that as we get older (for most of us—not those lucky sods who left the room), our metabolism slows to a crawl. Like a shallow creek in the heat of summer. And as we get older, we are more susceptible to illness and injury.</p>
<p>So being deliberate in our desire to lose or maintain a healthy weight is really an important strategic goal for a writer. And I don’t mean to lecture anyone about how to go about this, for there are plenty of weight-loss plans out there. I’m just going to share what works for me as a writer with a writing schedule and a very busy life. I hope you&#8217;ll share your methods in the comments!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">I Hate Wasting Time</h2>
<p>Maybe you have time to drive twenty minutes both ways to a gym and work out. I don’t. I don’t want to waste a minute, so just like streamlining social networking and marketing and promotion, I try to figure out the best use of my time to get the most bang out of it.</p>
<p>One pitfall of being a writer who works at home is access to food. If you live alone and don’t have willpower, you can just keep the larder and refrigerator empty of those yummy but pound-producing snacks. However, most of us live with other people who want those yummies around, and so it’s a challenge to resist them.</p>
<p>One solution to this is to go somewhere else to write. I have spent endless days at libraries working—yes, to get away from my dog, who wants me to throw the ball endlessly, and I&#8217;m a softie and have a hard time saying no. Really, though, one reason I go work at libraries is to be removed from the temptation to snack. And it&#8217;s usually a quiet place that helps with my concentration. I can&#8217;t work with noise around me. Also being at another location prevents me from getting up to wash dishes or clean house.</p>
<p>One best-selling author I know says she will do just about anything to keep from writing (although she loves to write). But I get that. It&#8217;s so easy to get distracted, feeling guilty over that load of laundry piled on top of the dryer, staring at us as we sit trying to write.</p>
<p>So although I hate to waste time, it&#8217;s worth it to me to spend the time to drive to a place that will afford me quiet time to concentrate without the distraction of food.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">My Simple Plan</h2>
<p>Here are some things I do to help me lose weight (which I often need to do because I really suck at willpower when it comes to food). I don’t know if this will help you, but I thought I’d share my methods, and then maybe you can share some of yours in the comments.</p>
<ul>
<li>When I wake up in the morning, I run two miles on my treadmill (slowly) before I get busy working. You may not have a treadmill. And perhaps like me, you hate to exercise outside unless the weather is pleasant. You may dislike going to health clubs, or not. Whatever your taste and location, just find some way to get in a half hour of exercise. I listen to audiobooks or uplifting music. I plan out my day as I run, and clear things off my mental plate.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My daughters subscribe to a yoga program online. They can choose the kinds of poses they want based on target areas (like positions to strengthen the back) and choose the length of the class. They then lay out a mat on the floor and follow the exercises shown on their laptop screen. If you have Internet at home, this is doable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you are more self-motivated, you can just create a lists of exercises to do, like jumping jacks and pushups and stretches. They key though is to get your heart rate up for a while and actually produce some sweat and heavy breathing. Go ahead, complain. You&#8217;ll feel so much better though if you start the day doing this. Don&#8217;t have time? No excuse. Just set your alarm an hour earlier.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drink a liter of water—all of it—before you eat anything. Preferably after you do that half-hour run. Try to drink another one before each meal. That helps cut down your appetite.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t eat anything until noon. Suck it up. It won&#8217;t kill you.</li>
<li>Eat only two meals: lunch and dinner. No snacking. Keep your daily calories down to about 500. That means something like this for each meal: an apple or orange, a serving of lean meat or other protein (like nonfat cottage cheese), and a salad (fat-free dressing or lemon juice) or some steamed or raw vegetables (that aren&#8217;t starchy like potatoes). No starches (rice, bread, etc.). No sugar (Argh again!). No fats (butter, oils).</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, this is a kind of torturous boot camp, but I&#8217;ve been able to lose five pounds a week on this program. If I really need chocolate, I will allow myself one small square as a reward at night. If I don&#8217;t reward myself in some way, I&#8217;d go crazy. If I&#8217;ve been really good, I&#8217;ll have a diet fudge ice cream bar or a skinny mocha frappuchino at Starbuck&#8217;s.</p>
<p>And remember, you don&#8217;t have to do this forever. This is just temporary misery until you get down to your desired weight. Once there, you can allow yourself to splurge from time to time to stay sane. Can&#8217;t write if you go crazy, right? Many of you will agree with me, though, that there is nothing that feels better than being thin and trim.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;d like to hear your thoughts? What do you do to stay healthy, without wasting too much time? What&#8217;s worked for you when it comes to stirring that willpower and losing weight?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s start the new year by taking a look at misplaced modifiers. A modifier is . . . well, what it sounds like. It’s a word or phrase that modifies (affects, changes) another word.</p>
<p>In the phrase “blue ball,” the adjective <em>blue</em> modifies the noun <em>ball.</em> Writers sometimes stick those modifiers in the wrong place in a sentence. Take a look at these lines and see if you can identify the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>This morning I chased a dog in my pajamas. (Did the dog dress himself?)</li>
<li>I sold a desk to a lady that had broken legs. (Poor woman; how will she carry that desk?)</li>
<li>We sat on the porch listening to the birds sing while playing cards. (Wow, talented birds.)</li>
<li>She saw several whales on vacation in Mexico. (Do whales take vacations?)</li>
<li>The hunter waited for the lion with a rifle in his hand. (Or should I say, “in his paw”?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Modifiers can sneak into the wrong places if we’re not careful.</p>
<p>Solution: Check your long, complex sentences and make them shorter. Break them into two shorter sentences that have clear adjectives connected to (modifying) the noun. Or move the modifying phrase to the proper location in the sentence.</p>
<p>For example: The hunter waited with a rifle in his hand for the lion. Easy.</p>
<p>Now that I found those modifiers, maybe you can tell me where I misplaced my glasses.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is our last post wrapping up the year’s course on The 12 Key Pillars of Novel Construction. I hope you now have a toolbox full of great building tools, as well as a handle on how to use them to build strong pillars for your novel. The twelve pillars we’ve looked at are foundational to your story; they hold it up. If any of these pillars are weak, your novel will fail. It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>I spoke <a title="Building Your Novel with a Holistic Approach" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/12/24/building-your-novel-with-a-holistic-approach/">last week a</a>bout approaching the writing of a novel in a holistic manner rather than piecemeal. In other words, there is a big problem in tackling a huge undertaking such as a novel by looking at the pieces as separate components that can be developed apart from all the others.<span id="more-6249"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">A Novel Is Not a Sum Total of Its Parts</h2>
<p>Many writing craft books teach this piecemeal approach. They discuss how to write a good plot, or how to come up with tight dialog, or how to create interesting characters. Yes, all these components are part of a novel. But just because there are twenty-six letters in the English language, that doesn’t mean you can combine them any which way and you’ll end up with the great American novel. Novels, like houses or skyscrapers or jet planes, must have all their parts working together smoothly and for one ultimate purpose—to perform in the manner intended.</p>
<p>When you begin to kick around ideas for a novel, it’s like rummaging through a barrel of mechanical parts. You might pull out a few dozen nuts, bolts, wires, spark plugs, and metal plates. You might know the many uses for each part, and if you took the time, you could craft some cool-looking sculptures. Maybe even something functional. In junior high, I learned how to wire a Masonite board so that if I touched two wires together, a lightbulb lit up (I thought I was pretty clever).</p>
<p>But we writers don’t want to just throw a bunch of parts together and hope we end up with a neat-looking novel. We want a novel that holds together on every level. This is the biggest problem, hands down, that I see in the hundreds of novels I critique every year. Most of them are like these creative building projects. There seems to be some idea or theme or purpose to them, something hinted at, but when I stand back (or stare up close), I can’t see the forest for the trees. There are a lot of trees, some very pretty, but no forest. No true, clear, compelling, powerful story.</p>
<p>What I’m saying is a novel is not a sum total of all its parts. Not by a long stretch. This is why I’ve emphasized spending time <a title="Ways Novelists Can Brainstorm Plot and Scenes" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2013/10/07/ways-novelists-can-brainstorm-plot-and-scenes/">brainstorming </a>and <a title="Creative Mind Mapping for Novelists" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2013/09/30/creative-mind-mapping-for-novelists/">mind mapping</a> your plot, characters, setting, themes—all your elements. And why I urged you to work on all four of the key <a title="Revisiting the Four Primary Pillars of Novel Construction" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/06/04/revisiting-the-four-primary-pillars-of-novel-construction/">corner support pillars </a>of your novel together until all four are tightly knit.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Perils of Working Piecemeal</h2>
<p>Here’s why. I see a lot of novels that have a great premise or plot idea. They might even have a terrific <a title="Coming Up with a Kicker of a Concept" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/01/29/coming-up-with-a-kicker-of-a-concept/">concept with a kicker</a>. But . . . there isn’t a clear protagonist. I have no clue <em>who</em> the story is about (for a novel must be about someone!). Or I may see there’s a protagonist, but most of the time, she has no goal, ever, in the book. I keep waiting, waiting, waiting . . . and by the end of the book, I shake my head. What did that character want? Why were they even in the story? Oh, so the plot could be shown. Ugh.</p>
<p>And then, there are novels with a great concept and a <a title="A Compelling Novel Centers On the Protagonist’s Goal" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/02/12/a-compelling-novel-centers-on-the-protagonists-goal/">protagonist with a terrific goal</a>, but there is zilch tension and the pacing drags and the book is torturous to read to the end. Why? Because there are <a title="Creating Conflict with a Purpose" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/03/19/creating-conflict-with-a-purpose/">no stakes. No central conflict.</a> You can have a character with a “lofty” goal of wanting to climb Mt. Everest. Maybe he’s a really intriguing character—funny, original, empathetic. But the book contains little to no conflict. Of course, climbing Everest has inherent <a title="The Secret to Crafting High Stakes" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/03/26/the-secret-to-crafting-high-stakes/">high stakes</a>—our hero could lose his life, and that risk brings tension with it. And maybe there’s a snowstorm or an accident, but overall there is no <em>central</em> conflict. And without that, the book reads like a string of events, ups and downs, with no real purpose to it. Which brings me to . . .</p>
<p><a title="Theme—What’s at the Heart of Your Story" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/04/30/theme-whats-at-the-heart-of-your-story/">Theme</a>. For theme is the glue that binds all those three elements: the concept with a kicker, the protagonist with a goal, and the conflict with high stakes. Theme is the heart of your story, and it speaks of the heart of your protagonist, who must embody the theme. If your protagonist’s goal for that novel is <em>only</em> to get to the top of Everest, that isn’t going to ensure the book will be riveting. It might be a great novel if it has amazing writing and interesting characters who engage in clever dialog, with some conflict. But even with all that, if there isn’t a <em>point</em> to the story, it will fall a bit flat. It may get some nice reviews and garner some readers who really enjoyed the book. But it could be so much better, so much more, if themes were developed that wove through the novel and were intrinsic to the character’s core need.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Fasten All Those Components Together</h2>
<p>This is what I mean by holistic. Working all the pillars together, as if using fasteners between posts in a building to add additional sturdiness.</p>
<p>When we built our bed and breakfast on a cliff over the ocean back in 1989 in California, we made it through plan check just fine—until the county building department decided we needed to add additional support for earthquake safety. That meant an added cost of nearly twenty thousand dollars in metal struts and fasteners to bolt to the posts and studs throughout. After finishing construction, our building contractor shook his head and said, “Well, now you can bulldoze this house off the cliff, and when it hits the beach two hundred feet below, it&#8217;ll stay in one piece.”</p>
<p>Were we glad we had to cough up that much money for a bunch of metal strips and bolts? No—but we changed our tune when over the next ten years we got hit with some big earthquakes—including two that destroyed sections of nearby towns and freeways (the inn was situated on the biggest earthquake fault in California). Our inn remained unscathed. I think we sustained a few hairline cracks in a ceiling or two. But that’s all.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if after you finish writing your novel and publish it, you only got an occasional “hairline” crack [read; negative review]? If you make sure all your pillars of novel support are strong, you can be sure your novel will hold up.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Now What?</h2>
<p>If you’ve been careful in your construction, what then? Is there any other way to be sure you haven’t missed something?</p>
<p>Sure—get a professional critique. Choose an editor who really has a handle on novel construction, preferably someone who has written and successfully published some novels (although that’s not necessarily essential).</p>
<p>Keep in mind that line editing (correcting grammar and punctuation) is not the same thing. Just having a content edit, or even a developmental edit that digs deep into your writing, is not the same as having your “big picture” elements examined. I believe <em>every</em> novel can benefit from a professional critique—even those of best-selling authors.</p>
<p>A number of successful authors have me edit and critique all their novels. I can honestly say I have yet to come across the perfect novel that has not needed some work, that did not have some problematic areas that needed revisiting, or that had some plot issues that needed resolving. I keep waiting for the day that perfect manuscript will cross my desk—one that I won’t have to mark up at all. That I can gaze at, open-mouthed in astonishment in the realization that it is perfect, flawless, and ready to publish. I haven’t seen it yet. I know mine sure aren’t perfect, and that’s why I have my trusted author friends critique my books after I write the first draft (friends who will be tough!).</p>
<p>So think about having your work critiqued . . . before you have it line edited. Don’t put pretty icing on a yucky cake. If you really want to be a great novelist and write those books that will stand up under scrutiny and the test of time, be willing to invest time and money into creating a beautiful product.</p>
<p>There is nothing more satisfying than holding your novel in your hand and being proud of this magnificent story you’ve built. I wish that wonderful, joyous experience for all of you, and hope the new year will be one chockful of writing . . . and writing well!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Our New Course!</h2>
<p>I’m excited! Next Wednesday we start a wholly unique course that will be sure to help you with your writing. Instead of writing a whole course for the year all by my lonesome, I’ve enlisted four top editor/authors who are going to be tackling the fatal flaws of fiction writing. Every single post is going to have before and after passages, so that you can easily see not just what the major mistakes of fiction writing are, you will also see ways to fix them. There is nothing more helpful than getting concrete examples of what works and doesn’t work and how to fix the problems.</p>
<p>So join me for a great new year. Be sure to subscribe to the blog so you won’t miss any posts, and share some of your thoughts in the comments on how you benefited from The 12 Key Pillars of Novel Construction. I&#8217;ve appreciated all the support and comments over the year! Now, on to 2015!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today&#8217;s guest post is by Jen Scott, associate editor at </em>Firewords Quarterly<em>:</em></p>
<p>One of the most rewarding parts of my job is that it affords me the opportunity to discover tremendous writers. On a personal level, showcasing their imagination and skill provides endless satisfaction. Some have been writing for years while, for others, I am the first editor to accept their work. Age is of no consequence: often a person&#8217;s first publishing success comes later in life, yet I have also eagerly published those who are still at high school. Moreover, some writers provide a long list of previous credits in esteemed magazines but are ultimately rejected, while others include a short, unassuming line of introduction and totally blow me away.</p>
<p>While there is no hard-and-fast formula for making a successful submission, time and time again I see writers with great potential falling into the same traps which lead to rejection. Here is some advice on how to avoid these common pitfalls.</p>
<p><span id="more-6338"></span></p>
<p>Here are some tips for writing a winning short story:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be original</strong>. Magazines receive a lot of clichés and stock plots/characters. Don’t base your characters on those from a great novel or the last movie you’ve watched.</li>
<li><strong>Be subtle</strong>. The phrase  &#8220;Show, Don’t Tell&#8221; is overused yet relevant. Your readers are intelligent people; they can work things out. This is an obvious part of the writer’s craft, but it is surprising how many times people slip up in their eagerness to convey their meaning.</li>
<li><strong>Grab the reader instantly and make sure they&#8217;re engaged.</strong> There is no time for scene-setting of the verbose nature often seen in novel writing. Even if your story is ultimately superb, a slow start could make the difference when you are on the editor’s table as they make the decision to &#8220;cut.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Go out on a high.</strong> There&#8217;s nothing more frustrating than getting excited about a story, only to be let down by a weak ending. Really think about what the reader is left with at the end. And remember, this does not always mean squeezing in a twist or surprise. While these can doubtlessly be effective, equally as effective are those endings that leave us with food for thought or are rounded off in a satisfying (and perhaps sometimes predictable) way.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t be scared of a happy ending</strong>. It is all too easy to think that being memorable equates to being dramatic and depressing. Often a funny or feel-good finish is just as powerful.</li>
<li><strong>Edit ruthlessly</strong>. Every word counts in a short story. As with our third tip, this is where short stories really do differ from the world of novel writing, in which the careful construction of atmosphere is key.</li>
<li><strong>Proofread your work before submitting.</strong> Better yet, ask another writer or an editor to do this. Silly errors seriously call into question your ability as a writer and automatically put the editorial team off your work. They don’t have time to look past silly errors at the wonderful ideas contained within.</li>
<li><strong>All finished?</strong> Reread your work to ensure that your writing makes sense! At least one in ten submissions that I read are not completely coherent but contain worthwhile material. The reason for this is most likely the hours of work that writers put into their stories, honing them to perfection. With such close attention, it is easy to lose perspective. Once completed, leave your story, step back, and view it through your reader’s eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips for the submission process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Research the journal</strong> you are submitting to and follow the guidelines. These can often seem long-winded, but are designed to save both you and the editor time. If, for example, they have a word limit on the length of the short stories they accept, they will not consider any longer pieces, and you are wasting your time. Some magazines take an eclectic approach; others favor a certain style. Unsure? A quick read of the magazine in question will surely set aside any fears and, again, saves wasting your time.</li>
<li><strong>Send simultaneous submissions</strong> if it is allowed by each publication you are interested in. If a magazine receives a high volume of submissions, then it can take a few months to hear back from them. In this case, you don’t want to miss out on another opportunity as you await a response.</li>
<li><strong>A word of warning</strong> though: don’t spread your submissions too far and wide. Choose carefully and in stages. If you submit a story to fifty publications, you have to go with the first to pick it up. Cherry-pick your favorites first, then move on to magazines you are less interested in.</li>
<li><strong>Inform the other publications immediately if you are picked up.</strong> It is always an extremely difficult decision to cut out great pieces of writing in favor of those we feel are slightly stronger. Don’t let someone else be rejected and miss out on publication.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally: when you are rejected, don’t get downhearted or stop trying. There are many reasons for an editor rejecting a piece. Whatever you do, don’t reply or argue, especially to personal feedback. Any specific advice given by an editor will have taken time and effort, and will have been written purely with the intention of helping you. So gather all the tips you can, then relax and enjoy the creative process. Who knows what successes your next endeavor will bring.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">I think we can all agree that subjects and verbs need to agree with one another. A singular subject takes a singular verb.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nancy is the school librarian.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plural subjects take plural verbs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nancy and Ned are friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>But we don’t always write with such simple subjects. What is the correct verb form in these sentences?</p>
<ul>
<li>A pack of wolves was/were howling in the distance.</li>
<li>A bundle of ballots was/were found in the official’s car.</li>
<li>A flock of geese is/are migrating overhead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each subject includes both a singular and a plural noun: pack—singular/wolves—plural; bundle—singular/ballots—plural; flock—singular/geese—plural. So do you use a singular or plural verb?</p>
<p>I could get into a lot of technical terms here like <em>notional vs. formal agreement</em> and <em>predeterminer</em>. But I prefer <em>Merriam-Webster’s</em> “plain sense” solution: “When you have a collecting noun phrase (<em>a bunch of</em>) before a plural noun (<em>the boys</em>), the sense will normally be plural and so should the verb.”<span id="more-4912"></span></p>
<p>But there is another way of understanding this. A noun/subject phrase like “a bundle of ballots” includes a head noun—bundle. The noun establishes whether the verb is singular or plural. In most cases, that will be correct.</p>
<p>Applying this principle to the above examples, we would choose the following verbs:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pack of wolves was howling . . . (The intent or emphasis here is on the pack—singular.)</li>
<li>A bundle of ballots was found . . . (Again the sense of the subject is that <em>many</em> ballots were located someplace they should not have been.)</li>
<li>A flock of geese is migrating . . . (Though it would not be improper to say a flock of geese <em>are</em> migrating, if your sense is that the emphasis should be on the geese rather than the flock.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t you love it when you get to determine what’s right and wrong?</p>
