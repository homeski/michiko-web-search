				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here’s the not-so-secret secret about your book editor: he loves books.</p>
<p>Sure, sometimes a book editor loves being right, but on the whole he loves reading, working with words, and seeing writers grow into authors. <a title="Book Editors: How to Become a Book Editor" href="http://mediacareers.about.com/od/mediajobprofiles/a/BookEditor.htm" target="_blank">A book editor does what he does</a> because he wants to help authors put their best words forward.</p>
<p>But if you’ve never worked with a book editor, how do you know <a title="The 4 Most Common Mistakes Fiction Editors See" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2011/02/4-most-common-mistakes-fiction-editors.html" target="_blank">what you should offer beyond just sending him your best draft</a>?</p>
<p>Here are five simple yet effective ways you can endear yourself to a book editor.</p>
<h2>1. Be Timely</h2>
<p>A book editor often <a title="Your Questions Answered: Multiple Projects" href="http://penforasword.cmail2.com/t/ViewEmail/j/E0984014843A7846/BE9EE6D1EEB1C8C4C9C291422E3DE149#toc_item_2" target="_blank">works on multiple projects at once</a>, whether that’s editing books, writing his own, or freelancing in other ways. Consequently, he may have more deadlines than you as an author might have. And while it would be nice to believe your book is always his top priority, that’s not always the case.</p>
<p>Busy editors (who tend to be the <em>good</em> editors) juggle projects, shifting their prioritized work day-by-day. Some days, your book will be a top priority. Other days, it won’t. Regardless, a book editor can’t do his job unless the author holds up his end of the contract as well. Always respond to an editor’s comments or questions within a reasonable timeframe, like one or two business days.</p>
<h2>2. Be Available</h2>
<p>Timeliness means being available. If you’re a busy professional<a title="11 Ways Stay-at-Home Moms (and Other Busy Folks) Can Find Time to Write" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/04/11-ways-stay-at-home-moms-and-other.html" target="_blank"> trying to eke out a book in the margins of your life</a>, this can be a daunting task, but understand that your editor can’t finish your book until he&#8217;s received feedback from you. Of course, editors know you also have a schedule and other responsibilities. They’ll work with you to find a suitable time and avenue to communicate. Many freelance editors will even go so far as to talk with you after traditional business hours, especially if you have a full-time job.</p>
<p>Like any good working relationship, it’s a give-and-take that requires flexibility from both parties. You’ll endear yourself to your editor if you regularly make yourself available and seldom miss an appointment.</p>
<h2>3. Be Honest</h2>
<p>A book editor will be brutally honest about your work. He may make so many changes you might wonder whether it’s even the same book. But <a title="Why YOUR Opinion of Your Writing Is the One That Matters Most" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2009/05/importance-of-pleasing-ourselves-in-our.html" target="_blank">always remember that it’s<em> your </em>book</a>. Unless it’s regarding <a title="Most Common Writing Mistakes: 10 Stylistic Mistakes Sabotaging Your Story" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2011/08/most-common-mistakes-series-10.html" target="_blank">black-and-white grammatical issues</a>, editors aren’t telling you what to do. Rather, they’re making <a title="A Quick Guide to Beta Reader Etiquette" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/12/beta-reader-etiquette.html" target="_blank">knowledgeable and well-intentioned suggestions they believe will make your book better</a>.</p>
<p>Trust is built on honesty, so don’t hold back on your <em>own</em> feedback. <a title="How to Disagree With Your Editor" href="http://talariapress.com/2012/11/09/ask-the-editor-2-how-to-disagree-with-your-editor/" target="_blank">When a suggested change doesn’t jibe with your voice or plot, speak up</a>. Editors like to see authors defend their work with reasonable arguments. This often leads to a better book, and both the author and editor learn more about each other.</p>
<p>Always remember: <em>you are the sole champion for your book’s vision</em>. Your editor will expect <a title="Putting Your Writer’s Ego in Your Back Pocket" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2008/06/putting-your-ego-in-your-back-pocket.html" target="_blank">you to be able to take criticism</a>; you should expect the same of them.</p>
<h2>4. Be Patient</h2>
<p>Proper editing takes time. If you send your 80,000-word book (320 pages) to a copyeditor capable of working on ten pages per hour, it will take that editor thirty-two hours to complete your edit.</p>
<p>“That’s less than a typical week’s worth of work,” you may think. That’s both true and not true. Remember, editors typically work on multiple projects. If they allot two hours per day to the project mentioned above, it will take them sixteen business days to finish editing your book. That’s half a month, and that doesn’t include lulls in work while seeking feedback from clients.</p>
<p><a title="Penny Sansevieri’s Tips for Selling Books by the Truckload" href="http://socialmediajustforwriters.com/penny-sansevieris-tips-selling-books-truckload/" target="_blank">With more than 3,500 new books appearing on Amazon <em>every day</em></a>, you can’t afford to rush your book to market. It will get its lunch eaten and be forgotten by dinner. As hard as it is, be patient with the process.</p>
<h2>5. Be Open</h2>
<p>E.L. Doctorow said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Writing is an exploration. You start from nothing and learn as you go.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>In writing as in life, there’s always more to learn.</em></p>
<p>The jots and tittles of writing may always remain constant, but the infinite variations a writer can concoct from letters, words, and ideas <a title="Why No Writer Knows What He’s Doing" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2010/06/why-no-writer-knows-what-hes-doing.html" target="_blank">require an ongoing openness to the craft</a>. But this lofty and inspiring idea crashes back to reality when you receive your bleeding manuscript back from an editor. In that singular moment, you may want to hold your barely breathing manuscript close to your chest, whisper, “My precious,” then never contact your editor again.</p>
<p>That’s okay. But it’s <em>not</em> okay to stay that way. Being open to even the most heinous of edits is a hallmark of writers who are intent on becoming better writers.</p>
<p>If you’re timely, available, honest, patient, and open—and if you’ve written the best manuscript you can—you will endear yourself to your book editor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most authors try to understand what a character is feeling at a particular moment: <em>He&#8217;s angry here. He&#8217;s happy there.</em> Many authors also <a title="Creating Stunning Character Arcs, Pt. 1: Can You Structure Characters?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/02/character-arcs-1.html" target="_blank">consider how the character&#8217;s emotional arc changes over the course of the entire story</a>: <em>He begins insecure. He ends confident.</em> But few think about how the character&#8217;s emotional arc develops over the course of a single scene.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q70ITGY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00Q70ITGY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=VPEEIRCUUJF26YJO" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-8463 " src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Book-on-Acting-Stephen-Book.jpg" alt="Book on Acting Stephen Book" width="184" height="263" /></a>In my research last spring, I came across a fascinating guide called <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q70ITGY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00Q70ITGY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=VPEEIRCUUJF26YJO" target="_blank"><em>Book on Acting</em></a>. The title arises from the author&#8217;s name, Stephen Book. He&#8217;s a famous acting teacher. Book directs actors to consider how their characters&#8217; emotions develop over a scene. He calls this the character&#8217;s emotional arc. I quickly realized this was great advice for writers too.</p>
<p><a title="As TV Evolves, a Glaring Problem: Characters Who Don't Change" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/02/as-tv-evolves-a-glaring-problem-characters-who-dont-change/253454/" target="_blank">A character whose emotions don&#8217;t develop or change</a> in a scene is static and not terribly interesting. On the other hand, a character who is jumping from one emotion to another in each paragraph is unlikely to seem believable. So it&#8217;s important to create limited, focused changes.</p>
<h2>1. Change the Intensity of Your Character&#8217;s Emotional Arc</h2>
<p>The simplest type of a character&#8217;s emotional arc is a change in intensity. The basic emotion remains the same, but the intensity of it changes over the scene.</p>
<p>For example, a character may feel happy in a scene, but the intensity of his happiness may change, starting at its lowest intensity as calmness and then building through contentment, pleasure, amusement, gladness, happiness, cheerfulness, giddiness, jubilation, elation, joy.</p>
<p>Generally, it&#8217;s more powerful to show the emotional intensity increasing rather than decreasing. You don&#8217;t want to start the scene with the emotion too high, because then there&#8217;s no room to build. When you do increase the intensity of the emotion, it shouldn&#8217;t happen too quickly&#8211;unless something startling drives it&#8211;so it seems believable.</p>
<p>One common weakness in a character&#8217;s emotional arc is plateauing, reaching a certain level of intensity and then just staying there. Every arc doesn&#8217;t need to start at the lowest level of intensity and go all the way to the highest&#8211;for example, from calmness to joy. You could just as well go from amusement to happiness. But reaching happiness <a title="Structuring Your Story’s Scenes, Pt. 4: Options for Conflict in a Scene" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2012/12/structuring-your-storys-scenes-pt-4.html" target="_blank">halfway through the scene</a> and then leaving the character stuck there makes the events in the scene seem less important, since they have no emotional impact on the character.</p>
<h2>2. Switch From One &#8220;Emotion Family&#8221; to Another</h2>
<p>A more complex type of a character&#8217;s emotional arc involves not just changes in intensity, but changes between emotion &#8220;families.&#8221; Book calls these changes &#8220;emotion switches.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, a character might be in the happiness emotion arc we discussed above. Perhaps his boss is telling him he performed well over the past year, and as she makes several compliments, the character&#8217;s happiness increases from contentment, to pleasure, to gladness, to cheerfulness, to elation when his boss says he&#8217;s getting a big promotion. The boss then suggests they should go out to dinner to celebrate. This triggers an emotion switch to a new arc, which we might call fear. He might begin at a very low level of fear, feeling cautious (is this sexual harrassment or is he misreading her?), then build to nervousness, anxiety, apprehension.</p>
<p>Similar to the single-emotion arc, the emotion switch should generally start with the second emotion at a somewhat low level of intensity, so there&#8217;s room to increase it. In order for a character to switch from one emotion family to another, the scene needs to offer an important event to trigger the shift.</p>
<p>You can see a great example of an emotion switch in this scene from the movie <em>Goodfellas</em>. For those unfamiliar with the movie, these characters are mobsters. Tommy (Joe Pesci, the guy doing most of the talking) is in charge, and he has an explosive temper, as has been established earlier. Watch how Henry (played by Ray Liotta, the guy with the cigarette on the right) becomes more and more happy, until Tommy asks, &#8220;What do you mean I&#8217;m funny?&#8221; There you see Henry&#8217;s emotion switch to fear, and you can see it grow and grow. This is one of the strongest scenes in the movie because of the powerful emotions conveyed and the threat underlying everything.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Goodfellas-Im-Funny-How.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-8464 aligncenter" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Goodfellas-Im-Funny-How.jpg" alt="Goodfellas I'm Funny How" width="459" height="258" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Up the Complexity With &#8220;Umbrella Arcs&#8221;</h2>
<p>According to Book, an umbrella arc is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;an accumulation of separate feelings from different emotion families that adds up to a singular emotional response.</p></blockquote>
<p>Umbrella arcs describe more complex emotional states. Your character may be feeling several emotions at once within an overarching umbrella. These umbrella arcs may be labeled with conceptual terms, such as abandonment, betrayal, or denial, which are not emotions in themselves but can carry emotions.</p>
<p>For example, abandonment may bring with it emotions of hurt, loss, fear, sorrow, and anger. The character may be feeling a combination of all these at once. However, he shouldn&#8217;t be jumping back and forth between these emotions. That would feel too random and disjointed. Perhaps he&#8217;s feeling hurt, loss, and fear, but the fear grows stronger over the scene, or he shifts from predominant hurt to predominant fear, due to some turning point.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to acknowledge that people experience emotions differently, so &#8220;happiness&#8221; may not go through the same gradations for one person as for another. Similarly, people feeling an umbrella concept like &#8220;abandonment&#8221; won&#8217;t have the same exact combination of emotions. Dig deep to discover the emotions characteristic for each of your characters.</p>
<p>What I see often in the work of developing writers are characters whose emotions wax and wane several times in a scene, leaving us with no clear sense of progression&#8211;or characters whose emotions move from one feeling to the next to the next with no sense of focus or <a title="Most Common Writing Mistakes: Are You Confusing Readers With Poor Cause and Effect?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2011/02/most-common-mistakes-series-are-you-2.html" target="_blank">causal connection</a>&#8211;or characters who seem to feel the same emotion at the same intensity through the whole scene&#8211;or characters who feel nothing at all. Becoming more aware of how you want to shape your character&#8217;s emotional arc in each scene can lead you to much more powerful scenes.</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: What is your character&#8217;s emotional arc in your most recent scene?</strong></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week’s video learn how to write backstory that matters to your story and entrances readers with its possibilities.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/YBunWUDHSow" width="640" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>Video Transcript:</h2>
<p><strong>I get a lot of questions about backstory:</strong></p>
<p>How much should you include?</p>
<p>Where should you put in your book?</p>
<p>When should you put it?</p>
<p>And these are all really good questions. <a title="Do you know the right way to use backstory?" href="http://www.plottopunctuation.com/blog/show/25" target="_blank">Backstory is a crucial part of any book</a> because it’s what creates a broader view of your story, a deeper context. In many respects,<strong> <em>backstory</em> is what will bring your characters to life</strong> and <a title="The Secret to Writing a Protagonist Who’s Both Unique and Universal" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/12/writing-a-protagonist.html" target="_blank">convince readers they’re living, breathing people</a> who have a dimensional existence even outside of the story itself. So never discount backstory.</p>
<p>But perhaps because of its very importance, backstory can be tricky to handle. <strong>Writers often end up <a title="Discover the Perfect Place to Insert Backstory" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2011/06/discover-perfect-place-to-insert_15.html" target="_blank">throwing the entirety of their backstory at their readers at the wrong moment</a>.</strong> So how do you know the right moment?</p>
<p>I’m going to go out on a limb—but not very far—and say that t<strong>he <em>only</em> rule about backstory that truly matters to the success of your story is finding that right moment.</strong> Fortunately, there’s a secret hack to make this all much simpler.</p>
<p>And that is this: <strong><em>Never share your character’s backstory until the last possible moment</em>,</strong> right before whenever readers will be hopelessly confused <em>without</em> knowing the backstory. Hint all you like, but <a title="How to Weave Backstory Into Your Novel Seamlessly" href="http://www.writersdigest.com/online-editor/how-to-weave-backstory-seamlessly-into-your-novel" target="_blank">don’t actually share the facts of that delicious backstory until you have to</a>.</p>
<p>Joon-ho Bong’s post-apocalyptic <em>Snowpiercer</em> is a good example of this, and it gives a little extra boost of depth and subtext to an otherwise relatively simple and plot-heavy story. Right away, we learn the main character <em>has</em> a backstory—and that it’s an interesting backstory, because he’s obviously haunted by it. <strong>But does Bong tell us right away what this backstory is?</strong> Nope. Does he tell us in <a title="The Secrets of Story Structure, Pt. 3: The First Act" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2012/03/secrets-of-story-structure-pt-3-first.html" target="_blank">the First Act</a>? Nope. <a title="The Secrets of Story Structure, Pt. 6: The First Half of the Second Act" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2012/04/secrets-of-story-structure-pt-6-first.html" target="_blank">Second Act</a>? Nuh-huh. He doesn’t tell us until more than <em>three-quarters</em> of the way through the story, just before the <a title="The Secrets of Story Structure, Pt. 10: The Climax" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2012/04/secrets-of-story-structure-pt-10-climax.html" target="_blank">Climax</a>.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of waiting, but <strong>it works beautifully because it never burdens readers with information they don’t care about.</strong> Hook your readers in with a hint to make them care, and hold off on your big reveal until the last possible moment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Brevity is the soul of wit.&#8221; However, creating that quality of brevity isn&#8217;t so much about writing <em>short</em> as it is about making every word count. As we continue to discuss the most common writing mistakes, we&#8217;d be remiss to leave out the all-too-prevalent faux pas of unnecessary filler or padding.</p>
<h2>The 4 Reasons Unnecessary Filler Might Be Happening in Your Story</h2>
<p>Unnecessary filler is almost always the result of one of four problems:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The writer is <a title="tuck for Ideas? 20 Quotes Telling You What To Write About" href="http://writetodone.com/stuck-for-ideas-20-quotes-what-to-write-about/" target="_blank">still trying to discover what he wants to say</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>The writer is <a title="Killing Your Darlings: Learn to Self-Edit Like Joss Whedon" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2009/01/killing-your-darlings.html" target="_blank">too in love with his own words</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>The writer isn&#8217;t confident in and/or is <a title="Why Self-Conscious Writers Are Doomed" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2012/05/why-self-conscious-writers-are-doomed.html" target="_blank">avoiding what he <em>really</em> needs to be writing about</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>The writer <a title="Subtext: The Art of Iceberging" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2008/08/subtext-art-of-iceberging.html" target="_blank">doesn&#8217;t trust the reader to understand the subtext</a>.</p>
<h2>How to Clog Your Scenes With Unnecessary Filler</h2>
<p>How can you spot unnecessary filler when it shows up in your story? The first symptom is always that <a title="Save Readers From Boredom: Five Fool-Proof Preventatives" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2011/06/posts-13.html" target="_blank">it&#8217;s boring</a>. If there&#8217;s no life in the scene&#8211;if it&#8217;s high point is just two characters exchanging monotone dialogue about a subject readers either already understand or simply don&#8217;t care about&#8211;that&#8217;s a good sign it&#8217;s a bad scene.</p>
<p>Another sign of filler is <a title=" 6 Fillers to Avoid in Dialogue" href="http://authorculture.blogspot.com/2011/03/6-fillers-to-avoid-in-dialogue.html" target="_blank">a scene that&#8217;s full of social conventions or routine conversations</a> that readers either participate in themselves in their daily lives or are super-familiar with from television and other books. Personal introductions and daily routines are frequent culprits, but so are court-room rhetoric, the Miranda rights, most political speeches, ordering at restaurants, and chatting with grocery clerks&#8211;among other things.</p>
<p><a title="Most Common Writing Mistakes, Pt. 34: Repetitive Dialogue" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/10/repetitive-dialogue.html" target="_blank">Anything repetitious</a> is almost <em>always</em> going to end up (at the best) being unnecessary filler. If readers were with your character when she got the bad news about her cancer at the doc&#8217;s office, then they don&#8217;t need a blow-by-blow recap when she asks for prayer in church.</p>
<p>Consider the following clogged-up scene:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Diana sat in her American history class and doodled in her notebook.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The teacher, Miss Kyle, scribbled her name on the chalkboard, then faced the class. &#8220;Good morning, everyone. I&#8217;m Miss Kyle. I&#8217;m going to be teaching you American History. But, first, roll call.&#8221; She consulted her clipboard. &#8220;Peter Parker?&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Here.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Bruce Wayne?&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Here.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Hal Jordan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Here.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Diana Prince.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Here,&#8221; Diana mumbled.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Miss Kyle finished roll call, then grabbed her brick of a history book off her desk. &#8220;And now, let&#8217;s all turn to page 12 and learn about the disappearing settlers at the Roanoke Colony.&#8221; She started reading.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say Miss Kyle&#8217;s selected passage about the Roanoke Colony is super-important to your plot. <em>Even supposing</em> that, this scene is still nothing but fluff. We might even go so far as to overlook the complete lack of a goal from Diana and the equally complete absence of any conflict between her and her super pals. But what we still can&#8217;t get past is the absolute uselessness of all this routine chalkboard-writing, roll-calling, and history-book-reading. It&#8217;s filler, plain and simple.</p>
<h2>How to Clean Up Your Scenes by Keeping Them Tight and Focused</h2>
<p>Fixing this one of our most common writing mistakes is easy-peasy. <a title="How to Cut the Filler and Tighten Your Book" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2012/12/how-to-cut-filler-and-tighten-your-book.html" target="_blank">If it&#8217;s filler, cut it</a>. And keep right on cutting until you get to the part where something good actually starts happening. Anything crucial in this section&#8211;such as all that juicy info about Roanoke&#8211;can be framed much better in a scene that actually matters to your story.</p>
<p>Sometimes filler can end up being an authorial darling. We had so much fun writing that scene! All those alter-ego names? Squee! Our inner nerd is geeking out. Just the thought of axing it raises a tear.</p>
<p>Sadly, however, squeeing is not reason enough to keep a scene. Work your nerd moment into a different, most integral scene, or just surrender to the fact that it really does belong on the cutting-room floor.</p>
<p>Our previously clogged-up scene might end up looking completely (and blessedly) unrecognizable:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Diana ran into school, late for History once again.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Carol Danvers caught up in the hall. &#8220;Crazy homework project, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Homework? Diana stopped short. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to believe this&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Carol gaped. &#8220;You forgot to do your homework&#8211;<em>again? </em>And it was really cool this time: that whole Roanoke thing with the disappearing settlers. I swear one of the drawings in the book looked just like you. How could you have missed that?&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A chill prickled Diana&#8217;s arm. &#8220;They looked like me?&#8221; This was the clue that would unravel the whole mystery of her existence! And she&#8217;d almost missed it.</p>
<p>Turns out we don&#8217;t even need to be in class with Diana when her teacher starts expounding about Roanoke. And we definitely don&#8217;t need to meet Miss Kyle or hear that egregious roll call. Even better, this version spices things up with an actual goal and some actual conflict.</p>
<p>Now, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with <em>writing </em>all this filler. Sometimes we just need to get it out of our systems. And sometimes we need to write <em>through</em> the filler in order to find the true heart of any given scene. But don&#8217;t get attached to useless blathering. As soon as you recognize the core of your scene, go back and cut out all the unnecessary filler leading up to it. The result will be a lean, mean, fascinatingly on-point story readers won&#8217;t be able to resist.</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: Can you identify any recent filler scene in your work-in-progress? How do you deal with this 37th of our most common writing mistakes?</strong></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three years ago I embarked upon an insane journey to do novel research on a series about a world I knew almost nothing about. Fortunately, I was rescued from this shaky course when I found a technical consultant who is an expert on the subject. And not just any expert: <em>the</em> expert.</p>
<p>My subject was the NYPD Bomb Squad. The expert I engaged to advise me was the active commander of that elite unit, Lt. Mark Torre.</p>
<p>Having worked as a Doubleday editor and as a literary agent, and then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/J.E.-Fishman/e/B004WSLWQ2/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1420135907&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=UK6R6I2CHP7JLWYQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">having written three novels</a>, I came to this project with an understanding of plot, character, dramatic structure, etc. What I knew less about—well, to be completely honest, what I knew <em>next to nothing</em> about—was the inner workings of any kind of police work.</p>
<p>Oh, of course I’d read books and articles and seen my share of cop movies. But in fictional treatments of any subject, facts always take a back seat to story. Which is to say, if facts are in conflict with good storytelling, the facts will suffer, not the other way around. This is acknowledged, tongue in cheek, by the movie <em>American Hustle,</em> based on the FBI ABSCAM operation, which opens with the notice: “Some of this actually happened.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/American-Hustle-Christian-Bale-Bradley-Cooper.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-8306 aligncenter" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/American-Hustle-Christian-Bale-Bradley-Cooper.jpg" alt="American Hustle Christian Bale Bradley Cooper" width="357" height="238" /></a></p>
<h2>No Amount of Novel Research (of the Reading and Watching Variety) Can Substitute for a Real Expert</h2>
<p>Even nonfiction books have a point of view that may not comport with your fact-based goal as a novelist, which is mostly to <a title="How Much Realism Does Your Novel REALLY Need?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/11/much-realism-novel-really-need.html" target="_blank">create verisimilitude in service to your story</a>. And, to make matters worse, <a title="The 14 Most Offensively Inaccurate Historical Movies Of All Time  Read more: http://www.crushable.com/2014/05/02/entertainment/most-historically-inaccurate-movies-ever-list/#ixzz3NaxGQuYn" href="http://www.crushable.com/2014/05/02/entertainment/most-historically-inaccurate-movies-ever-list/" target="_blank">books and movies often get stuff wrong</a>.</p>
<p>For example, in the beginning I hooked up with a man who was then an FBI bomb tech (his official rank was SABT: Special Agent Bomb Technician). He turned out not to be the technical consultant I needed, because the FBI ain’t the NYPD. But we became friends, and one day he explained to me that the smoke used for IED explosions in the movie <em>Hurt Locker</em> was the wrong color. I won’t go into specifics on that here, but suffice to say, if I relied on that movie for my information I’d be misinformed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Hurt-Locker-Jeremy-Renner.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-8307 aligncenter" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Hurt-Locker-Jeremy-Renner.jpg" alt="Hurt Locker Jeremy Renner" width="359" height="217" /></a></p>
<h2>Five Reasons to Use a Technical Consultant for Novel Research</h2>
<p>If you’re writing about a world you know intimately (maybe you were a reporter on the subject or you worked extensively in the field), you might not need an outsider’s expert advice. But if that doesn’t describe you—if, like me, you’re “only” a writer—consider these arguments for getting hold of someone to act as technical consultant on your novel research.</p>
<h3>1. Details Matter</h3>
<p>A novel&#8211;indeed, any work of art&#8211;<a title="Does Your Story Maintain Consistency in the Details?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2011/05/does-your-story-maintain-consistency-in.html" target="_blank">requires the accretion of details</a>. If you get basic facts wrong regarding equipment or procedures, you run the risk that educated readers will stop to question whether something is true. If that happens, <a title="Are you in danger of losing your readers’ suspension of disbelief?" href="http://www.standoutbooks.com/suspension-of-disbelief/" target="_blank">you have knocked the reader out of your story</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Learn the Unexpected</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N28SPD6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00N28SPD6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=M4XWWMODFZFWUZ44" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignright wp-image-8309 size-full" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Blast-From-the-Past-J.E.-Fishman-NYPD-Bomb-Squad.jpg" alt="Blast From the Past J.E. Fishman NYPD Bomb Squad" width="162" height="250" /></a>Library or internet research can teach us a lot of things, but generally we find what we’re looking for and little else. If you have a good relationship with your technical consultant, you might trip upon novelist’s gold just from a casual conversation. I got the idea for an entire book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0990714217/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0990714217&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=P5O6S2KNNFQCVANF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blast from the Past</a>,</em> as a result of something my technical consultant casually brought up over dinner.</p>
<h3>3. Nothing Tastes Like Flavor</h3>
<p>A bit of dialog. The argot of a subculture. How people with your character’s specialty think. These things are hard to come by in conventional research. They are much more easily obtained from someone who works in the trenches.</p>
<h3>4. Get Inoculated</h3>
<p>Every novelist knows (or soon learns) that trolls lurk out there just waiting to make us look stupid. If some technical detail sounds implausible to readers hoping to find fault in my novels, the fact that the commander of the NYPD Bomb Squad vetted every word should give them pause.</p>
<h3>5. The Media Love an Expert</h3>
<p>My technical consultant cannot help me promote due to NYPD regulations. Some people, however, are lucky to have a technical consultant who can make herself available for promotion. It’s tough for a novelist to get attention. A “nonfiction” promotional element might just put you over the top.</p>
<h2>You&#8217;ve Got a Technical Consultant? Now Use Him!</h2>
<p>The better your relationship with your technical consultant, the more help you will get on all five of these fronts. When I’m working on a book in the Bomb Squad NYC series, I tap my consultant early and often in these important ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>I run <a title="Story Concept and Story Premise: Do You Know the Crucial Difference?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/10/story-concept.html" target="_blank">the premise</a> by him.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes I ask him to review <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005NAUKAC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005NAUKAC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=K76WUCT2YZEKOACE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">my outline</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For <a title="5 Ways to Write a Killer Plot Twist" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/07/5-ways-to-write-killer-plot-twist.html" target="_blank">important plot twists,</a> I ask advice regarding plausibility and other details while I’m plotting or writing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Occasionally—not too often to wear out my welcome—we just shoot the breeze over the phone or dinner. On such occasions, I listen carefully to his stories to hear how he talks and see how he relates to his bosses and the men who report to him.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When I have a first draft, he reads every word and offers feedback with regard to what is realistic and what isn’t.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s worth remembering that the technical consultant is not the storyteller. Ultimately, the story takes precedence over everything but public safety (I’ll never reveal a detail that knowingly endangers law enforcement or the public). Although my technical consultant has made every book in the series better and more realistic, we both remember it’s my book to write, not his.</p>
<p>Discovering a technical consultant for your novel research enables you to wade into a subject you otherwise know little about&#8211;and it gives readers confidence to suspend their disbelief while engaging with your story.</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: What kind of technical consultant would you like to work with on your novel research?</strong></h3>

<p>And what about 2015? For the most part, 2015 seems to be shaping up to be the Year of the Novel for me. My two major projects will be finishing up edits on my historical dieselpunk story <em><a title="Storming" href="http://www.kmweiland.com/about-k-m-weiland/#storming" target="_blank">Storming</a> </em>to get it ready for publication in late fall or early winter and writing the first draft of my historical superhero story <a title="Wayfarer" href="http://www.kmweiland.com/about-k-m-weiland/#wayfarer" target="_blank"><em>Wayfarer</em></a>.</p>
<p>Since 2014 was (as you can see) primarily focused on non-novel stuff, I’m dancing all over with the chance to immerse myself in fictional worlds once again. However, I’m also hoping to work on a handful of writing how-to projects for you all as well. My big goal is to finish a couple of courses, one based on <em>Outlining Your Novel</em> and one on <em>Structuring Your Novel</em>. I also have a <a title="Most Common Writing Mistakes Series" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/category/most-common-writing-mistakes" target="_blank">Most Common Writing Mistakes</a> book waiting in the wings. It’s going to be a fun year!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Quick! You&#8217;ve got less than a minute to convince me your story is worth my time. What do you tell me? You&#8217;ve got to pique my curiosity with mystery and potential, while still conveying the bulk of the plot, theme, and general tone. <em>No problem!</em> you say. But when you sit down to actually figure out how to pitch your novel in such a stellar way, you realize these two ingredients aren&#8217;t necessarily going to be compatible within the confines of such a short description.</p>
<p>Your story&#8217;s hook and your story&#8217;s heart aren&#8217;t the same thing. What your story is really about&#8211;its heart, its core&#8211;may not be its hook at all. Fortunately, when you realize this, it suddenly makes the whole job of cramming <em>both</em> into your pitch or back-cover summary about a mega-billion times easier. This revelation goes beyond just <a title="How to Pitch Your Novel Crafting and Delivering the Perfect Writer's Conference Pitch " href="http://fictionwriting.about.com/od/thebusinessofwriting/a/How-To-Pitch-Your-Novel.htm" target="_blank">learning how to pitch your novel in the most effective way</a>. The differences between your story&#8217;s hook and your story&#8217;s heart will affect every page you write. The sooner you figure out which is which&#8211;and how to best optimize them both&#8211;the better your book will be.</p>
<h2>What Is Your Story&#8217;s Heart?</h2>
<p><a title="Writing the Heart of Your Story" href="http://www.livewritethrive.com/2014/06/30/writing-the-heart-of-your-story/" target="_blank">Your story&#8217;s heart is what it&#8217;s all about, way down at its center.</a> This is the soul of your story. If it&#8217;s a love story, a thriller, a coming-of-age story&#8211;that&#8217;s going to be a fundamental aspect of your story&#8217;s heart. But we&#8217;re talking more than just genre here.</p>
<p>The heart of your story is its essence. It&#8217;s the <em>point</em>. The easiest way to figure out your story&#8217;s heart is to ask yourself two questions:</p>
<h3>1. Why are you writing this story?</h3>
<p>If the answer is, &#8220;I love romance&#8221; or &#8220;I want to make a difference in young people&#8217;s lives&#8221; or &#8220;I had an idea for a political drama set on Mars&#8221;&#8211;then that&#8217;s a great starting place for identifying your story&#8217;s heart.</p>
<h3>2. What&#8217;s the story about?</h3>
<p><a title="6 Reasons a Premise Sentence Strengthens Your Story" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2010/07/6-reasons-premise-sentence-strengthens.html" target="_blank">When your BFF asks what you&#8217;re writing, what do you tell her?</a> &#8220;It&#8217;s a story about a kid who ends up in the prison on Rikers Island, where he is inspired to turn his life around, thanks to the school there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe that was the exact answer Paul Volponi gave regarding his YA novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030CVR2U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0030CVR2U&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=YWUVLBC3RLG76WHO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Rikers High</i></a>. It&#8217;s a snappy summary of his story&#8217;s <em>main thrust</em>. Other stuff happens in his book, but this is the point. This is the heart.</p>
<h3>Examples of Story Hearts</h3>
<p>Consider the beating heart of a few more stories:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A man with the ability to jump through space to anywhere in the world is captured by people trying to harness his abilities. (<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YXXKJI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003YXXKJI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=OZ3CURHBRKDOU7UF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Reflex</a> </em>by Steven Gould)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A weakling prince is sold into slavery, where he searches for faith and grows into a warrior while fighting as a gladiator. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UFURVW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005UFURVW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=6YYV5CUJU3OLKAOA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Light of Eidon</em></a> by Karen Hancock)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Edward Rochester&#8217;s first wife struggles to maintain her sanity in the face of his casual cruelty and their loveless marriage. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393308804/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0393308804&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=EUVWPKWJUVI4V4RH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em></a> by Jean Rhys)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Reflex-Steven-Gould-Light-of-Eidon-Karen-Hancock-Wide-Sargasso-Sea-Jean-Rhys.png"><img class="wp-image-8166 aligncenter" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Reflex-Steven-Gould-Light-of-Eidon-Karen-Hancock-Wide-Sargasso-Sea-Jean-Rhys.png" alt="Reflex Steven Gould Light of Eidon Karen Hancock Wide   Sargasso Sea Jean Rhys" width="468" height="235" /></a></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice these are all very streamlined descriptions of these stories. They don&#8217;t incorporate <a title="Does Your Story Need Subplots?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2012/04/does-your-story-need-subplots.html" target="_blank">subplots</a> or <a title="5 Ways to Write a Killer Plot Twist" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/07/5-ways-to-write-killer-plot-twist.html" target="_blank">plot twists</a>, because those things are ultimately extraneous trappings to the true of heart of their stories. When you&#8217;re pitching your story, don&#8217;t worry about the extras. Just focus on the true essentials.</p>
<h2>What Is Your Story&#8217;s Hook?</h2>
<p>Now what&#8217;s this about your story&#8217;s hook not being the same thing as your story&#8217;s heart? Granted, sometimes the heart and the hook<em> are</em> the same thing. Or, rather, sometimes the story&#8217;s heart is unique enough to act as a good hook in and of itself. Indeed, the heart should always be specific enough to stand on its own. &#8220;A story of star-crossed lovers&#8221; will never be as effective (in any capacity) as &#8220;two star-crossed teenagers fall in love and, when their families object, end up committing double suicide.&#8221;</p>
<p>But even in the midst of a fabulously specific and unique heart, <a title="How to Craft a Great Hook" href="http://blog.nathanbransford.com/2007/05/how-to-craft-great-hook.html" target="_blank">your hook will almost always be something even more specific and unique</a>. In the <em>Writer&#8217;s Digest</em> feature &#8220;Meet the Agent&#8221; (March/April 2014), literary agent <a title="McIntosh and Otis: Where Literary Legends Are Born" href="http://mcintoshandotis.com/agents/" target="_blank">Elizabeth Winick Rubinstein</a> encourages authors:</p>
<blockquote><p>Really think about your novel’s hook. What makes it stand out? How is it different from all the other novels in my inbox?</p></blockquote>
<p>The hook is what grabs people&#8217;s attention. We&#8217;ve all read coming-of-age stories. We&#8217;ve all read ill-fated love stories. We may even have read stories about kids in juvenile detention or teenagers killing themselves for love. These ideas may be at the heart of some really stupendous stories, but without a hook to grab curiosity, readers will never take a deeper look.</p>
<p>To identify your hook, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<h3>1. Why should the reader care about this story?</h3>
<p>This is the whole reason the hook even exists in the first place. If readers were automatically going to be interested in any ol&#8217; thing you wrote, you wouldn&#8217;t need to bother with the hook. You could tell your tale and trust that readers would share your interest <em>just because</em>. Sadly, it doesn&#8217;t work that way.</p>
<p>So why will readers think this story is interesting? What will make it stand out from the rest of the coming-of-age stories and tragic love stories?</p>
<h3>2. What is the single most interesting and unique element in this story?</h3>
<p>You may be stumped after that first question. Lots of us are. We don&#8217;t always start writing a story because it&#8217;s unique or has a built-in hook. We&#8217;re writing it because we love its heart. And we <em>do</em> love it. But you have to take a look past the surface reasons.</p>
<p>Why did you <em>need</em> to write this story? Why couldn&#8217;t you just go read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IWTWCYS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00IWTWCYS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=UUUEWUXIF2ZXVSFN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Romeo &amp; Juliet</i></a> and call it good? Start looking for <a title="Pitch Perfect: How to Craft Your Book’s Hook" href="http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/guide-to-literary-agents/pitch-perfect-how-to-craft-your-books-hook" target="_blank">the single most interesting element your story has on tap</a>. To narrow that down yet some more, consider what&#8217;s unique about your story. More often than not, that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find your hook.</p>
<h3>Examples of Story Hooks</h3>
<p>So what are our original example stories&#8217; hooks?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Reflex</em>: </strong>A man can jump through space. That&#8217;s relatively unique, even amongst our glut of superhero stories these days (especially in comparison to, say, super-strength). Even better? This potentially super-powered story doesn&#8217;t follow any of the obvious plot tropes from the comics. It&#8217;s not about a superhero using his powers to save the world. It&#8217;s about a freak being hunted, tortured, and having to figure out how to save <em>himself</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Light of Eidon</strong></em>: Consider the elements this story offers: a prince, a weakling, a gladiator, a warrior, a faith crisis. In themselves, none of these are too unique. But combined, they offer some pretty interesting mashups. A weakling prince as the hero? Don&#8217;t see that one very often. A captured prince fighting as a gladiator? Nope. (Although, of course, it&#8217;s a different story when it comes to captured generals fighting as gladiators.) Throw in that crisis of faith (which is really the heart of the story), and suddenly some extremely interesting possibilities begin to surface.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em></strong><strong>:</strong> This one has an instant built-in &#8220;unique factor&#8221;: it&#8217;s a prequel to Charlotte Brontë&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LLOOSWA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00LLOOSWA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=2AKWE5AU677RGREF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Jane Eyre</em></a>, told from the perspective of the mad wife in the attic. This one&#8217;s almost cheating, since <a title="Story Concept and Story Premise: Do You Know the Crucial Difference?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/10/story-concept.html" target="_blank">the hook is built right into the premise</a>. But, of course, it&#8217;s really not cheating at all. We just feel that way, &#8217;cause it makes the rest of us look bad.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve got your story&#8217;s hook figured out, you may be able to work it right into the description of your story&#8217;s heart (as in the descriptions of <em>Rikers High</em> and <em>Romeo &amp; Juliet</em> above). If you can, so much the better, since that practically answers our next question for us.</p>

<h2>How to Pitch Your Novel: Hook First or Heart First?</h2>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve differentiated your story&#8217;s heart and its hook&#8211;and narrowed them both down into short and specific tags, which should come first in your sales pitch to an agent or reader?</p>
<p><em>The hook always comes first.</em></p>
<p>Remember: nobody&#8217;s going to care about the heart of your story until you convince them too. And the only way you&#8217;re going to convince them is by first hooking their curiosity. For that, you&#8217;re always going to want to give them your best shot right away. Present that most interesting and unique thing about your novel right up front. Don&#8217;t save it. Give it to them straight. If you <em>can&#8217;t </em>grab them right away, you&#8217;re sunk. So bring out the big guns!</p>
<p>Depending on the medium you&#8217;re working in (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HRF7WK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002HRF7WK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=KFDBSDEOSA3EKUTN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">query letter</a>, synopsis, <a title="Secret Storytelling Weapon: The Book’s Back Cover" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2008/12/using-and-abusing-oft-overlooked-back.html" target="_blank">back cover copy</a>), you may be limited in how much space you&#8217;ll then have to share the heart of your story. In some instances, it might not be necessary to include it all. All you really care about is reeling people in. They can discover your story&#8217;s heart when they read the book!</p>
<p>But if you are required or have the opportunity to share your story&#8217;s heart, do it as pithily as possible&#8211;and always try to phrase it as a hook of its own. Never <em>tell</em> people what a story is about (&#8220;It&#8217;s a tragic love story.&#8221;). Always <em>show </em>them (&#8220;Two teenagers fall in love at first sight and turn suicidal when their parents object to their getting married a few days later.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Once you have your story&#8217;s heart and your story&#8217;s hook well in hand, you&#8217;ll be ready to meet any potential agent or reader with confidence. But don&#8217;t wait until then! Figure this stuff out before you ever start writing your first draft. Doing so will help you focus on what your story is <em>really</em> about and empower you to build a heart and a hook that will live up to any sales pitch.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Didn’t get what you want for the holidays? It’s hard for writers, because our dreams are so big. Figuring out how to become a successful writer is no easy task. We want to touch people, change lives, grab readers’ attention on long snowy weekends&#8211;and the truth of the matter is that no one can give us the ability to do those things. We can only give them to ourselves.</p>
<p>I am a book coach, and I see firsthand how writers deny themselves the permission to succeed. They do it every day, in ways large and small. Fighting against the tendency is part of the reason writing is so hard. In addition to creating worlds, shaping ideas, and trying to find a way to capture emotion, we have to constantly fight the forces that lead inexorably to failure&#8211;<a title="How to Tell if Your Book Is a Success" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2012/10/how-to-tell-if-your-book-is-success.html" target="_blank">which is not, for most writers, defined as failing to make the bestseller list or to make a mint from their books</a>. It’s defined as failure to start, failure to believe in your work enough to persist, failure to<a title="11 Ways Stay-at-Home Moms (and Other Busy Folks) Can Find Time to Write" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/04/11-ways-stay-at-home-moms-and-other.html" target="_blank"> find enough time in your day to write</a>, failure to finish, failure to do what needs to be done to give your book a fighting chance.</p>
<p>In my experience, the most powerful tool in this fight against failure is knowledge. That is true whether you are talking about which words to put on the page in which order (specific feedback&#8211;knowledge of your own strengths and weaknesses&#8211;counteracts doubt), and it is true about the entire act of creativity itself. Knowledge about which part of the process is the most difficult for you, and knowledge about <em>why</em>, may be the very thing you need to guarantee that <em>this</em> is the year you will finish your book and become a successful author.</p>
<h2>Figuring Out Your Unique Creative Process</h2>
<p>I have developed a list of thirteen steps that every writer must go through in order to write a book and get it into the hands of readers. I call it the Universal Constants of Creativity. The steps don’t necessarily happen in this order for every writer, and some steps represent only a moment, while others can represent years of grueling work. But each step happens and each step is critical.</p>
<p>I have <a title="The	Universal Constants of Creativity" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ku2wyoi4dpfrmw0/The%20Universal%20Constants%20of%20Creativity_PDF.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">provided a link to this list</a> so you can download it and write on it.  Here’s what I suggest you do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read through the list carefully and think hard about the truth of each step in your process. Be honest. The whole point here is to get down to something real.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Circle the steps you know you tend to get stuck on. Pay particular attention to the steps you may not have reached but that cause you to shake in your shoes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Come up with at least two concrete ways to help you get past the roadblocks you have identified.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Commit to those solutions. Commit to your own success. Commit to making 2015 the year you give yourself permission to become a successful author.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The 13 Universal Constants of Creativity</h2>
<h3>1. The Initial Spark</h3>
<p>The moment an idea comes into your mind and you allow yourself to acknowledge it.</p>
<h3>2. Granting Yourself Permission</h3>
<p>The moment when you decide that you are going to bring the idea to fruition.</p>
<h3>3. A Sense of Faith</h3>
<p>A belief that what you are going to create has some kind of meaning.</p>
<h3>4. A Clear Intention</h3>
<p>You consider your audience, set an objective for how you will delight them</p>
<h3>5. Gathering Resources</h3>
<p>You gather the materials, skills, tools, and resources you need to get the job done.</p>
<h3>6. Commitment</h3>
<p>You take a stand and make a commitment to <em>this</em> idea, letting all your other brilliant ideas go for now.</p>
<h3>7. Persistence</h3>
<p>You keep going, despite setbacks and despite doubt.</p>
<h3>8. Communion</h3>
<p>You connect with other artists who speak your language and support your efforts.</p>
<h3>9. Immersion</h3>
<p>You allow yourself to experience the exhilaration of engagement.</p>
<h3>10. Perspective</h3>
<p>You stand back to assess and analyze, and seek the assistance of others who can help you do this.</p>
<h3>11. Revision</h3>
<p>You shape and refine with ruthless courage.</p>
<h3>12. Letting Go</h3>
<p>You decide to finish.</p>
<h3>13. Public Offering.</h3>
<p>You share your creation with the world.</p>
<p>When I present this list to a live class or audience, a dead silence tends to come over the room. People are often stopped cold by the clear knowledge that they have <em>never</em> made a commitment to an idea or that they <em>always</em> deny themselves the joy of immersion. Or they realize in a flash that while they may have mastered dialogue or character development or scene building, they have not paid any attention whatsoever to these underlying forces impeding their creativity.  It can be sobering&#8211;but it can also be exhilarating. You know now what needs to be done. You know how to give yourself permission to become a successful author!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Writers love their beta readers. But let&#8217;s be honest. Beta readers also kinda drive us crazy. Some of them are perfection: as polite, professional, and talented as any in-house editor. But others&#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say their lack of tact and their questionable knowledge of the craft can sometimes leave us howling in frustration. Why isn&#8217;t there a manual for beta reader etiquette&#8211;for how beta readers should conduct themselves and how writers, in turn, should respond?</p>
<p>A few weeks ago on Facebook, a reader asked if I&#8217;d written a post on beta reader etiquette. I hadn&#8217;t, so today I&#8217;m remedying that oversight. Because trading critiques is the time-honored mode of reimbursement between writers, most of us will end up wearing both the beta-reader hat and the being-beta-read hat more times than we can count. In the interest of keeping peace and patience amongst ourselves and, even more importantly, maximizing our helpfulness to one another, let&#8217;s consider ten bits of beta reader etiquette and eight bits of writerly etiquette in response.</p>
<h2>The 10 Rules of Beta Reader Etiquette</h2>
<h3>1. Be Honest</h3>
<p>You can&#8217;t be useful to fellow writers unless you&#8217;re willing to be honest with them: about the good and the bad of their stories. No, you don&#8217;t want to hurt any feelings, but just assume that <a title="Putting Your Writer’s Ego in Your Back Pocket" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2008/06/putting-your-ego-in-your-back-pocket.html" target="_blank">any writer who asks your opinion will be big enough to handle even a negative response</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Be Specific</h3>
<p>Generalities like, &#8220;I loved it!&#8221; or &#8220;Your plot was boring!&#8221; aren&#8217;t going to be much help. Even if you start out with only a gut feeling about the story, do your best to figure out <em>why</em> you liked or disliked something. Give your writer friend something concrete on which to build his revisions.</p>
<h3>3. Couch Criticism in Praise</h3>
<p>The whole point of a critique is the criticism. But be a sport and don&#8217;t be <em>too</em> rough on a writer&#8217;s delicate ego. Say what you gotta say about the book&#8217;s faults, but couch your criticism in praise. Whenever you can, be lavish in your comments on a bo0k&#8217;s good points. Open your critique by telling the writer what you liked best, and sum up with either a generally positive opinion or a belief that the author will be able to refine his rough draft into something good.</p>
<h3>4. Avoid Negative Absolutes</h3>
<p>Insofar as honesty allows, try to avoid negative absolutes: &#8220;This book is awful.&#8221; &#8220;I hated this character.&#8221; &#8220;Your theme is nonexistent.&#8221; Focus on the fix, rather than the problem: &#8220;I recommend using a more cheerful tone.&#8221; &#8220;<a title="Why Your Hero Absolutely Must Pet the Dog" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2011/09/why-your-hero-absolutely-must-pet-dog.html" target="_blank">What if you let this character pet a dog?</a>&#8221; &#8220;Have you considered a theme for this story?&#8221; Even writers who <em>want</em> to hear all your criticism will grow resistant to accepting it if you put them on the defensive.</p>
<h3>5. Observe Deadlines</h3>
<p>Aside from the fact that most writers will be chewing their fingernails with anticipation from the moment they send you their precious manuscript, they&#8217;ve also probably got some serious deadlines to meet. So once you agree to a timeline, try your darndest to meet it. Yes, you&#8217;re doing the writer a favor, but he&#8217;s also depending on you. If you&#8217;re going to be unable to meet the deadline, always take a moment to let the writer know about the delay.</p>
<h3>6. Observe Standard Editing Protocol</h3>
<p>Make things easier for both yourself and the writer by observing standard editing protocol. Either use Word&#8217;s Track Changes to mark your comments and corrections right into the manuscript, or use standard editing symbols for marking up a hardcopy. No need to waste either the writer&#8217;s time or you own with comments he won&#8217;t be able to access or decipher.</p>
<h3>7. Respect the Author&#8217;s Guidelines</h3>
<p>If the author says she&#8217;s only looking for a general overview of the story&#8211;not a line edit&#8211;then respect that. She knows what stage her story is in and what kind of opinion will be most helpful. An unasked for line edit at too early a stage may not only end up wasting your time, but also killing the writer&#8217;s confidence in her story.</p>
<h3>8. Check Your Personal Agenda at the Door</h3>
<p>Remember: as a beta reader, you&#8217;re there to serve the writer, not the other way around. If you have a personal dislike for characters with red hair, the word &#8220;stupendous,&#8221; or rainy scenes, keep it to yourself. There&#8217;s a difference between pet peeves based on technical mistakes and pet peeves that are specific only to us and our personalities.</p>
<h3>9. Identify the Author&#8217;s Vision</h3>
<p>In the same vein as #8, your job is to help the author realize <em>her</em> vision for the story. It&#8217;s definitely not your job to try to impose <em>your</em> vision (or worldview) onto the writer&#8217;s story. If she wrote an adventure story, but you wanted a romance, don&#8217;t take it upon yourself to rewrite the genre. Do your best to figure out what type and tone of story the author is going for, and shape your comments to help her figure out where she&#8217;s falling short of <em>her</em> vision.</p>
<h3>10. Respect the Author&#8217;s Autonomy</h3>
<p>No matter how much effort and time you spend critiquing this story, there is no guarantee the author will make the changes you&#8217;re suggesting. Once you&#8217;ve turned over your critique, let the story go. You&#8217;ve had your say; you&#8217;ve fulfilled your duty. It&#8217;s not your responsibility to talk the writer into using all your suggestions. When the book comes out and the main character still has red hair, resist the urge to throw up your hands in frustration or write the author a scolding email.</p>
<h2>The 8 Rules of Writerly Etiquette in Response to Beta Readers</h2>
<h3>1. Show Gratitude</h3>
<p>Taking the time to read and comment on a manuscript is a <em>humongous</em> favor. Never take that for granted. Even if you should get your manuscript back and end up disagreeing with every single thing the beta reader said, never discount the effort that went into making those comments. Always thank beta readers profusely and let them know you&#8217;re aware of the effort they put into trying to help you.</p>
<h3>2. Don&#8217;t Argue</h3>
<p>Upon reading some (or all) of a beta reader&#8217;s comments, your first instinct might be to argue. But don&#8217;t. Just&#8230; don&#8217;t. If you&#8217;re face to face with a beta reader, simply nod and smile as they explain their thoughts. <em>Only</em> challenge their opinions if you need clarification on a point, and even then make sure you do it with graciousness and humility. No need to let a bossy beta run you over, but try to keep any knee-jerk negative reactions simmered down to a professional, &#8220;That&#8217;s a good point. I&#8217;ll take that into consideration.&#8221;</p>
<h3>3. Don&#8217;t Take Offense</h3>
<p>Yes, you&#8217;ll occasionally run into a nasty beta reader with a personal axe to grind. But generally speaking, most betas aren&#8217;t out to get you&#8211;even when they may sound less than kind in their critiques. Give your betas the benefit of the doubt and assume they just want to help you. Even if they&#8217;re dead wrong about your story, don&#8217;t take offense. This isn&#8217;t personal. It&#8217;s business.</p>
<h3>4. Give the Edit Some Time</h3>
<p>Most of us need a little time to process a critique&#8211;especially if it&#8217;s harsher than we expected. Before outright rejecting a beta reader&#8217;s critique, always give yourself a week or so to process the comments. Step away from the manuscript and just let those initial emotions brew for a while. When you&#8217;ve cleared your head, come back to the critique and evaluate the true worth of the beta reader&#8217;s offerings.</p>
<h3>5. Remember the &#8220;Two People Have to Agree&#8221; Rule</h3>
<p>Just as you shouldn&#8217;t outright reject your beta reader&#8217;s offerings, you also shouldn&#8217;t swallow everything a beta says. My personal rule is that &#8220;two people have to agree&#8221; on a change before I&#8217;ll make it. One of those people can be me: if I immediately recognize the worth of a beta&#8217;s suggestion, obviously I&#8217;ll go ahead and make the change. But if I don&#8217;t agree, I&#8217;ll put the comment on the back burner, where it will stay until another beta reader or editor makes the same comment. If that happens, then I know I have to reevaluate my initial gut feeling.</p>
<h3>6. Respect the Reader&#8217;s Time</h3>
<p>The beta reader is giving you the gift of many, many hours of his time. You&#8217;d be paying a professional editor thousands of dollars to be doing what your beta is doing for free (probable discrepancies in knowledge and skill aside). Respect that gift. Don&#8217;t ask beta readers to adhere to impossibly tight schedules, and once you&#8217;ve agreed upon a reasonable deadline, don&#8217;t pester the beta with requests for progress updates. Only after the deadline has come and gone without response from the beta reader should you send him a gentle email, asking if he&#8217;s had time to look at your book. If he hasn&#8217;t, tell him that&#8217;s all right and look elsewhere for another beta.</p>
<h3>7. Don&#8217;t Request Brainstorming Assistance</h3>
<p>A beta reader isn&#8217;t necessarily a brainstorming buddy. Brainstorming requires almost as much time and effort as critiquing, so don&#8217;t assume that just because someone agreed to read your manuscript he&#8217;ll also want to help you name characters and figure out how to fill plot holes. Pointing out the holes was his job; filling them is yours.</p>
<h3>8. Return the Favor</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s an unspoken rule in the writing world that if you receive a critique, you should also be willing to give one. Offer upfront to return the favor, and when that favor gets called in, do your best to promptly, kindly, and professionally fulfill the duties of the beta reader every bit as well as you&#8217;d like to have them fulfilled <em>for</em> you.</p>
<p>The dance between writer and beta reader can sometimes be a tricky one, since not one, but <em>two</em> big, fat, bruisable writer&#8217;s egos are in play. But figuring out the rules of the dance is always worth the effort. Treat your beta readers with kindness and respect, and always critique other writers in the same measure. When it comes to beta reader etiquette, that&#8217;s really the only rule any of us needs to remember.</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: What do you think is the most important rule of beta reader etiquette?</strong></h3>
