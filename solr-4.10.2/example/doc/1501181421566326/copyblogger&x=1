It was one of the most popular episodes of 2014.</p><p>We did that episode based on a personal project I was already planning to do. I quietly launched that project last month, and it&#8217;s called <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~further.net/">Further</a>. It&#8217;s a curated email newsletter dedicated to living your best life, with features and news items related to health, wealth, and wisdom.</p><p>Here are a few sample issues:</p><ul><li><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~further.net/12-23-2014/">Three Real Ways to Protect and Enhance Your Brain Power</a></li><li><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~further.net/plant-based-versus-paleo/">The Epic Food Fight: Plants Versus Paleo</a></li><li><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~further.net/meditate-to-dominate/">Meditate to Dominate in 2015</a></li></ul><p>Given the initial high interest (and several requests), I&#8217;ve decided to do a &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; case study on myself, revealing what I&#8217;m doing and why, plus what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not.

Even if you&#8217;re not sure about that, there are a lot of fundamental content, copywriting, and entrepreneurial insights throughout.

A prank by some misfit in Boca Raton.</p><p>But I have to confess: part of me wants there to be a goat keeper (somewhere exotic) who is a faithful reader of Copyblogger. An enterprising shepherd who dreams of growing his herd &#8212; with <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com/register/" target="_blank">content marketing</a>.</p><p>Ah, to dream.</p><p>But whether or not the goat keeper is real doesn&#8217;t really matter. It is, however, just one of dozens of interesting discoveries we made during our 2015 <em>Cost of Online Business</em> survey.<span id="more-45199"></span></p><p>Discoveries like:</p><ul><li>More than a quarter of respondents identified as a Small Business Owner.</li><li>Most website owners are struggling to make a living online.</li><li>Yet more and more people are choosing to enter the online business realm.</li><li>Generating traffic is the biggest challenge of running an online business.</li></ul><p>And 53 additional interesting results.</p><p>Results that will help us create content that solves <em>your</em> online business problems and develop new products that better serve your needs. Not to mention allowing us to upgrade our current products based on what matters most to you.</p><p>Naturally, we wanted this information to serve you better. But we thought you needed it, too.</p><p>How can you accurately evaluate your current strategies and tactics &#8212; and their associated costs &#8212; if you don&#8217;t know what other folks are doing and what&#8217;s working for them?</p><p>You need to know your options.</p><h3>The survey results in three ways</h3><p>We&#8217;ve decided to provide the results from the survey in multiple formats. </p><p><strong>First,</strong> in the superb infographic below designed by our very own Lauren Mancke.</p><p>This infographic touches upon the highlights from the 2015 <em>Cost of Online Business</em> survey. At a quick glance you can see the state of the cost of doing business online.</p><p><strong>Second,</strong> you can <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~copyblogger.com/lede-survey-lessons/" target="_blank">listen to a short episode of The Lede</a> where Jerod and I talk about the methodology behind the survey, results that stood out, and lessons learned (one really big one for me).</p><p><strong>Finally,</strong> you can dig a little deeper (which we highly recommend you do) by grabbing our free 58-page ebook, <strong>The 2015 Cost of Online Business Report</strong>, at the end of this post. The report has all the results from the 57-question survey, plus analysis and commentary by Jerod and me.</p><p>As you work through all this material, it&#8217;s possible you&#8217;ll see many opportunities you or your business can take advantage of. And that was the ultimate goal of this survey and report: to give you information that will make you a more informed and savvy online business owner.</p><p>So, enjoy!

You know this. It&#8217;s one of the reasons why content marketing is a proven long play, rather than a scheme to get rich quick. </p><p>But sometimes we overcomplicate things. Sometimes the answer to our question of, &#8220;How do I create the next great piece of content that will help me build my business?&#8221; is staring us right in the face, if only we&#8217;d open our eyes. </p><p>It&#8217;s our audience. Because while you may be creating content in a niche with a thousand other sites, only you have your audience.</p><p>And surveying your audience can be fertile ground for the kind of information and insight that builds your next transformative content series.</p><p>Just ask Demian Farnworth. He did it twice for Copyblogger in 2014. </p><p>We talked about his mentality, his process, and the lessons he learned in the latest episode of The Lede. Demian. How are you?</p><p><strong>Demian Farnworth:</strong> I&#8217;m doing well, friend. Thank you. How are you, Jerod?</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> I am doing very well. Excited to begin another year of Lede podcasts. It should be a fun one.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> I agree. I&#8217;m excited, too.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> A big theme that we&#8217;ve talked about that is popular in a lot in content marketing circles is just how much content there is out there, right? </p><p>It&#8217;s harder now to get noticed because there&#8217;s more content. So to get noticed, to rise above that din, you&#8217;ve got to do something special. </p><p>You&#8217;ve have to create content that is more useful than others, and one way that you do that is create content that says something different. That is unique.</p><h3>Creating a survey to gain insights for a unique content series</h3><p>For anybody who has built an audience, the most unique element that you have that you are in control of is that audience. And it can be very fertile ground for creating the kind of unique, useful content that you need to stand out above the crowd.</p><p>This is how I want to introduce the theme of today&#8217;s Lede podcast, which is surveys, and, specifically, surveying your audience to create unique content. </p><p>It&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve done now twice just in the past year. We did it once last year with our <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/native-advertising-2014/" target="_blank">native advertising series</a>, and we&#8217;ve done it again with the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/2015-online-business-survey/" target="_blank">cost of doing business online survey</a>.</p><p>The results of our latest survey will be posted on Wednesday, January 14, so since that is tomorrow, I wanted to talk with you, Demian, about surveys &#8212; and about your process for creating the surveys. </p><p>What have we learned from these two audience surveys? Can you give our audience some insight?</p><p>Because I think it&#8217;s something they can look at too as an avenue for creating that unique, useful content that&#8217;s needed to stand out above the crowd.</p><p>Let&#8217;s talk about that. Let&#8217;s talk about the surveys that we&#8217;ve done in general, some of your thoughts behind them, and some of the lessons you&#8217;ve learned.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Great opening. This idea of your audience being an asset is something Copyblogger has been preaching for quite a long time, and when we talk about content marketing, we define content marketing, and we say that content marketing is building an audience by educating, informing, and entertaining them.</p><p>And sometimes, instead of using the word &#8220;audience,&#8221; I like to use the word &#8220;market&#8221; because, really, essentially what you&#8217;re after is this idea of creating, building this group of people who will then eventually be interested in buying your products. </p><p>Then you can turn around and say, &#8220;Okay, I fed you all of this free content, and now what is it I can build to help you succeed in your business, in what you do, whatever routine you have? Whatever challenges in life you have. What can I do to help build that? </p><p>The best way to get there, if you think about it, is to <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/rethink-content-marketing/" target="_blank">build that audience</a>, create that content, and keep building that asset, that market of people who are faithful to you, who are advocates for you.</p><p>Eventually you turn around and say, &#8220;What can I do for you?&#8221; That&#8217;s essentially what we&#8217;ve done with this survey.</p><p>It&#8217;s such a powerful tool to use, and often, I think, it gets missed. People don&#8217;t tap into that simply because they don&#8217;t realize that they can do it, and how easy it really is.</p><p>For example, our very first survey that we ever did, which is kind of surprising considering of the age of Copyblogger, was the 2014 native advertising survey. It was 12 questions.</p><p>We asked people basic questions about their understanding of native advertising, their awareness of native advertising, and that exercise was pretty revealing in a sense, because part of that survey was meant to help fuel and inform the following series I was going to write.</p><p>The series turned out to be about five articles. First, I wanted to find out how aware people are of native advertising. From there, results turned out to be that only three percent of those surveyed actually had a solid understanding of native advertising.</p><p>That was a 12-question survey, so it was short.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> And I want to jump in here. </p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Sure.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> That part was very revealing, right?</p><p>I recall being surprised by that response because we&#8217;d been talking so much about native advertising, and obviously in the content marketing cocoon, native advertising had been discussed a lot.</p><p>But we found that a lot fewer people actually recognized it, knew it, and were doing it than we thought, which really highlights the point that you never want to assume, and it&#8217;s better to ask the questions and find out the real answers, right?</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Right. Exactly. Like you said, so often we&#8217;re working off assumptions, but when you have an asset you can test your theories.</p><p>And that&#8217;s the scientific method. Formulate a theory, and then test it, and a survey does that.</p><p>We were all surprised because native advertising was the current buzzword. It seemed like everywhere you looked there was some sort of hotshot talking about native advertising.</p><p>BuzzFeed was talking about it. Mashable. All these different companies were talking about it and doing it, yet when it came down to it, the understanding and awareness within the market was very, very low.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> So you were already planning on doing the native advertising series.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> How do you think the results of the survey informed the series, or possibly even changed the trajectory of the series from where you had initially planned on it going?</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question. I don&#8217;t remember at what point I had done the survey and at what point I had done the research, whether the survey had come before or after it.</p><p>I have a hunch we did the survey first, so I don&#8217;t think I had done the research yet. In a lot of ways it did inform what I was after, and information that I could use.</p><p>For example, it basically also confirms this belief that you should really assume nothing about the sophistication of your audience. Meaning that you should treat them as if they don&#8217;t know anything.</p><p>We often get into this rut of what they call &#8220;the curse of knowledge&#8221; where you think, &#8220;Hey, I know this really well, and so does everybody else. </p><p>The mistake in that is the fact that it&#8217;s just simply not true. Just because you know something doesn&#8217;t mean that somebody else knows it.</p><p>Like the other night, some young man was trying to teach me how to play Euchre. It&#8217;s a card game. And he was saying these words like &#8220;bids,&#8221; &#8220;sets,&#8221; and I knew what they meant, but not in his context.</p><p>He said, &#8220;This will be easy,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;That&#8217;s easy for you to say.&#8221; But that&#8217;s the idea.</p><p>When it came to native advertising, I understood I had to start from the very bottom and define it, and simply keep repeating that definition.</p><p>And if you look back through those articles, I always started each article with the definition of what native advertising is to give people something to sort of anchor themselves on, to steer them. </p><p>I need something to be explained in one sentence or two sentences, very simply and succinctly. And so in that way, that native advertising survey helped me create that series, and just give really concrete examples of native advertising in the wilds like that.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> You said something interesting there about assuming that your audience knows nothing, and you have to be careful with that a little bit, because it can sound condescending.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Right.</p><p>Jerod:</strong> But you don&#8217;t mean in that way, of course.</p><p>It&#8217;s not assumed that your audience are idiots, it&#8217;s just assumed that they don&#8217;t understand this concept yet, but once you explain it to them, they will get it. </p><p>So just make sure that those bases are covered. Don&#8217;t assume everybody knows what you know already.</p><h3>Choosing the right survey methodology</h3><p>I want to talk a little about methodology here, because the native advertising survey, as you mentioned, was short. It was 12 questions. </p><p>The cost of doing business online survey is much longer.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Fifty-seven questions.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Yeah. 57 questions.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Mmm-hmm.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> What were the differences in creating those two surveys? What were some of the lessons that you learned based on how people responded?</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> I knew that was a risk going into the cost of doing business online survey, it being long, because convention tells you keep it short.</p><p>There were a number of comments &#8212; probably two or three comments &#8212; within the survey results that said &#8220;Don&#8217;t you realize that surveys should be short? Anything longer than that, the response will drop.&#8221;</p><p>And the response did drop, but it did not drop nearly as dramatically as we thought it would. In fact, on the very first question we had 449 responses, and the last question had had 421 responses.</p><p>There was a very tiny drop. I expected a drop, but I didn&#8217;t expect that small of a drop, though. So I was really pleased with that.</p><p>The methodology of trying to dig deeper with many questions, within reason, was to uncover what it looked like to run a business online &#8212; whether you sold physical products, or you were talking about digital information, software, that sort of thing.</p><p>I went through many iterations of the survey questions, and I was asking lots of people. I had a number of people, like Chris Brogan and Jeff Goins, take a peek at it, and just tell me: What am I missing here? What sort of questions should I be asking?</p><p>Chris Garrett and Sonia Simone and all of these people looked at the survey and gave feedback. I was really interested in being precise, but I&#8217;d have been much more precise if it had been twice as long a survey.</p><p>But I was really after just figuring out as much as I could uncover. What were the categories? I went after the categories. You know, what were the main categories when running a business?</p><p>And that was from the creation to execution type of thing, to the commerce side, to the securities, security as a category. And then within that, I tried to ask a few questions that got me close to useful information.</p><p>We all talked after we got the results and agreed that for each one of those categories we needed to do another survey that just digs even deeper into that particular information.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> And you know, it&#8217;s interesting too because the two surveys were different, but it all comes down to your goals and what you&#8217;re after.</p><p>The native advertising series was very much about gaining a broad understanding of what people know generally about native advertising. With 12 questions that are somewhat general, there was not a lot of follow-up from one question to the next &#8212; it didn&#8217;t fit the purpose of that kind of survey.</p><p>With this cost of doing business online survey, you could have asked 10 to 12 questions and got thousands of responses, right? Instead you asked 57. We got 449 responses.</p><p>But what&#8217;s really interesting about the data set that we got is you can go and can cross-reference responses. </p><p>For instance, Question 40 may ask, &#8220;How much are you spending on SEO?&#8221; You can see how someone answered that question and then go back and look at what he answered to Question 4, and find out if he&#8217;s barely paying the bills or living comfortably from his online business.</p><p>You get a depth of information with the longer survey that you don&#8217;t get with a shorter one. So again, you&#8217;re sacrificing number of responses for the depth of the responses, and for the online business survey, it made sense to do it that way.</p><p>And that&#8217;s where I think if someone&#8217;s planning their own survey, their own research project like this, you really want to think about what kind of data set do you want to get? What are you going to be using it for?</p><p>For us, with the cost of doing business online survey, we knew we wanted to, obviously, put out a good report, a good educational PDF at the end that everybody could learn from, which I think we did, and we will. That&#8217;s going up tomorrow.</p><p>But also, for our own internal use. This really helps us understand our audience better &#8212; understand what people&#8217;s needs are, what their challenges are.</p><p>And what I love about it is being able to go in there and say, &#8220;Okay. Here&#8217;s this group of people who said that they&#8217;re not experiencing success. How are they answering all of these different questions? Where are the gaps? What are the majority of people who aren&#8217;t having success not doing? Or what are they not investing enough money in?&#8221;</p><p>And that made it really, really valuable.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> As you review the responses to the questions you asked, you&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t think about that. That&#8217;s a surprising find.&#8221;</p><p>Those nuggets that you weren&#8217;t really expecting come to the surface, and that&#8217;s the beauty of doing a survey &#8212; asking these questions and seeing how people respond, and then seeing how the questions relate to each other.</p><p>Because, at first, you&#8217;re not really thinking that way and not expecting responses to relate to one another. </p><p>A lot of this is serendipity in the sense of first sitting down and thinking about this logically, but then when you release it out there, information comes back.</p><p>It comes back in such a way that if you study it, you&#8217;ll see these patterns emerge as we did. And so that&#8217;s really, really interesting. </p><p>Which helps us to then say, &#8220;So what content can we create, and in what format, that can serve these needs for these people? What kind of product can we create to serve these needs that these people are saying that they have in this sort of unique, kind of convergence of data sets?&#8221;</p><h3>How to survey your audience, even if your audience is small and you have limited resources</h3><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> I feel like people who are listening to this probably have two objections in their heads, as they think about applying it to their own sites, their own online businesses.</p><p>One is, &#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t have an audience quite as big as Copyblogger,&#8221; or &#8220;We don&#8217;t have the resources or want to invest the resources to go out and pay for a survey like this.&#8221;</p><p>You can use <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.surveymonkey.com/" target="_blank">SurveyMonkey</a> or <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/home" target="_blank">Google&#8217;s consumer surveys</a>. We actually have a post coming out about this that Sean Jackson wrote. It&#8217;ll come out sometime early this year. He went out and did some tests.</p><p>Now, you have to pay some money to use some of those services, but you can get good data. In terms of the people who are thinking, &#8220;Well, why should we do this? We don&#8217;t have an audience as big as Copyblogger&#8217;s,&#8221; how would you respond to that? </p><p>Because it&#8217;s true. Obviously, we&#8217;ve had almost a decade to build a very responsive audience, which we feel very, very fortunate to have, and we&#8217;re so grateful that people spent the time to take the survey and provide this great data, which we really hope, again, helps inform us and helps us make better editorial and product choices.</p><p>Is it still worth doing even if your audience is smaller?</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> I think it&#8217;s still worth doing. I think even if you had 10 faithful readers, you would treat them the same way as if you had 1,000. </p><p>Just ask. You know, it&#8217;s your audience. Those are the people you should be listening to. And there are lots of free tools out there. For example, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.google.com/forms/about/" target="_blank">Google Forms</a> allows you to create free surveys that you can actually embed on your site.</p><p>Or if you don&#8217;t even want to go that route and you have a small audience, and you have a responsive audience, just create one as a blog post on your website and ask a question.</p><p>Have people respond in the comments, or send you an email. There are lots of very cheap, inexpensive work-arounds to get that information. </p><p>But the practice of surveying is really a discipline, and it&#8217;s one technique inside the discipline of listening to your reader, which we should all be doing.</p><h3>The golden rule of good content</h3><p>You can do surveys right on your blog where you ask for answers informally through comments or email. You can do surveys on Twitter. If you&#8217;ve got only 400 followers, you can still ask them questions and ask the questions repeatedly so they get more exposure.</p><p>You can do that on Facebook. You can do that through email if you want to send an email. But like I said, it&#8217;s part of a broader discipline of actually listening to your audience, which is, I think, the cardinal rule.</p><p>Listening to your customers is the golden rule of good content, first and foremost. </p><p>So figure out how to do that survey, and it doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t have a very big audience at all. You can do it anyway.</p><p>Because it&#8217;s like how you would gain information in any group, even if you had a book club of four people. You would ask them: &#8220;So what book should we read next?&#8221; And they would tell you, and a decision would be made.</p><h3>What we&#8217;ll do differently when conducting our next survey</h3><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> If you could do either survey over again &#8212; native advertising or the cost of doing business online &#8212; what would you do differently, if anything?</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question. The biggest mistake that I made on this last one, the cost of online business survey, was that I did not allow for people to choose multiple options.</p><p>It was one of those oversights. I was so concerned about all these other portions and getting these things right and testing it that it just didn&#8217;t even occur to me that some of these questions were phrased in such a way that demanded the opportunity for multiple checkpoints.</p><p>That&#8217;s the biggest lesson in that one &#8212; in the future instead of radio buttons where they exclude other answers, we will use check boxes so people can check as many as they want. </p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> If you&#8217;re listening to this episode of The Lede on Tuesday when it comes out, the cost of online business report based on our survey results will be on the Copyblogger blog tomorrow, Wednesday.</p><p>If you&#8217;re listening to this at some other point in the future, just tweet us: @JerodMorris or @DemianFarnworth, and we can send you a link to the cost of online business report, because I think there&#8217;s a lot of information in there that people will get a lot of value out of. We certainly did.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Yeah, and just to let people know, too, Jerod, Stefanie, and I all reviewed the responses and added analysis and commentary to a good majority of the questions in the report.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Any particular responses from the cost of online business survey that stand out? I was particularly fond of the person who responded &#8220;Goat Keeper.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> I was impressed with that one. My favorite comment was under the question, &#8220;How successful is your online business?&#8221; And the response was, &#8220;I&#8217;m 22, and I&#8217;m driving a $70,000 Mercedes. I don&#8217;t know, you tell me.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> I&#8217;d say that guy has got it going on.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Yes. He&#8217;s got something going on.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> All right. Well, we certainly learned a lot from the surveys, and I think it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ll continue to do.</p><p>If you&#8217;re in a crowded niche, or we look at just how much content is out there, it&#8217;s hard to see what you can do that&#8217;s unique sometimes. </p><p>But remember that you are the only person with your audience, and so that is one sure-fire way to get unique content ideas.</p><p>Talk with your audience. Find out what they&#8217;re thinking. Let them answer some questions. Learn from them, and then see what kind of helpful, useful content you can turn that into, because that is going to be unique.</p><p>So, with that said, Demian, another fun episode of The Lede.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Indeed. In the books, right?</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Yes. In the books.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> In the books.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> We&#8217;ll be back in a couple of weeks with another one. </p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> And I will be in the books until then.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> (Laughs) All right. Sounds good, man.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Take care. Bye.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Thank you very much for listening to this episode of The Lede. We&#8217;re excited to be back for another year of every-other-week episodes in 2015. </p><p>And if you enjoyed this episode, and if you&#8217;ve been enjoying past episodes, please consider giving the show a rating or a review on iTunes. We would definitely appreciate it. </p><p>Don&#8217;t forget to go to <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~AuthorityRainmaker.com" target="_blank">authorityrainmaker.com</a>. The early bird pricing won&#8217;t be around much longer. </p><p>And just know that the vast amount of actionable information you will learn at this year&#8217;s event will be surpassed only by the incredible amount of fun that you&#8217;ll have simultaneously.</p><p>I know. I was there last year. I&#8217;ll be there this year. And I hope to see as many of you there as possible as well.</p><p>All right, everybody. We&#8217;ll be back in two weeks with another episode of The Lede. Hopefully you build a bunch of positive new year momentum in the meantime. Talk to you soon. Serve boldly.</p><p></div></div><p><em>*Credits: Both the intro (<a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~samrobertsband.com/discography/Chemical+City/Bridge+to+Nowhere/" target="_blank">&#8220;Bridge to Nowhere&#8221;</a> by <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.samrobertsband.com/" target="_blank">Sam Roberts Band</a>) and outro songs (<a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.theheadandtheheart.com/releases/the_head_and_the_heart" target="_blank">&#8220;Down in the Valley&#8221;</a> by <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.theheadandtheheart.com/" target="_blank">The Head and the Heart</a>) are graciously provided by express written consent from the rights owners.</em></p><div class="author-box"><div><img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f381b51fbadc229e378a27d6546541d2?s=100&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D100&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-100 photo' height='100' width='100' /> <span class="subheading">About the author</span><h3>Jerod Morris</h3><br><p>Jerod Morris is the VP of Marketing for Copyblogger Media.

In fact, the feeling it engenders is something more like phobia, or at least dread.</p><p>(If you have a friendlier term than <em>audit</em>, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.linkedin.com/groups/HELP-We-need-new-term-8117878.S.595859283033413632" target="_blank">come swing by LinkedIn</a> and make your suggestion &#8212; I&#8217;m all ears. Maybe a content makeover. Or a content cleanse. Hm, definitely needs work.)</p><p><span id="more-46307"></span>Content audits get conducted for all kinds of reasons, often to ensure that content is well optimized to be discovered by search.</p><p>But, as we know, the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/seo-copywriting/" target="_blank">smartest SEO strategy in 2015</a> (and the foreseeable future) is to build a robust, interesting site with a lot of audience-satisfying content. So our audit will focus on those qualities &#8212; which might make things a little more fun as well.</p><p>If you want to give your site a fresh, clean start for the New Year, why not join us? Here are some thoughts:</p><h3>Getting started</h3><p>If your site&#8217;s big, I&#8217;d suggest mobilizing your entire content team. If you&#8217;re on your own, that&#8217;s fine as well &#8212; but you&#8217;ll need to prioritize and work your way through your most important content.</p><p>For larger sites, start with the most important pages &#8212; typically the ones that are already getting the best traffic. If you don&#8217;t have a lot of content yet, just work from oldest to newest &#8212; that will give fresh eyes to material you haven&#8217;t seen in awhile.</p><h3>What do you want your content mix to look like?</h3><p>One of the benefits of a content audit is you can get a good sense of what <em>The Whole Thing</em> looks like.</p><p>Before you do that, though, give some thought to what you <em>want</em> it to look like.</p><p>Some types of content attract new visitors, some strengthen your relationships, and some pave the way for a sale. What would be the ideal mix for your site?</p><p>(If content strategy is tricky for you, pick up two free ebooks from Brian Clark in our member library &#8212; <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~my.copyblogger.com/basic/agile-marketing-eboo/" target="_blank">The Business Case for Agile Content Marketing</a> and <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~my.copyblogger.com/basic/content-that-works-ebook/" target="_blank">A Content Marketing Strategy that Works</a>. Together, they&#8217;ll help you figure out what kinds of content are needed for different functions. In fact, we have an entire free marketing library for you, which will come in handy as you&#8217;re doing a project like this one.)</p><p>You&#8217;ll also want to know what your most important topics are. <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/keyword-research/" target="_blank">Keyword research</a> matters here &#8212; primarily to find the exact language that your audience uses when they think about the problems that you solve.</p><p>And you&#8217;ll want to understand the basics of SEO copywriting as it works today. You guessed it, we have a free ebook to help you out there as well: <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/seo-copywriting/" target="_blank">How to Create Compelling Content that Ranks Well in Search Engines</a>.</p><h3>Mechanics</h3><p>The best tool for this is our friend, the spreadsheet. (The one in Google Docs works well if you&#8217;re going to be sharing the workload with other people.)</p><p>You&#8217;ll want columns for date, headline, full post URL, SEO optimization if you like, and &#8220;Action Required.&#8221; You may want to also include columns for your most important content topics, and for content types (audience attraction content, persuasive content, relationship-building content, etc.).</p><p>If you haven&#8217;t already, you&#8217;ll probably want to set up blog categories for your key topics.</p><p>And finally, add anything you particularly want to improve on your site. You might wish you had better headlines, or a stronger writing voice, or more compelling post images. It&#8217;s <em>your</em> site, so you get to decide what matters most to you.</p><h3>Get started</h3><p>Now you&#8217;re ready to work your way through your content, piece by piece. Enter the headline, the page URL, and the publication date in your spreadsheet, and look for the following:</p><ul><li>Does the post fit into your content strategy? Where does it fit into the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/customer-experience-maps/" target="_blank">audience experience</a> that you&#8217;re trying to create? Is it on point for one (or more) of your important site topics? Has it been given a category?</li><li>Have you done anything awkward to try to &#8220;optimize&#8221; this content for search, like stuffing it with keywords? If so, flag it as &#8220;Action Required&#8221; and schedule time to undo the damage. <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~scribecontent.com/" target="_blank">Scribe</a> or your Rainmaker Platform SEO tools will help you make sure your post isn&#8217;t &#8220;over-optimized,&#8221; as well as help with the other elements that make sure your SEO is in great shape.</li><li>Do you have rights to the image that you use? Are you sure?</li><li>How does the headline look? Does it offer a benefit to the audience? Is it boring? Take a look at our <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~my.copyblogger.com/basic/how-to-write-magnetic-headlines/" target="_blank">Magnetic Headlines ebook</a> if you think you might need some help on this one.</li><li>How does the first paragraph read? Does it grab the reader&#8217;s attention?</li><li>How does the whole post read? Anything awkward that could be rewritten? Outdated information to correct? Typos to fix? Fluff or jargon that could be cut?</li><li>Any dead links to correct or remove?</li><li>Can you add links to your cornerstone content? For example, if you wrote a terrific post a year later on &#8220;Blue Widgets,&#8221; and you use the phrase <em>blue widgets</em> in this post, go ahead and add a link to the great later article.</li><li>Check the formatting. Can you add more line breaks? More subheads? <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/scannable-content/" target="_blank">Reader-friendly formatting</a> is a quick way to make the content more readable without &#8220;dumbing it down&#8221; in any way.</li><li>Is this piece of content particularly strong? Should it be compiled with other great posts onto a <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/cornerstone-pages/" target="_blank">content landing page</a>? Should you link to it more frequently in your other content? Could you create a podcast on some of its ideas? Would it make a good infographic or SlideShare? Mark it &#8220;Action Required&#8221; with a note on how you might repurpose it.</li><li>If for any reason you don&#8217;t want the post on your site anymore, redirect it to another page. Never delete a post that has any links to it.</li><li>What&#8217;s the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/copywriting-tip/" target="_blank">call to action</a> on this page? Is it extremely clear? Is it currently relevant to your audience <em>and</em> your business?</li></ul><p>Repeat this process for all of the written content on your site. You won&#8217;t go back and edit video or audio content, but you can edit the pages they&#8217;re housed on. You may want to schedule updates for key multimedia content if an idea is worth revisiting.</p><p>You&#8217;ll also want to go through this process for your <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/landing-pages/" target="_blank">landing pages</a> &#8212; sales pages, your email opt-in page, and so forth. Look at them with a fresh eye and apply your latest marketing knowledge to them &#8212; since, as a Copyblogger reader, you&#8217;re always learning, after all. <img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /></p><p>You may want to bring a <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/certified-content-marketers/" target="_blank">professional copywriter</a> in for some of these key pages if you don&#8217;t feel comfortable tackling them yourself.</p><h3>As you move forward</h3><p>A content audit will help you understand your site much more deeply &#8212; but that&#8217;s not the primary reason to do it. The <em>main</em> reason is to fix any issues and make the site much more audience-friendly (and supportive of your business goals).</p><p>Once the audit is completed, look through the &#8220;Action Required&#8221; items on your spreadsheet. Start scheduling them. If you&#8217;re low on a particular topic that&#8217;s important to your audience, schedule some posts on that topic in your content calendar right now.</p><p>At the end of this process, you&#8217;ll have a site that&#8217;s fresh, that&#8217;s up-to-date, that&#8217;s aligned with your content strategy, and that doesn&#8217;t have embarrassing problems like outdated information or dead links.</p><p>You&#8217;ll also have a mental template (you could even turn it into a checklist) for new content you create. You can hand that checklist to any new or guest writers, to let them know what matters to you.</p><h3>Why you want to do all this in the first place</h3><p>I know, right about now, you&#8217;re probably thinking that this sounds like a lot of work. Which, depending on the size of your site, it will be.</p><p>So why do it?</p><p>Because for content marketing to work, the content has to be in great shape. Which means it has to serve an audience incredibly well.</p><blockquote><p>Google doesn&#8217;t want to make websites popular, they want to rank popular websites. If you don&#8217;t understand the difference, you&#8217;re in for one hell of an uphill climb. ~ <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~sugarrae.com/rants-in-bitchland/google-propaganda-marketers-wake-up/" target="_blank">&#8220;Sugar&#8221; Rae Hoffman</a></p></blockquote><p>A content audit that focuses on quality and audience experience produces the kind of site that Google wants to rank well &#8212; because it&#8217;s the kind of site that your audience wants to watch, listen to, and read.</p><div class="gray-box now-do-this"><div class="inner"></p><h3>Doing your own content audit?

That&#8217;s because an Authority Rainmaker sponsorship allows us to help you build your business.</p><p><span id="more-46183"></span>How? By helping you get your brand and message in front of people who are showing with their actions that they are passionate about marketing and committed to investing in the success of their businesses.</p><p>Let&#8217;s start with the basics &#8230;</p><h3>What is Authority Rainmaker?</h3><p>Authority Rainmaker is our second annual live event, designed to be a complete content marketing training and networking experience. It will be held May 13–15 in Denver, Colorado at the prestigious Ellie Caulkins Opera House.</p><p>Our goal for the event is simple: give attendees the tools they need to deliver real-world content marketing results. </p><p>To that end we are flying in some of the most respected speakers <em>in the world</em> on the topics of content and digital marketing (including Daniel Pink, Sally Hogshead, Chris Brogan, Ann Handley, Danny Sullivan, Henry Rollins, and more).</p><p>We are currently accepting a limited number of event sponsorship requests, and we would love for you to be a big part of this year&#8217;s event. </p><p>Now to answer the big question: <strong>what&#8217;s in it for you?</strong></p><h3>Who will attend Authority Rainmaker 2015?</h3><p>Last year&#8217;s event sold out three months in advance. This year we expect to do the same, but with more than double the number of attendees. </p><p>Authority Rainmaker will bring 1,000 content marketing professionals from around the world to Denver, including entrepreneurs, senior-level managers, technology executives, digital strategists, content creators, developers, media, and venture investors.</p><p>More than 10 countries were represented in attendance at our 2014 event, and even more engaged with attendees through social media. During the show, 2,032 Twitter users sent out 3,170 tweets that reached 4,896,760 users in total. </p><p>With more attendees this year, you can expect your reach to be even more powerful.</p><h3>Why sponsor Authority Rainmaker 2015?</h3><p>There are three primary reasons why sponsoring Authority Rainmaker will deliver big benefits for your company:</p><p><strong>1. Engagement</strong> </p><p>You will make one-on-one connections with individuals in your target market that will continue long after the event.</p><p><strong>2. Brand awareness with influencers and decision-makers</strong> </p><p>You will be able to showcase your brand at one of the most talked-about events in the industry, which will enable you to build recognition for your products or services and earn the ability to highlight your value to a relevant and responsive audience.</p><p><strong>3. Validation</strong> </p><p>You will benefit from the ability to associate your brand with Copyblogger Media. </p><p>What does this mean? Well, we have an attentive, loyal audience of more than 500,000 individuals who trust us to deliver world-class content marketing education and software. If we vet your company and approve your sponsorship, our audience will know they can trust you and that you are worthy of attention. </p><p>We&#8217;ve worked hard over almost a decade to build that level of trust, which is a form of social currency that cannot be quantified.</p><p>It can, however, be leveraged &#8212; by becoming a sponsor for Authority Rainmaker 2015.</p><p>The following sponsorship opportunities are still available:</p><ul><li>Legend Sponsorship</li><li>Hero Sponsorship</li><li>Champion Sponsorship</li><li>A La Carte Party Sponsorship</li><li>Sidekick Sponsorship</li><li>Media Sponsorship</li></ul><p><strong>For specific details on each package, and to contact us regarding available sponsorship opportunities, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~my.copyblogger.com/authority-rainmaker/sponsorship/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</strong></p><div class="author-box"><div><img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3d7656cc402ab5e8a5bf78c67b5d0388?s=100&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D100&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-100 photo' height='100' width='100' /> <span class="subheading">About the author</span><h3>Jessica Commins</h3><br><p>Jessica Commins is Copyblogger Media's Executive VP of Operations.

Content. Growth hacking. Pivot. Engagement. A few words and phrases that make us want to stick a fork in our eye each time we hear them. Or stick a fork in the eye of the person using the words.</p><p>We all hate buzzwords, but it&#8217;s hard to get away from them. A phrase sticks and soon a parade that rivals Macy&#8217;s is trailing behind it. That popularity begets even more popularity, and, well after the phrase has worn out its original meaning, everyone is using the damn word.</p><p>Thing is: behind each buzzword is a meaningful truth. And quite possibly, a trend worth joining. For instance, anyone who jumped on the big data or <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/content-marketing/" target="_blank">content</a> bandwagon did not miss out. In fact, they were rewarded.</p><p>And I&#8217;m going to make a similar statement about the buzzword for 2015: <em>adaptive content</em>. Pay attention.<span id="more-46359"></span></p><h3>Adaptive content 101</h3><p>Some of you might recall the phrase &#8220;adaptive content&#8221; from the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/lede-adaptive-content/" target="_blank">last episode of The Lede podcast</a>. And some of you might recall the difficulty we had defining the phrase. The definitions we shared span a spectrum of ideas.</p><p>Garrett Moon from CoSchedule described <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~todaymade.com/blog/adaptive-content/" target="_blank">adaptive content</a> as the idea of creating once, then publishing everywhere, which was at one time NPR&#8217;s official content policy (see <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.programmableweb.com/news/cope-create-once-publish-everywhere/2009/10/13" target="_blank">COPE</a>).</p><p>This is a concept we use here at Copyblogger, and we&#8217;ve talked about this before with the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/asset-pillar-infographic/" target="_blank">asset pillar</a>, especially with infographics. That definition is useful, but it&#8217;s just a start.</p><p>Dig further into the research (what little of it there is) and you&#8217;ll probably think to yourself: &#8220;This is nothing more than sophisticated personalization.&#8221; You know, the email newsletter you get every day that begins, &#8220;Dear [your first name]&#8221; or Amazon’s recommendation engine.</p><p>While this is true about adaptive content, these examples are all rule-based. We tell our machines, &#8220;Okay, if he does X followed by Y, then we think he&#8217;ll appreciate Z.&#8221; Marketers and search engines both want to guess the user intent.</p><p>Very primitive. Very clunky. We should be able to do better.</p><p>Our hope with adaptive content is to tailor content to a customer&#8217;s experience, behavior, and desires. Like a custom-built mold.</p><p>In essence, adaptive content is a culmination of everything we&#8217;ve been talking about &#8212; <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/customer-experience-maps/" target="_blank">experience maps</a>, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/master-storytelling/" target="_blank">storyboarding</a>, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/empathy-maps/" target="_blank">empathy maps</a> &#8212; and what we&#8217;ve been saying for so long about creating an experience.</p><p>Adaptive content merges all these disciplines under one roof.</p><h3>It&#8217;s almost like choosing your own adventure</h3><p>I&#8217;ve got two examples for you. Let&#8217;s start with a simple one.</p><p>Mars Cyrillo, product and marketing VP at CI&amp;T, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140526133822-762619-predictive-analytics-and-adaptive-content-the-new-digital-marketing-transformation" target="_blank">pointed to the experience of buying an airline ticket</a>. Normally we&#8217;ll go directly to the airline&#8217;s website, find the best flight, and then go to Expedia to buy the ticket.</p><p>Instead, Mars explains, adaptive content would be American Airlines recognizing that people behave this way, and then delivering an incentive or specific content that would keep visitors on their site.</p><p>This could be as routine as a pop-up offering car rentals or hotel rooms at a reduced rate exclusive to the American Airlines website. It just depends on how much American Airlines knows about its customers.</p><p>Noz Urbina wrote about another great example on Content Marketing Institute. He describes a <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~contentmarketinginstitute.com/2014/09/adaptive-content-omni-channel-technique/" target="_blank">wine-tasting adventure with his partner</a> where the winery provided tablets at the table during the event, but that was it.</p><p>Fun, but pointless.</p><p>For starters, Noz said they could have:</p><ul><li>Allowed check-ins by social media (which should&#8217;ve been a no-brainer).</li><li>Displayed a personalized welcome screen.</li><li>Suggested wine lists and accompaniments like cheeses or crackers.</li><li>Adapted the micro-copy and tone of the website based on his visit.</li></ul><p>But the winery missed the mark, especially this mind-blowing opportunity:</p><blockquote><p>What they should have done was display a personal welcome screen on the tablet that they gave, and allowed people to add items to the shopping cart that would then add to their final bill so that when they went to the cash register, they paid for what they drank there.</p></blockquote><p>That would&#8217;ve been adaptive content in action.</p><p>And the reason this is so important: We all come to expect this kind of service (just like Noz did). Whether it&#8217;s at the gas pump, the golf course, massage parlor, movie theater, or in our living rooms and offices, we all believe that our experiences should be more interactive.</p><p>Why? Smartphones.</p><h3>Some seductive stats</h3><p>This overly attached love affair with smartphones has been building all along &#8212; and is not going away any time soon. Witness:</p><ol><li>About 13 percent of Internet traffic comes from global mobile users. In 2009, that number was just one percent. What contributed to this rise in mobile use? <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2012/12/04/5-eye-opening-stats-that-show-the-world-is-going-mobile/" target="_blank">Shopping</a>.</li><li><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gstatic.com%2Fads%2Fresearch%2Fen%2F2011_TheMobileMovement.pdf" target="_blank">Seventy-seven percent of mobile users</a> use search engines and social sites on their phones.</li><li>According to a <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~googlemobileads.blogspot.com/2011/04/smartphone-user-study-shows-mobile.html" target="_blank">Google Smartphone User study</a>, &#8220;88 percent of those who look for local information on their smartphones take action within a day.&#8221; Read: smartphone users are highly-motived buyers.</li><li>More importantly, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~googlemobileads.blogspot.com/2011/04/smartphone-user-study-shows-mobile.html" target="_blank">nine out of 10 searches on a mobile device end in an action</a>: reservation, purchase, appointment, download.</li><li>Commerce success begins with a superb mobile experience. A <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~visual.ly/mobile-web-disappointing-mobile-users" target="_blank">Compuware study</a> suggested that if you deliver a bad mobile experience, then more than half of those users will not recommend you &#8212; and probably recommend the competition instead.</li><li>According to Google search data, one-third of all CPG (consumer packaged goods) searches now originate from smartphones. This trend will only continue to rise since, as Google wrote in a 2011 paper called <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/zmot-why-it-matters-now-more-than-ever.html" target="_blank">Zero Moment of Truth</a>, &#8220;Search is always accessible &#8212; from anywhere, on any device and at any given time.&#8221;</li><li>Deloitte Consulting confirmed the power of smartphones over commerce in a 2013 paper that demonstrated the devices influenced <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.fitch.com/think-article/the-use-of-smartphones-in-store/" target="_blank">$159 billion of U.S. retail sales in 2012</a>.</li><li>But what it comes down to is the merging of the offline and online world as <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/digitizing_the_consumer_decision_journey" target="_blank">McKinsey stated</a>: &#8220;According to published reports, 48 percent of U.S. consumers believe companies need to do a better job of integrating their online and offline experiences.&#8221;</li><li>Fifty-four percent of U.S. consumers want <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.luxurydaily.com/54pc-of-u-s-consumers-crave-in-store-digital-mobile-touch-points-cisco/" target="_blank">in-store digital, mobile touch points</a>.</li><li>Often the buying phase starts long before the purchase. <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/research-studies/the-zero-moment-of-truth-macro-study.html" target="_blank">Eighty-eight percent of consumers research</a> (and these days, the research could start on a mobile phone, laptop, tablet, watch, or pair of glasses) before they buy, consulting an average of 10.4 sources.</li><li>Online research efforts often involve visiting online reviews, ratings, and recommendations, which according to Prestige Marketing leads to <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.prestigemarketing.ca/blog/online-marketing-in-2012-what-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank">105 percent higher</a> conversion rates. Are you taking advantage of ratings and reviews?</li><li>Showrooming &#8212; when consumers use their phones to comparison shop in stores &#8212; is no longer a threat to brick-and-mortars and <em>reverse showrooming</em> &#8212; when consumers go online to research products but then head to brick-and-mortar stores to complete their purchases &#8212; is actually on the rise</a> (<a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.businessinsider.com/reverse-showrooming-bricks-and-mortar-retailers-fight-back-2-2014-2" target="_blank">69 percent</a>), creating an opportunity for forward-thinking businesses to capture more sales.</li></ol><p>In other words, smartphones rule the commerce roost. In addition, opportunities for creating personalized experiences through adaptive content are abound, as these further studies suggest:</p><ol start="13"><li><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.marketingweek.co.uk/trends/latest-trends/the-marketing-trends-for-2014-part-one/4008889.article" target="_blank">56 percent of U.S. consumers</a> are happy to buy from a retailer that offers a good (not even great, mind you) personalized experience. (Registration required to view study.)</li><li>In this 2012 <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.consumersearch.com/archive/2012" target="_blank">Consumer Search</a> report, 65 percent of respondents said they look to friends, family, and social media for gift-giving ideas. Interestingly enough, 64 percent also said they look to companies to provide that sort of inspiration.</li><li>Companies seem to recognize this desire because <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://econsultancy.com/blog/62583-94-of-businesses-say-personalisation-is-critical-to-their-success" target="_blank">94 percent of them say personalization is critical to their success</a>.</li><li>And it&#8217;s been long known that personalized e-commerce sites can <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~searchenginewatch.com/sew/news/2048512/personalized-commerce-sites-can-increase-conversions" target="_blank">increase conversions by 70 percent</a>.</li></ol><p>So the question is: Are you inspiring your customers with this type of personalized experience?</p><h3>The challenges that lie ahead</h3><p>Let me highlight some keywords from this data dump: search, website, mobile, personalization, and engagement. These are the key concepts behind adaptive content, which leads me to think the new environment we are in is less about <em>content</em> and more about <em>experience</em>.</p><p>As Jerod said in our conversation on The Lede, &#8220;It serves up almost a customized experience for them that is different from what another person gets. Each experience is individualized to have maximum impact.&#8221;</p><p>Of course, experience is built on content.</p><p>But adaptive content presents at least two challenges for a marketer: </p><ol><li>Implementing the technology.</li><li>Creating the content.</li></ol><p>The technology is not easy to figure out and will vary depending on each business&#8217;s individual needs. That disadvantage, though, is the perfect opportunity for companies to say, &#8220;How can we make software solutions to make adaptive content easier?&#8221;</p><p>The other challenge is finding the resources to create the content. If you have six customer avatars, then you have six different paths, and each of those paths break off two, three, or four different times. You&#8217;ve got a lot of content to create.</p><p>No problem if there were 48 hours in a day.</p><p>So, with those challenges and some unanswered questions before us, in 2015 we will be diving into the deep end of the adaptive content pool. Our hope is to provide answers and solutions for these challenges so we can all be on the right side of cutting-edge marketing and emerging technology.</p><p>Welcome to 2015, and stay tuned.</p><h3>Adaptive content in action</h3><p>Have you seen businesses successfully employ adaptive content?</p><p>Or have you observed missed opportunities for businesses to use adaptive content? What could the companies have done differently?</p><p>How can adaptive content help <em>your business</em> create a superior customer experience?</p><p><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Year-Adaptive-Content-is-Here-8117878.S.5957885750266646531?" target="_blank">Let&#8217;s continue the discussion</a> over on LinkedIn &#8230;</p><p><em><small>Image by <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://unsplash.com/ugmonk target="_blank">Jeff Sheldon</a> via Unsplash.</small></em></p><div class="author-box"><div><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/81c83444aed195de41d9e227bf13c2dc?s=100&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D100&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-100 photo' height='100' width='100' /> <span class="subheading">About the author</span><h3>Demian Farnworth</h3><br><p>Demian Farnworth is Copyblogger Media's Chief Copywriter.

Live in fragments no longer. ~ E.M. Forster, <em>Howards End</em></p></blockquote><p>The thing, I think, that keeps people from building successful businesses, especially online, is that business seems complicated.</p><p>And it is, in the sense of having a lot of moving parts. (Which, of course, is why we work so hard to build <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com/" target="_blank">tools that make the technical part easy</a>.) </p><p>Like anything worth doing &#8212; raising a family, building a house, growing a garden &#8212; there are a lot of small things you need to figure out how to do correctly.</p><p>But arching over all of these is the Big Thing &#8212; and if you get it right, the details will tend to work themselves out.</p><p><span id="more-44767"></span>It is my strong belief that we are on this planet to help one another. And that business is a way to do that on a greater scale.</p><h3>To help each other, we have to connect</h3><p>I first got online in 1989, when &#8220;social media&#8221; was called <em>virtual community</em>, for those who had a name for it at all.</p><p>Of course we knew that it would change the world, because it had changed <em>our</em> world so much. And yet, it didn&#8217;t change as much as we imagined it would. </p><p>(In case you&#8217;re curious, online community looked pretty much exactly like it does today; the connection platforms are just easier to use now. Spam and scandal, connection and conflict all looked remarkably like they do in 2015. Human nature is a stubbornly consistent thing.) </p><p>There were always a few mysterious denizens in any community who remained purely &#8220;virtual&#8221; to us. Some had dark secrets &#8212; <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog" target="_blank">on the Internet, nobody knows you&#8217;re a dog</a>, in the words of the 1993 <em>New Yorker</em> cartoon.</p><p>And you only had to come across a couple of dogs before you learned to pair online communication with old-fashioned offline connection. To go &#8220;F2F&#8221; as we said back in the olden days.</p><p>Here we are, on the cusp of 2015, and things haven&#8217;t changed so very much. </p><h3>The age of miracle and wonder</h3><p>The Internet allows us to connect in ways that are remarkable and new. We can form friendships with anyone on the planet. We can share our message with thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions &#8212; at virtually no incremental cost. We can even watch an astronaut play a favorite tune &#8230; from space. (And talk with him on Facebook or Twitter about it.)</p><p>And the more amazing the technology gets, the more it brings us right back around to who we fundamentally are.</p><p>I like <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~righteousmind.com/" target="_blank">Jonathan Haidt&#8217;s</a> definition of our nature &#8212; 90 percent ape and 10 percent bee. We are a social creature. (Even confirmed introverts, like <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/its-all-my-fault/" target="_blank">Brian</a> and me.) And it is our deepest nature to connect and to work together.</p><p>What made our 2014 Authority conference such a profound experience for all of us at Copyblogger? (<a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/best-of-2014/" target="_blank">Jerod put it nicely in yesterday&#8217;s post.</a>)</p><p>It was the sitting together in the halls, throwing around ideas, musing on business problems, joking and brainstorming and engaging. Or even forgetting all about business for a few hours to dance in a nearby club.</p><p>You can ask anyone who was there: The energy of connection was palpable.  </p><p>It was meeting lovely, fascinating people like <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~intertwinemarketing.com/about/" target="_blank">Darren D.</a> and <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://mytrybusiness.com/about/" target="_blank">Sonia T</a>. </p><p>Making face-to-face connections with longtime &#8220;virtual&#8221; friends like <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/author/henneke/" target="_blank">Henneke</a> and <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/author/sean/" target="_blank">Sean</a>. </p><p>Introducing <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~sethgodin.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Seth</a> to <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.andreavahl.com/grandmas-corner" target="_blank">Grandma</a>.</p><p>Catching up with loved friends who live in faraway lands, like <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.problogger.net/archives/author/darren/" target="_blank">Darren</a>. </p><p>Why have we talked so much about this year&#8217;s upcoming Authority Rainmaker conference? Because we crave more experiences like that &#8212; exhilarating, exhausting, deeply satisfying. </p><p>Just like we did last year (but on a larger scale), we&#8217;ve organized the event around profoundly useful content, yes &#8212; but also with all kinds of social spaces for connection and conversation. (This year we&#8217;ve scored the very beautiful Ellie Caulkins Opera House in Denver, which has not only a superb theater space but also spacious, welcoming areas for conversation away from the main stage.) </p><p>We&#8217;ll organize a rock-solid program of sessions, which will make you <em>hate</em> to miss any of them.</p><p>And then we&#8217;ll tempt you to miss some of them.</p><p>To venture out into the wide hallways, grab a drink and a snack, meet up with someone you&#8217;ve only known online until now. Reconnect with old friends.
