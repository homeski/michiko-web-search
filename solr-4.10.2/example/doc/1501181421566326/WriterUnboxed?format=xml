<p>Let&#8217;s talk literary awards. Specifically, your tragic lack thereof. It happens. Vonnegut never won a Nebula. Nabokov got snubbed so many times he had to create the PEN/Nabokov Award so he wouldn’t feel like a failure. If these greats can&#8217;t win, what hope do you have? Wait, that came out wrong. I meant to say, here&#8217;s how you can succeed where they failed. I&#8217;ll guide you through the complete awards process, from campaigning your way onto the ballot to gauging how lit up you can get at the awards show after-party.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Getting on the Ballot</h3>
<div class="simplePullQuote"><p>Your next move, obviously, is to look at all your peers who <em>didn&#8217;t</em> make it onto the ballot and indulge in what the Germans call <em>schadenfreude</em> (pronounced SHAY-den-frood).</p>
</div>
<p>You’ve got some award-eligible work, but you don’t want to look like a greedy, self-promoting shill. I get that. Let&#8217;s start by looking at some classy ways to get your name out there.</p>
<p>First, <a title="Start Your Author Blog in Five Easy Steps" href="http://writerunboxed.com/2013/09/21/start-your-author-blog-in-five-easy-steps/" target="_blank">write a thing on your blog</a> listing what you have eligible. For instance:</p>
<blockquote><p>My name is Joe Schmo, and my short story, “The Nine Dead Grandmothers of Vincent LeRoy,” is eligible for—and fated to win—the Super Fancy Award for Best Short Story. Please send my prize to [insert PO Box number]. If shipping costs are prohibitive, I will accept the cash value of the award statuette.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some writers like <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2015/01/05/sff-authorseditorsartistsfan-creators-2015-award-awareness-post/" target="_blank">John Scalzi</a> and Charlie Stross have dedicated spaces for listing your award-eligible work. Remember, the writing community likes to help its own, so go ahead and do this at every writing website you can find. If they don’t have a thread specifically set up for this, simply use whichever of their posts has the highest Google search rank.</p>
<p>Back to your own blog, you can generate good will by magnanimously highlighting other people&#8217;s work. Don&#8217;t be afraid to go outside the mainstream, either. If you&#8217;re looking for names, here&#8217;s one: me, Bill Ferris, the guy who went to all this trouble to write this helpful article. Stop making that face, it&#8217;s a swell idea. Advocate for some new, edgy authors, too. People will think you&#8217;ve got your finger on the pulse of innovative lit, and you&#8217;ll be doing yourself a favor by talking up a bunch of patsies who stand no chance of finishing ahead of you.<span id="more-35285"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_35288" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dclmeyer/14806941410/in/photolist-613vCZ-kfXdUA-avDz7m-kfVnMZ-62B96c-98s8JX-7dGo3Z-kfUGbr-9c22yz-oyrrPh-fNWKaL-83zr3z-nSzuTm-72GN2r-p4M35f-b9qCt4-x5qFt-67gRED-ndsXBY-kfVo38-kG5WS-9ddnTs-7dHv8a-6Yj4w6-oHXiHS-98vh2b-hTrNrQ-8jezZV-611Ljr-hTrnRM-gyd1Zp-8g2Gxt-bhvq6V-67gTzc-ahh5v5-9c29Wa-asxcAh-kMsmZr-9Z1qZW-72N5Bp-JvCya-fuYepj-omSWp6-aLwJSr-fNWJEL-fhpVJo-baDbgp-9xECun-gnAUQj-jAEGrv"><img class="size-medium wp-image-35288" src="http://writerunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/trophy_shop-300x226.jpg" alt="trophy shop" width="300" height="226" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo by akahawkeyefan</p></div>
<h3>Step 2: Get out the Vote</h3>
<p>Congratulations! You&#8217;ve made it onto the ballot! That&#8217;s quite an accomplishment by itself! These are the things you need to say publicly to lull your opponents into a false sense of security.</p>
<p>Your next move, obviously, is to look at all your peers who <em>didn&#8217;t</em> make it onto the ballot and indulge in what the Germans call <em>schadenfreude</em> (pronounced SHAY-den-frood). Make a list of people in whose faces you want to shove your good fortune. People may tell you this is childish and petty. You can tell them there&#8217;s plenty of room for more names on the list.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote"><p>President Jackson, President Grant, and President Franklin can be pretty persuasive. It’s not a bribe, it’s <em>paid commercial time</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>Meanwhile, you&#8217;ll be out there stumping for your work by going to conventions, pounding the pavement, working the room, pressing the flesh, kissing the babies, buying the drinks, and generally showing what a great person you are. And oh by the way, I could really use your vote in the upcoming&#8211;oh, you&#8217;re not a voting member? Oh, I see. Yeah, well, I think I&#8217;ve got a panel to go to. Enjoy that small-batch microbrew I bought you. Man, can you believe they charge that much for a beer? No, no, it was my pleasure. Really. It&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>As the voting deadline approaches, consider asking other writers if you can write a guest post on their blog, or if they&#8217;d like to write a glowing puff piece about you. Most writers would shoot their own mothers in the face for even a scrap of recognition, so they&#8217;ll be thrilled to have a big-shot like you grace their backwater website. If they refuse, no hard feelings, they can&#8217;t help being dumb. But don&#8217;t give up too easily&#8211;remember that President Jackson, President Grant, and President Franklin can be pretty persuasive. It’s not a bribe, it’s <em>paid commercial time</em>. Perfectly ethical, kinda.</p>
<h3>Step 3: The Moment of Truth</h3>
<p>For the awards ceremony, acquire the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fancy duds</li>
<li>Liquors, hard and soft</li>
<li>A teeth grinding guard</li>
</ul>
<p>Time to prepare your acceptance speech. Get your list of people to thank: Your agent, spouse, editor, writing group, friends, kids, mistress, landlord, the guy whose money you stole to buy your new laptop, your cats, your boss for not firing you for writing your book on the clock. Then, write your concession speech. Be gracious, and be thorough. When the winner is talking, it&#8217;s your turn to read yours so everyone can see how gracious you are in defeat. Yes, this goes against protocol, but they can&#8217;t do anything to you when you&#8217;ve quite literally got nothing left to lose.</p>
<p>After that, there&#8217;s nothing to do but drown your sorrows at the after-parties. Don&#8217;t read much into it if you don&#8217;t get an invitation or nobody will meet your gaze or if they give you phony directions to the shindig.</p>
<p>And if by chance you do win, just remember what got you there: hard work, a good editor, and this article, which you are now legally bound to mention in your acceptance speech.</p>
<p><strong>Are you eligible to win anything this year? What&#8217;s <em>your</em> plan to become an award-winning literary darling? Let us know in the comments!</strong></p>

<h3>Shot Out of a Cannon</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m told that there are people who find the holidays restful. I have yet to meet one of these extraordinary creatures, but I think they would find holding the publishing industry&#8217;s first grand-slam conference of the year in the second week of January to be a dandy thing. Bright-tailed and bushy-eyed, they&#8217;d dash out, we must assume, tinsel still in-hair, ready to take on the rigors of Digital Book World&#8217;s (DBW) day-and-night glad-handing and info-processing with &#8220;Happy New Year!&#8221; energy.</p>
<p>Those of us who find the holidays something less than restful are cheering the news that <a href="http://digitalbookworldconference.com/" target="_blank">Digital Book World next year moves to March 7 to 9</a>.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote"><p>What do we expect in return for heavy investment in our work? What do we expect a publisher to invest?</p>
</div>
<p>For now, the sixth annual doing of <a href="https://www.eiseverywhere.com/ehome/90839/digitalbookworldconference2015/" target="_blank">Digital Book World </a>in New York City &#8212; the 2015 edition &#8212; has just closed, with Sixth Avenue&#8217;s face-freezing winds to slap us out of The Most Wonderful Time of the Year.</p>
<p>Expertly mounted and run like clockwork at the Hilton Midtown by David Nussbaum&#8217;s F+W Media staff &#8212; led by David Blansfield, Gary Lynch, Beth Dean, Taylor Jacobs Sferra &#8212; Digital Book World drew more than 1,200 attendees this year, plus a lot of industry folks who needed to <em>meet</em> those attendees. I can&#8217;t remember a conference with so many requests for private chats with start-up personnel and key services outfits. Many of them &#8220;surround the conference,&#8221; as one observer put it, meeting harried attendees for coffee and a deal on West 53rd, 54th, 56th. We gave nearby cafes, restaurants, and lounges a lot of business, in other words.</p>
<p>Mike Shatzkin once again programmed the event, somehow achieving 12 keynote events, a DBW record, I believe, including an impressive conversation with Amazon&#8217;s Russ Grandinetti and a rare sighting of an Apple exec, the iBooks chief Keith Moerer.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote"><p>Is it possible that we assign a causal effect — “the more I invest, the more I’ll get back” — to this kind of work, more as a common way of thinking than as an accurate view of market conditions?</p>
</div>
<p><a href="http://epilogger.com/events/digital-book-world-2015" target="_blank">#DBW15</a> to its Twitter friends is an industry conference, not a writers&#8217; conference. That distinction may not be the one everyone would prefer, but the event &#8212; focused on business movements, trends, and perspectives &#8212; throws off all kinds of energies and implications for writers, of course.</p>
<p>One annual element that directly involves writerly talent is the delivery of the Digital Book World author survey. This year it has a small novella of a title: <a href="http://store.digitalbookworld.com/the-author-publisher-relationship-in-a-changing-market-download" target="_blank">Authors Facing the Industry: Data and Insights from Authors on the Publishing Business, Author-Publisher Relations, and Marketing</a>. It&#8217;s for sale, as you can see, but I&#8217;ve talked with DBW editorial director Rich Bellis, and he&#8217;s going to be making available some insight articles about its details soon, from the survey&#8217;s author, the sociologist Dana Beth Weinberg.</p>
<p>My close colleague and WU icon Jane Friedman &#8212; also known as Porter&#8217;s Brain &#8212; was with us this year at DBW, looking good in her cannon helmet and ably moderating a panel discussion that was prompted by the new survey.</p>
<p><span id="more-35266"></span></p>
<h3>Can We Survey Our Own Expectations?</h3>
<div id="attachment_7447" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://porteranderson.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Porter-Provocations-in-Publishing-logo-header-WU-001.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7447" src="http://porteranderson.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Porter-Provocations-in-Publishing-logo-header-WU-001-300x227.jpg" alt="Provocations image by Liam Walsh" width="300" height="227" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Provocations image by Liam Walsh</p></div>
<p>I had been provided with a copy of the executive summary in advance and I&#8217;ve written up some of the key points of what turns out this year to be a very thoughtful bit of work.</p>
<p>You can read that piece here at <em>The Bookseller&#8217;s</em> The FutureBook: <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/futurebook/today-dbw15-surveys-authors-risks-rewards-commitment" target="_blank">Digital Book World surveys authors &#8212; &#8216;Risks, Rewards, Commitment</a>.&#8217; If you&#8217;re not familiar with it, The FutureBook is our no-paywall, read-it-free digital-publishing-community site. You&#8217;re always most welcome to join us there.</p>
<p>The DBW survey is voluntary, meaning that the 2,545 authors who answered its questions were responding to a call for input, not selected in a controlled sample.</p>
<p>The report that Weinberg has produced puts its attention on the 1,879 published authors included in that survey universe.</p>
<p>To quickly recap here some of the more interesting components of that group, and quoting from Weinberg&#8217;s commentary:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than half of this author sample group has only indie-published (55.8%, n=1,049).</li>
<li>13.0% have only traditionally published (n=245).</li>
<li>Close to a third (31.1%, n=585) have done both.</li>
<li>The sample includes a mix of both experienced and relatively new authors as well as a mix of prolific and less accomplished authors.</li>
<li>Compared to the other two types of authors, the hybrid authors in the sample tend to be older and to have had longer and more prolific careers.</li>
<li>The vast majority of authors in this study reported that their latest book was fiction, with romance representing the most popular category both for traditional and for indie publications. Thus, the results of this report will be most applicable to genre fiction publishing.</li>
<li>The “average” respondent to the survey (based on median results) is a college-educated woman in her mid- to late-forties who indie-publishes genre fiction, most likely romance, has published three books and began publishing in 2011.</li>
<li>In all, a total of 830 respondents provided information on their most recent traditional publishing experiences, and 1,634 respondents provided information on their most recent indie-publishing experiences.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_35271" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://writerunboxed.com/?attachment_id=35271" rel="attachment wp-att-35271"><img class="wp-image-35271" src="http://writerunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Graphic-from-DBW-survey-2015-525x255.jpg" alt="From Digital Book World's &quot;The Author-Publisher Relationship in a Changing Market&quot;" width="400" height="194" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">From Digital Book World&#8217;s &#8220;The Author-Publisher Relationship in a Changing Market&#8221;</p></div>
<p>And the issue I&#8217;d like to pull out for you today &#8212; your bit of Porter-provocation &#8212; is the sensible question Weinberg is able to extract from the mass of data produced by the survey: How does your investment in your work affect its performance in the marketplace?</p>
<p>This is an intelligent framework for weighing questions of traditional- and self-publishing, in that the &#8220;risks and rewards&#8221; context Weinberg is using lets you think of the main available pathways to market in light of how much they require &#8212; how much expense, in other works, in many terms: financial, time, impact on lifestyle, health, energy, outside support, internal fortitude&#8230;investment. It takes a lot.</p>
<h3>Print and Digital, Time and Money</h3>
<p>Weinberg, in her executive summary writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Within the different modes of publishing there are also differences in the level of investment on the parts of both authors and publishers.</p>
<p>For example, even when publishers absorb the bulk of risk, as in the advance-paying model, there are still wide variations in how much money a publisher may invest in any given book, starting with the amount of the advance itself.</p>
<p>Within indie publishing, there may be differences in how much the author invests in producing and distributing their books. In addition, authors who start their own companies commit to the investment of legal fees, above and beyond the costs of producing and promoting their books.</p></blockquote>
<p>In that last point, Weinberg is referring to the LLC or other incorporation that some authors use to handle the business side of their work. She&#8217;s careful to count that step as part of the expense, the investment, that a writer may make during a career tilted at the marketplace.</p>
<p>But without going into the full sweep of her study &#8212; I&#8217;m extracting only one of its points of emphasis &#8212; it&#8217;s interesting to consider this &#8220;investment&#8221; element of her findings. ROI, return on investment, is a common factor in much business calculation. But in creative work, and even in relation to selling creative work, I wonder how clear our heads are at moments we should consider any number of ROI dilemmas.</p>
<p>Weinberg:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Authors whose books are selected for print distribution tend to earn more on those books than authors whose books are not—a median of $1,000–$2,999 for digital-only and print-on-demand books and $5,000–$9,999 for books with print distribution.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>However, for advance-paying publishers in this sample, the majority of whom invested in print distribution, this factor is not as predictive of book earnings as advance amount is</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>The findings clearly suggest that the investments by publishers and indie authors in their projects directly relate to sales and earnings. Moreover, these findings suggest that the difference in expected outcomes for an author’s books correspond not only to publishing mode but also to the level of investments made in a given project.</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A hybrid author, herself, Weinberg is sensitive to expectations, which is where I think so much of this discussion is richest for authors:</p>
<p>What do we expect in return for heavy investment (of whatever type) in our work? &#8212; for our own investments? &#8212; for a publisher&#8217;s investments? &#8212; an agent&#8217;s investments? &#8212; even a family&#8217;s investments of support for a writing parent or child?</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>What would you say are your key investments in your work?</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Can you expect them, realistically, to affect the outcome of that work in the marketplace?</strong></em></li>

<h2><strong>The challenge: does this narrative <i>compel</i> you to turn the page?</strong></h2>
<p>Please judge by storytelling quality, not by genre—some reject an opening page immediately because of genre, but that’s not a good enough reason when the point is to analyze for storytelling strength.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote"></p>
<p><strong>A First-page Checklist</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It begins <em>connecting the reader with the protagonist</em></li>
<li><em>Something is happening. </em>On a first page, this does NOT include a character musing about whatever.</li>
<li><em>What happens is dramatized</em> in an immediate scene with action and description plus, if it works, dialogue.</li>
<li>What happens <em>moves the story forward</em>.</li>
<li>What happens <em>has consequences</em> for the protagonist.</li>
<li>The protagonist <em>desires something</em>.</li>
<li>The protagonist <em>does something</em>.</li>
<li><em>There’s enough of a setting</em> to orient the reader as to where things are happening.</li>
<li>It <em>happens in the NOW</em> of the story.</li>
<li><em>Backstory? What backstory?</em> We’re in the NOW of the story.</li>
<li><em>Set-up? What set-up?</em> We’re in the NOW of the story.</li>
<li>What happens <em>raises a story question</em>—what happens next? or why did that happen?</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>Turns out the number one positions on the various fiction bestseller lists were occupied by novels we’re already flogged. This novel was number three on the <em>New York Times</em> trade paperback fiction bestseller list for January 11, 2015. How strong is the opening page—would this have hooked an agent if it came in from an unpublished writer? Do you think it’s <em><strong>compelling</strong></em>? Reminder: “compelling” is much different than “interesting”—it means that you are <em>irresistibly</em> urged to turn the page by what you’ve read. Following are what would be the first 17 manuscript lines of chapter one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">LOG ENTRY: SOL 6</p>
<p>I’m pretty much fucked.</p>
<p>That’s my considered opinion.</p>
<p>Fucked.</p>
<p>Six days into what should be the greatest two months of my life, and it’s turned into a nightmare.</p>
<p>I don’t even know who’ll read this. I guess someone will find it eventually. Maybe a hundred years from now.</p>
<p>For the record… I didn’t die on Sol 6. Certainly the rest of the crew thought I did, and I can’t blame them. Maybe there’ll be a day of national mourning for me, and my Wikipedia page will say, “Mark Watney is the only human being to have died on Mars.”</p>
<p>And it’ll be right, probably. ’Cause I’ll surely die here. Just not on Sol 6 when everyone thinks I did.</p>
<p>Let’s see…where do I begin?</p>
<p>The Ares Program. Mankind reaching out to Mars to send people to another planet for the very first time and expand the horizons of humanity blah, blah, blah. The Ares 1 crew did their thing and came back heroes. They got the parades and fame and love of the world.</p></blockquote>

<p>My vote and editorial notes after the fold.<br />

<p><a href="http://writerunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Martian.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-35116" src="http://writerunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Martian.jpg" alt="Martian" width="200" height="304" /></a>Did you recognize Andy Weir and his <em>The Martian?</em> Was this opening page compelling if you picked it up to sample it in a bookstore?</p>
<p><strong>My vote: Yes</strong></p>
<p>First of all, there’s that one element other than story that can compel me to a page turn—a strong, clear voice. I like this character right from the start. He’s a regular person, like me, and I can connect with that.</p>
<p>Then the narrative creates a life-or-death situation that raises compelling story questions. What happened? What will happen next? Will he survive? I don’t think you have to be a science fiction fan to want to read more of this—am I wrong?</p>
<p>However, I do think it’s lacking in one respect. I would trade much of the last paragraph for a little scene-setting. Doesn’t have to be much, but I sure would like to be able to “see” the context of his narrative.</p>
<p>Your thoughts? Would you have turned the page?</p>

<p>I love having a plan, a detailed goal that I can accomplish based on my own timeline. When I was seven, for example, I made a list of things I wanted to purchase. 1. Olivia Newton John record 2. Red clogs 3. Beaded moccasins 4. Mrs. Grossman stickers.</p>
<p>I included the cost of each item, as well as when, based on chores and allowance and collecting out-of-town neighbors’ mail, I&#8217;d have saved the money. I got that Olivia Newton John record. The moccasins and stickers too. My parents gave me shiny red clogs for Christmas.</p>
<p>I kept up this planning into my adult years. After college, when my best friends started moving away to pursue promotions or grad school or men, I found myself happily teaching high school English. But I was lonely. Right around that time, my boyfriend, Fritz, dumped me (over the phone). Then we got back together. Then he dumped me again (over the phone). Without my besties or even a douche-canoe like Fritz, I needed a plan to combat my loneliness. So I made another list: <em>People</em> <em>I’d Like to Spend More Time With</em>. And then I set about the task of getting unlonely.</p>
<p>Along with plans and goals, I love efficiency. The day I found a chocolate chip cookie recipe where I wasn&#8217;t required to put the dry ingredients in one bowl and the wet ones in another, only to combine them? Halleluyah! Efficiency <em>and</em> one less bowl to wash!</p>
<p>I am equally efficient when I fold laundry or grocery shop or walk my kids to school. Some of this appreciation for efficiency is based on my DNA, some on my upbringing. Growing up in California where drought was common, I learned to take two-minute showers. These days, as it costs about $8 million to fill our old oil furnace, I wear a jacket to avoid turning up the heat. Why waste heat when I&#8217;m the only one home? If my husband leaves his breakfast plate on the counter, I brush off the toast crumbs and have my son use that same plate. My signature? Not <em>Sarah Reed Callender</em>, but <em>SCall</em>. I like to do things quickly, and I don’t like waste.<span id="more-35098"></span></p>
<p>It’s unfortunate, then, that I am a writer. Even writers who are Plotters can never be truly efficient. Except for Stephen King. While I am not a huge fan of scary novels, I loved everything about King’s craft book, <em><a href="http://stephenking.com/results.php?q=On+Writing">On Writing</a>. E</em>xcept for the part where he says he writes one book each season. That seemed a little braggy. With <em>my</em> WIP, I am roughly 26 months in, and I have roughly 10,810 words. That’s 34 pages. In 26 months. If you do the math, I will punch you in the throat.</p>
<p>My kids and part-time jobs decrease my writing time, but even if I wrote fiction full-time, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be a threat to Mr. One-Season. I have to accept that my love of efficiency is not transferable to my writing, that I require a significant Muddling and Experimenting phase that includes staring out the window, generating charts and lists and plot arcs, color-coding and highlighting moments of tension and climax, only to realize I have been holding the metaphorical map upside down. I am lost. My story is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Square one-ing, I sigh and turn the map, hoping the improved POV will help me, first, find my story, and second, get my story from A to Z. Or A to B.</p>
<p>Muddling and Experimenting is a period of getting excited about brilliant ideas, only to realize the ideas are poop. It&#8217;s a period of yelling at my muses: &#8220;SPEAK ENGLISH PLEASE!&#8221; Because they are clearly not. Sometimes they are not speaking at all. Sometimes they are drunk or playing Minecraft or fly fishing in Montana.</p>
<p>Don’t even get me started about the thousands of pages I write, then realize they do nothing to further plot or heighten tension. Being a waste-hater, I tenderly swaddle these precious scene-babies in a file I call <strong>WIP-junkyard.doc</strong>, certain I will find a way to repurpose them in another story. Ha! Do you reuse your appendix after an appendectomy? No. Not even as a doorstop or a pin cushion. After filling (and never returning to) many <strong>WIP-junkward.doc</strong> docs, I have come to accept the same is true for these vestigial words. Maybe that&#8217;s OK. Maybe unused words are a necessary part of the process. Maybe experimentation is not a waste.</p>
<p>Regarding experimentation: I recently came across an article about <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/nov/06/scientists-outshine-arts-students-with-experiments-in-creative-writing">scientists taking creative writing classes</a>, and I thought of Heather, my friend who has an MD/PhD <em>and</em> her own research lab. Heather is devoted to the discovery of novel genomic disorders-conditions caused by small deletions or duplications of DNA, and she has been involved in the discovery and characterization of several new genomic disorders, including deletions of chromosomes 1q21, 15q13 and 17q12.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand anything in that previous sentence.</p>
<p>BUT! <em>Heather</em> doesn&#8217;t write fiction. <em>Heather</em> may find cures to epilepsy, but we writers are the brilliantly creative ones. We are the artists. Scientists focus on one itsy-bitsy gene. <i>We</i> focus on the genetic make-up of an entire story. Take that!</p>
<p>This professor, however, was impressed with his science-students&#8217; creative writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the year of reading and writing and observing, students learn to tolerate uncertainty in process and outcome, embrace risk (creative, intellectual and performance) and practice humility – since writing is an exercise in failing better each time. Their writing is imaginative in theme and topic. They do not fall fatally in love with their work and will abandon experimental dead ends. Their killer work ethic sustains them through the endless revision that is essential to good writing.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK. Right. Heather likely wouldn&#8217;t have discovered the deletions of chromosomes 1q21 (huh?) if she couldn&#8217;t tolerate uncertainty. It is risky to work on something uncertain. It can feel inefficient. But I bet even King Stephen of Efficiencyshire tolerates uncertainty in process and outcome. I bet he sees &#8220;practice&#8221; instead of &#8220;waste.&#8221; And he keeps writing stories, one each season.</p>
<p>While it may take several seasons to find my way <em>to</em> the story, and several more to find my way <em>through</em> the story, it seems to be a necessary phase in my process, a process that stems, perhaps, from a literary disorder due to the chromosomal deletion of 17q12. Oh well. I bet Mr. King also has a semi-quirky genetic situation, deletions or duplications that float around in his <em>Carrie/Shining/Cujo/</em><em>It/Misery</em>-creating DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Now will you share some details of your personal process? What do you call your various phases of story-making? How have you learned to tolerate uncertainty or found ways to increase your efficiency? Do you think &#8220;Fritz&#8221; is a pseudonym? </strong></p>

<p><strong>The Art of the Comp</strong></p>
<p>Many authors resist having their books compared to others. Most of us are striving for originality, to write a book that no one else has written or could write. But there’s an art to coming up with the right comparison (“comp” for short) that can pique the interest of readers. And comparisons in publishing are inevitable; why not be the first out of the gate with the right one?</p>
<p>My book, <em>The Magician’s Lie</em> (out today!) is about a famous female illusionist in 1905 who comes under suspicion for murder. So yes, it’s probably the only book that fits that description, and for readers who are particularly passionate about that time period, or magicians, or murder mysteries, that pitch might be enough.</p>
<p>But if I’ve only got a few moments to tell someone about the book – or if there’s only room in print or online for a single sentence – I might be better off using this comp: it’s <em>The Night Circus</em> meets <em>Water for Elephants</em>. There’s good reason to think that readers who enjoyed one or both of those comp titles would enjoy<em> The Magician’s Lie</em> as well.</p>
<p>(It doesn’t hurt that both were bestsellers. <em>The Magician’s Lie</em> could just as accurately be described as <em>Alias Grace</em> meets <em>Carter Beats the Devil</em>, but the number of people who’ve read both of those books is probably in the thousands, not the millions. You could also throw <em>The Usual Suspects</em> into the mix, but books are better comps than movies.)</p>
<p>There are dangers, of course. You never know how readers might feel about a particular title. My Goodreads reviews often cite one or both of the comp titles, but in very different ways. A few direct quotes:<span id="more-35171"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>This really is a mixture of <em>The Night Circus</em> – the elaborate lifestyle, traveling by train for a show a night, the magic of it all – meets <em>Water for Elephants</em> – the darker elements of abuse and psychological distraught.</li>
<li>Touted by critics as a novel for fans of <em>Water For Elephants</em> and <em>The Night Circus</em>, I must admit to being like many of Arden’s audience members, skeptical.</li>
<li>The description of a mix of <em>Water for Elephants</em> and <em>The Night Circus</em> are what drew me to this title, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Magicians-Lie-Novel-Greer-Macallister/dp/1402298684/ref=writunbo-20"><img class="alignright  wp-image-35189" src="http://writerunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Unknown.jpeg" alt="Unknown" width="244" height="370" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>When anything tries to compare itself to <em>The Night Circus</em> I am hesitant. <em>The Night Circus</em> is such a hauntingly beautiful novel that holds such a special place in my heart that nothing ever seems to come close to touching it.</li>
<li>For me, the first promo/review I read, comparing this book to <em>The Night Circus</em> meets <em>Water for Elephants</em> was a disservice to the book.</li>
<li>While the book has been compared to <em>The Night Circus</em>, I liked it much better.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve seen this book compared to <em>The Night Circus</em> and <em>Water For Elephants</em> so I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect because I loved <em>Water For Elephants</em>, but I didn&#8217;t care for <em>The Night Circus</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course your readers aren’t limited to the comp you came up with. More Goodreads quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you liked <em>The Night Circus</em>, with the feel of <em>Downton Abbey</em>, you’ll enjoy <em>The Magician’s Lie</em>.</li>
<li>It reminded me of <em>Carter Beats the Devil</em> which I also loved.</li>
<li>I enjoyed the homage to <em>One Thousand and One Nights</em>, as Arden weaves the story of her life, and was intrigued by the duel between these two characters.</li>
<li>It evoked the same feelings I felt whilst reading <em>Like Water for Chocolate.</em></li>
<li>This novel is a concoction of <em>The Night Circus</em>, <em>Water for Elephants</em>, a splash of <em>Downton Abbey</em>, a pinch of <em>American Horror Story: Freak Show</em>, and a sprinkle of <em>The Hunger Games</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a healthy debate about whether comps should be used in query letters, and I think that’s a discussion for another day. But as a way to help potential readers connect with your book, definitely keep the idea of the comp in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Do comps make you more curious to read a book? Are there some examples of particularly good comps you can share? Have you ever used comps for one of your books?</strong></p>
