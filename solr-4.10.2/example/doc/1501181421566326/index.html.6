				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="triberr_endorsement"></div><p><b>As writers, we want to make our characters as unique and interesting as possible. One way to do this is to give your character a special skill or talent that sets him apart from other people. This might be something small, like having a green thumb or being good with animals, to a larger and more competitive talent like stock car racing or being an award-winning film producer. </b><br />
<b><br />
</b><b>When choosing a talent or skill, think about the personality of your character, his range of experiences and who his role models might have been. Some talents might be genetically imparted while others are created through exposure (such as a character talented at fixing watches from growing up in his father’s watch shop) or grow out of interest (archery, wakeboarding, or magic). Don’t be afraid to be creative and make sure the skill or talent is something that works with the scope of the story. </b></p>
<div> <img class=" size-medium wp-image-11921 aligncenter" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/farming-300x205.jpg" alt="farming" width="300" height="205" /></div>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #800000;">FARMING</span></h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Description</b></span>: The planting and nurturing of seeds to maturity for consumption and profit. There are many steps to farming, including preparation of the land using tools and machinery, understanding the needs of one&#8217;s crops as far as irrigation, nutrients and optimal sunlight conditions, and being able to harvest at the correct time, using methods that are economical as well as efficient. The result is the careful collection and storage of a crop that avoids as much product waste as possible. Crops might be for human or animal consumption, and are specific to the climate and growing zone. Most farmers also cultivate different types of crops (or raise livestock) to lower the risk if a particular crop does not do well in any given year.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Beneficial Strengths or Abilities</b></span>: being physically strong and steady, having a deep interest in (and respect for) the land and farm lifestyle, the ability to manage one&#8217;s resources well, a keen eye for early signs of problems (such as pest and drought indicators, or an imbalance in the soil&#8217;s nutrients), being mechanically minded to fix and maintain one&#8217;s own machinery, having a gift for repurposing so nothing is wasted, carpentry skills (to build sheds, fences, etc.), an affinity for animals, handiness with a rifle for protection if wildlife is a factor, a proactive nature, contentment with a quieter way of life, etc. Many people who farm also try to provide their own food, so gardening skills and being able to raise and care for animals properly are also good skills to have.<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://writershelpingwriters.net/2010/10/character-traits-thesaurus-collection/">Character Traits</a><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;"> Suited for this Skill or Talent</span></span></b><span style="color: #000000;">: self-sufficient, hard working, patient, perseverance, helpfulness, calm, intelligence, deep thinking, clever, curiosity<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Required Resources and Training</b></span>: Often people who grow crops or plants are those who have been raised on farms, and so exposure to the growth cycle and the routine of planting and harvesting over the years leads to rich experience on all aspects of farming. Understanding the climate is key, as not all crops are suited for all areas, and have different challenges to overcome. Farmers run and maintain their own equipment and structures, so mechanical and building knowledge is part of the package. Budget and resource management is necessary as yields are not always uniform, and paychecks are not consistent. Equipment breakdowns are expensive, so planning for emergencies is also a way of life for farmers.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Associated Stereotypes and Perceptions</b></span>:<br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Farming is dull and boring, and so the people who farm must be too</li>
<li>It is difficult to make money farming as crops are dependent on climate</li>
<li>Farming is a quiet life with little human interaction outside of family</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Scenarios Where this Skill Might be Useful</b></span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>understanding the cultivation of seeds is important to survival if goods are not readily available (or are expensive)</li>
<li>farming skills would be highly valued in situations where communities are starting anew with fewer resources (after a war, a forced relocation, etc.)</li>
<li>providing for oneself and one&#8217;s family during a time where income is not readily available decreases dependency on other people</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="triberr_endorsement"></div><p>Boy, there are some great pictures coming in from our <a href="http://writershelpingwriters.net/2015/01/100k-book-milestone-celebrate-us-win/">100,000 Book Milestone Giveaway</a>. Have you entered yet? If not, click the link above to fill out the form &amp; possibly win one of 10 print copies of either the <em>Emotion</em>, <em>Positive Trait</em> or <em>Negative Trait</em> Thesaurus books. (Unlike most print book giveaways, <strong>this one is open internationally, too!</strong>)</p>
<p>It is so neat to peer at your work spaces, meet your pets and see your smiling faces in all of these pictures. Too, the stories are great &#8212; so many of you have shared tidbits about how your use our books, what you have accomplished with them and how they are constant writing companions. This is just so gratifying for us to hear, so thank you for this gift!</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Here are a few of the pictures rolling in:</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Harry-Olsen.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-12042 alignleft" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Harry-Olsen-300x225.jpg" alt="Harry Olsen" width="261" height="196" /></a>Here we have <strong>Harry Olsen</strong> working on his latest project of awesomeness.</p>
<p>50 Points to Gryffindor for managing to take a selfie that gets him, his books, his laptop and his printed work in process ALL IN ONE SHOT!</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Leslie-Zampetti.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-12057 alignright" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Leslie-Zampetti-300x225.jpg" alt="Leslie Zampetti" width="224" height="168" /></a>Next is the talented <strong>Leslie Zampetti</strong> and her strange electronic device that is actually a portal to another realm. On it, she types magical words that will transport readers into the story world.</p>
<p>Holy zombie cows, I NEED one of these mystical novel-making devices. (And I wish my writing space was as neat as hers too!)</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Jan-Markley.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-12045 alignleft" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Jan-Markley-300x224.jpg" alt="Jan Markley" width="283" height="211" /></a>And here&#8217;s Sprite, <strong>Jan Markley</strong>&#8216;s cat, drinking a mug of whiskey (er, I mean tea OF COURSE!) and likely plotting mayhem that will bring about a fiery apocalypse.</p>
<p>Who killed the <em>Dead Bird Through The Cat Door</em> (Jan&#8217;s MG novel on screen?) If it wasn&#8217;t Colonel Mustard with a wrench in the library, then my vote goes Sprite, after a drinking and catnip binge.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Lisanne-Cooper.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-12063 alignright" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Lisanne-Cooper-225x300.jpg" alt="Lisanne Cooper" width="193" height="257" /></a>Up next is a picture sent in by <strong>Lisanne Cooper</strong>, who is obviously a huge fan of the <em>Negative Trait Thesaurus</em> in particular. Why you ask? Because she painted her wall the same shade!</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">THAT IS DEDICATION, People.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sabrina-Ramoth.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-12066 alignleft" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sabrina-Ramoth-300x300.jpg" alt="Sabrina Ramoth" width="193" height="193" /></a>And sweet lord of chocolate goodness&#8230;are those BROWNIES?</p>
<p>Oh, you delicious tease. I wish I was at <strong>Sabrina Ramoth</strong>&#8216;s house RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p>(Looks like she&#8217;s cued up Scrivener and is knee deep in creativity!)</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Angie-Aker1.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-12072 alignright" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Angie-Aker1-300x200.jpg" alt="Angie Aker" width="257" height="171" /></a><strong><span style="color: #800000;">FACT:</span></strong> <strong>Angie Aker</strong> not only has a fabulous name, she also has a well-loved Emotion Thesaurus.</p>
<p>Bring on the folded corners, the highlights and pen notations! This is what we like to see because it means she is getting serious miles from her book as she uses it.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Janet-Boyer.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-12048 alignleft" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Janet-Boyer-300x225.jpg" alt="Janet Boyer" width="231" height="173" /></a>Budding writer <strong>Noah</strong> is taking after his mom <strong>Janet Boyer</strong>. This means serious lessons in &#8220;sharing&#8221; as they swap all three books back and forth.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">There is a dark side of having a child take on the family business, as illustrated here by the pictures below.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Heather O&#8217;Connor</span></strong> sent in these pictures she snapped of a <strong>LIVE book theft</strong> in action when her daughter <strong>Alison</strong> got too close to the bookshelf&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">(<strong>WARNING: </strong>Graphic images&#8230;writers with weak stomachs may want to look away)</span></p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Heather-OConnor1.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-12084 alignnone" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Heather-OConnor1-225x300.jpg" alt="Heather OConnor1" width="131" height="175" /></a> <a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/heather-Oconnor2.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-12087" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/heather-Oconnor2-300x225.jpg" alt="heather Oconnor2" width="173" height="129" /></a><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/HeatheroConnor3.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-12090 alignnone" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/HeatheroConnor3-300x225.jpg" alt="HeatheroConnor3" width="168" height="126" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to lie&#8230;it was a grueling battle. Outside, lightning forked across the sky and booms of thunder shook the house. An orchestra showed up and began to play epic battle music as the tug of war raged on. Alison finally prevailed by throwing a handful of colorful M &amp; M&#8217;s into the air. Her mother, as you might imagine, was helpless against their chocolatey power (No one can resist M &amp; M&#8217;s).</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/HeatherOconnor4.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-12147 alignleft" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/HeatherOconnor4-300x225.jpg" alt="HeatherOconnor4" width="235" height="176" /></a><br />
Heather might not see her books for awhile, but we appreciate the book love, no matter how you slice it.</p>
<p>(And please, keep those pictures rolling in!)</p>
<h1><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Paying It Forward</span></strong></h1>
<p>Each year, Becca and I choose a charity to sponsor here at Writers Helping Writers. So far we have donated $2500 to organizations such as <a href="http://www.heifer.org/">Heifer International</a> (mission: to End Poverty) and the <a href="http://www.polarisproject.org/index.php">Polaris Project</a> (mission: to stop Human Trafficking). So know that when you purchase a book of ours, you are also sending along some much needed help to someone else!</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/farm-sactuary.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-12120 alignleft" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/farm-sactuary-300x167.jpg" alt="farm sactuary" width="300" height="167" /></a>This year, Becca and I will be donating to <a href="http://www.farmsanctuary.org/">Farm Sanctuary</a>. This charity focuses on rescuing animals from cruelty, re-educating people and advocating for humane treatment.</p>
<p>We are able to do this because of your kind support, so thank you so much!</p>
<p>Happy writing!</p>
<p>Angela &amp; Becca</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="triberr_endorsement"></div><p>Well, it happened. Our small, unusual trio of writing books have officially sold 100,000 copies, which is so freaking incredible. When we launched <em><a href="http://writershelpingwriters.net/the-emotion-thesaurus-a-writers-guide-to-character-expression/">The Emotion Thesaurus</a> </em>in May of 2012, and then followed up with <em><a href="http://writershelpingwriters.net/bookstore/">The Positive and Negative Trait books</a></em> in October of 2013, we never expected this to happen. (In fact, I remember telling Becca when we wrote the Emotion Thesaurus, I would be happy if it sold 50,000 copies in our lifetime!)</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/NEG-Framed.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1399" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/NEG-Framed-215x300.jpg" alt="NEG Framed" width="147" height="206" /></a><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Emotion-Thesaurus-400-border.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-10715" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Emotion-Thesaurus-400-border-211x300.jpg" alt="Pageflex Persona [document: PRS0000046_00058]" width="145" height="206" /></a><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/PA-Framed.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1400" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/PA-Framed-218x300.jpg" alt="PA Framed" width="149" height="206" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="triberr_endorsement"></div><p><b>As writers, we want to make our characters as unique and interesting as possible. One way to do this is to give your character a special skill or talent that sets him apart from other people. This might be something small, like having a green thumb or being good with animals, to a larger and more competitive talent like stock car racing or being an award-winning film producer. </b><br />
<b><br />
</b><b>When choosing a talent or skill, think about the personality of your character, his range of experiences and who his role models might have been. Some talents might be genetically imparted while others are created through exposure (such as a character talented at fixing watches from growing up in his father’s watch shop) or grow out of interest (archery, wakeboarding, or magic). Don’t be afraid to be creative and make sure the skill or talent is something that works with the scope of the story. </b></p>

<p>Instead, they are all of these things. Each has a set of good, admirable qualities, even while displaying frustrating or off-putting flaws. They have strengths and weaknesses in different areas, making them both skilled and inept at the same time. But that’s the point, isn’t it? The best characters are realistic and believable <strong>because they are just like real people.</strong> Like you or I. They have a <strong>balance</strong> of positive and negatives that give them a wholly unique viewpoint, attitude, belief system and personality.</p>
<p>Some writers want to create characters that ONLY have the best qualities, ones that prove they are good human beings that readers will admire and root for. They find it easy to create a blend of traits like loyalty, helpfulness, intelligence and determination, forming a true hero that can handle anything. But when it comes to choosing flaws, they pull their punches, worried that if they add a trait like selfishness, perfectionism, or impulsiveness, readers will view them as unlikeable.</p>
<p>Other writers EMBRACE the flawed character. They pile up flaws, forged by a hard past filled with emotional wounds that refuse to heal. They add layers of negative traits like suspicious, mistrustful and erratic, all carefully planned around an elaborate backstory that supports the necessity of emotional armor (flaws) that make them who they are.</p>
<p>But when it comes to admirable traits, they struggle. What positive traits would logically survive such a painful past? If say, the character was a victim of horrible abuse and to cope, they became a mistrustful, anti social liar, how can they also be friendly or kind? How can they logically be generous or carefree while harboring such deep flaws?</p>
<p><strong>These are not simple questions to answer. Character creation, when done well, is not an easy process.</strong> Too many flaws (or even choosing the wrong type of flaw), and a character becomes unlikeable. Too many positive attributes, and they come across as altruistic, unrealistic or even (yawn) boring. <strong>So how can we achieve balance?</strong></p>
<h2><span style="color: #800000;"><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/balance.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-11957 alignright" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/balance-300x300.jpg" alt="balance" width="300" height="300" /></a>Understand Who and What Shaped Your Character</span></h2>
<p>Just like every one of us, your character has a past. And while yes, backstory turmoil and pain should be exploited to create conflict and tension in the present, there is always good mixed with bad. In real life, the good experiences (and people) are what keep us going no matter how bad it gets. So think about your character&#8217;s positive experiences and past influences along with negative ones as you dig around in their backstory. Understand what the character learned from both past trials and successes, and how each lesson will help to shape his personality.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #800000;">Uncover Your Character’s Moral Center</span></h2>
<p>Every character has a set of moral beliefs, even the villain. Think deeply about the moral code your character lives by, and what lines he will not cross. (HINT: the “why” of moral choices will be embedded in his backstory, and who/what helped shaped his view of the world.) <strong>Morals are the pulsing heart of motivation and action</strong>, so determine your character’s sense of right and wrong. (Read more about determining your characters morality <a href="http://writershelpingwriters.net/2014/10/morals-basic-needs-influence-characters-strengths/">HERE</a>.)</p>
<h2><span style="color: #800000;">Prod His Wound to See What Hurts</span></h2>
<p><strong>Nothing modifies behavior like pain</strong>, so understanding what deep emotional wounds your character carries is key to knowing what he also yearns for more than anything (Acceptance? Love? Safety? Freedom?) This wound and the fear that it can happen again is what causes deep flaws to form. They act as “false protection” to keep the hurt from reoccurring, and usually hold people at a distance. Here&#8217;s a helpful list of <a href="http://writershelpingwriters.net/2014/02/help-character-wounds-list-common-themes/">Common Wound Themes</a>.</p>
<p>For example, a character who experienced rejection might close himself off from potential lovers because of his fear of being rejected again. How would flaws “help” him by pushing women away? Is he arrogant? Promiscuous? Uncommunicative? Dishonest?</p>
<p>And what attribute, if nourished, might grow strong enough to vanquish these flaws that hold him back from connection? Respectfulness? Honor? Loyalty? Empathy? <strong>Finding a major flaw&#8217;s opposite is the pathway to balance &amp; resolving Character Arc through personal growth.</strong></p>
<h2><span style="color: #800000;">Give All Characters The Chance for Redemption</span></h2>
<p><strong>Some characters are intentionally unbalanced.</strong> If you have a character who leans one way more than the other (such as a villain or anti hero) by story necessity, then make sure you also build in something that suggests no matter how flawed or terrible, there is a chance they can change or be redeemed.</p>
<p>Every negative has a positive, and no matter how dark or skewed a character’s view is, or what he feels he’s better without, there will always be a flicker of light that can help him find his way back to becoming whole and complete. <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/online-editor/when-flaws-go-too-far-avoiding-unlikeable-characters">Show this to readers</a>, be it a <strong>motive</strong> that is pure, a <strong>relationship</strong> with someone that is on some level healthy and good, or a <strong>positive quality</strong> that is admirable.</p>
<p>Balancing your character’s positive and negative sides means some deep brainstorming! If it helps, <a href="http://writersinthestormblog.com/2014/09/nanowrimo-prep-brainstorming-the-hero-before-you-start-writing/">here are some more ideas</a> on how to plan a character before you start writing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="triberr_endorsement"></div><p>Hi everyone! Welcome back from a wonderful break. I imagine, like us, some holiday rest and relaxation was just what the doctor ordered, but now you are getting a bit itchy, ready to jump back into the fray. To start things off right in 2015, we are diving right into the thick of writing technique with a guest post by author <strong>Raven Oak</strong>, who is joining us to talk about the successful pattern of Scene and Sequel.  This is a must read, especially for those who do not know about this technique. Trust me, your writing will thank you!</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Scene and Sequel </span></strong></h1>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/raven.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-11474 size-medium" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/raven-225x300.jpg" alt="raven" width="225" height="300" /></a>When I began writing seriously—not the scribbles in a notebook of plots I’d write someday or the half-started, never-finished stories I cranked out, but the &#8220;I want to write novels for a living&#8221; point in my career—my first completed book felt juvenile. Portions dragged. And those that didn&#8217;t, sped through the action without anyone stopping to smell any proverbial roses. So how does one develop solid pacing through a novel while building tension, developing characters, describing setting, and advancing plot lines? The answer is a little trick called <strong>Scene and Sequel</strong>. Why? Because humans like patterns.</p>
<p>Scene and Sequel is a technique developed by Dwight Swain in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Techniques-Selling-Writer-Dwight-Swain-ebook/dp/B0099P9UI0/ref=asap_B000APFNES_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417378861&amp;sr=1-1">Techniques of the Selling Writer</a>. (If you haven&#8217;t checked it out, I would strongly suggest doing so as he covers a wide range of simple tricks writers can use to develop better stories.)</p>
<p>Readers pick up a work because they want a powerful and emotional experience. It’s an escape from the drudgery of the real world and a way to live vicariously through others. As a writer, you must <strong>create</strong> and <strong>maintain</strong> an illusion strong enough to fool the reader. Pacing helps create and maintain this illusion.</p>
<p>Novels are typically comprised of chapters, which are often made up of scenes. To keep the ebb and flow of a novel going, each scene should then be identified as being a <em>scene</em> or a <em>sequel</em>.</p>
<p>A <strong>scene</strong> has the following pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Goal—what the character wants. Must be clearly definable</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Conflict—series of obstacles that keep the character from the goal</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Disaster—makes the character fail to get the goal</span></li>
</ol>
<p>And a <strong>sequel</strong> has the following pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Reaction—emotional follow through of the disaster.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Dilemma—a situation with no good options</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;">Decision—character makes a choice (which sets up the new goal).</span></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/18.-a-christmas-carol.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-11483 size-medium" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/18.-a-christmas-carol-248x300.jpg" alt="18. a christmas carol" width="248" height="300" /></a>To understand how this works, let’s look at <em>A Christmas Carol </em>by Charles Dickens.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;"> Chapter 1 is a SCENE </span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Goal—Scrooge wants money and to be left alone.</li>
<li>Conflict—When the charity solicitors and Scrooge’s nephew visit, they stir up feelings in Scrooge and memories of his sister, Fran. As Scrooge arrives home, he sees his old business partner’s (Marley’s) face in the doorknocker, and then later in the pictures in his fireplace mantel. Scrooge tries to dismiss the conflicting emotions/thoughts this stirs up.</li>
<li>Disaster—The disaster is when Marley’s Ghost arrives to warn Scrooge that three ghosts will visit him. Each one has a lesson to teach him. If he doesn’t heed their lessons, Scrooge’s afterlife will be full of pain and misery.</li>
<li>Scenes tend to be full of action and tension that push the plot forward. Remember, every scene you write must further the plot and/or further the character development.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;"> Chapter 2 is a SEQUEL </span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Reaction—Scrooge’s initial reaction is to write off Marley’s visit as the result of some bad food. When the Ghost of Christmas Past arrives, Scrooge tries to send him away. He claims he doesn’t want or need the lesson, but having no choice, Scrooge accompanies the ghost into the past.</li>
<li>Dilemma—As Scrooge journeys through quite a few joyful and painful memories, he begins to doubt the decisions he’s made. Scrooge faces a dilemma: whether or not to believe himself guilty of bad judgment and humbug, or whether to continue avoiding Christmas, its joy, and his family as he has for many-a-year. Neither are good options, so he picks the option he thinks he can live with.</li>
<li>Decision—Scrooge decides the past is too painful, because it’s made him doubt himself. In anger, he decides to extinguish the light given by the Ghost of Christmas Past, and thus, his own light. At least momentarily.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong>What a <em>sequel</em> does is give our character(s) an opportunity for reflection and self-introspection. The <strong>decision</strong> will lead us into our next <em>scene</em>, where the character(s) develop a <strong>new goal</strong>. In the case of Scrooge, Chapter 3 (scene) begins with a new goal: Scrooge reacted rashly in extinguishing the light. At the sight of the Ghost of Christmas Present, he decides he will go with him willingly and see what there is to see. And if necessary, think further on his own attitudes and prejudices. He’s not ready for a huge change yet, but <em>change is happening</em>—as change should be happening to your characters as well.</p>
<p>Scenes and sequels should continue to alternate the entire length of the novel, and in doing so, they’ll create a natural flow for both plot progression &amp; character development. Many authors plan or outline the sequence of events using scene &amp; sequel on index cards before writing.</p>
<p>Just about any novel you read will follow this rhythm. It seems simple, but structure usually is. Pick up a book and give it a flip through—I bet it follows the pattern!</p>

<p><span style="color: #800000;">Her name was Adelei, a master in her field, one of the feared Order of Amaska. Those who were a danger to the Little Dozen Kingdoms wound up dead by her hand. The Order sends her deep into the Kingdom of Alexander, away from her home in Sadai, and into the hands of the Order&#8217;s enemy. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">The job is nothing short of a suicide mission, one serving no king, no god, and certainly not Justice. With no holy order to protect her, she tumbles dagger-first into the Boahim Senate&#8217;s political schemes and finds that magic is very much alive and well in the Little Dozen Kingdoms. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">While fighting to unravel the betrayal surrounding the royal family of Alexander, she finds her entire past is a lie, right down to those she called family. They say the truth depends on which side of the sword one stands. But they never said what to do when all the swords are pointing at you. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="triberr_endorsement"></div><p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/new-year.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-11864 size-medium" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/new-year-300x233.jpg" alt="new year" width="300" height="233" /></a>Happy New Year, everyone! I am greatly looking forward to what 2015 will bring, and I hope you are too. This is the time for us to think about the year ahead, and how to choose achievable goals. If we want happiness and fulfillment to happen, we have to shape our own futures through hard work, concentrating on what is important to each of us so we can succeed.</p>
<p>One of the smartest things Becca and I started doing a few years ago was to create and follow a yearly business plan. We call it our &#8220;Plan on a Page&#8221; and keep it on the wall so we can reference it as needed while we work. Our plan isn&#8217;t complicated or difficult to follow&#8230;it simply outlines the major goals we want to accomplish for the year, areas of growth to focus on, and approximate deadlines (if they apply). This ensures that each and every day, we are working toward our goals, rather than getting sidetracked by other projects.</p>
<p><strong>Think about making a plan yourselves this year!</strong> First, <a href="http://writersinthestormblog.com/2014/12/gifts-that-matter-what-writers-need-most-this-christmas/">take some time for reflection</a>. Then, if you like, <a href="http://janefriedman.com/2013/12/03/business-plans-for-writers/">here&#8217;s a link to the template</a> Becca and I use, and some steps showing how to create a plan for yourself.</p>
<p>Speaking of what the year ahead will hold, Becca and I have two books we hope to release on The Setting Thesaurus. The timeline for this was to be Spring, but we are also working on a <strong>secret project</strong> that may bump our release date. I know, I know&#8230;delays are never fun. All I can say is that if we do not make the Spring release window, it will be for a very good reason. One that falls within the EPIC category. Okay, I better shut up about the whole thing now, because it is VERY HARD for Becca and I to stay quiet about <strong>this nameless cool thing</strong> in the works!</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #800000;">WINNER WINNER, CHICKEN DINNER</span></h1>
<p>Last month we held a contest for a two 25 page critiques, one from Becca, one from myself. I am happy to announce that <strong>Audrey King</strong> (Contemporary Adult Romance) and <strong>Rachel Seo</strong> (Upper Mid-grade Adventure) have been chosen by Random.org as our winners. Congrats, ladies! Watch your email boxes for further instructions!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="triberr_endorsement"></div><p>Hi everyone! With it being the Season of Giving and all, Becca and I thought we would wrangle together a small gift for you: <em><span style="color: #000080;">Emotion Amplifiers</span></em>, the popular PDF companion to <em>The Emotion Thesaurus</em>, is now an ebook. <strong>Even better, it&#8217;s</strong> <strong>free</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Emotion-Amplifiers-High-Res.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-11303 size-medium" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Emotion-Amplifiers-High-Res-219x300.jpg" alt="Emotion Amplifiers High Res" width="219" height="300" /></a>As writers, we all understand just how important emotion is. Commanding it well means creating authentic characters who share their raw, powerful stories with readers, pulling them in deep and making them care.</p>
<p><strong>But how do we push characters to the edge of an emotion?</strong> <strong>How do we draw out every last drop of tension that&#8217;s possible?</strong> The answer is to <span style="color: #000080;">amplify</span> <span style="color: #000080;">their emotions</span> through whatever means we can, applying pressure that tests limits, causes instability or even leads a character toward rash behavior, bad decisions, and ultimately, mistakes.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Emotion-Amplifiers-Angela-Ackerman-ebook/dp/B00QMLW34M/ref=asap_B0081BBQ7Q?ie=UTF8">Emotion Amplifiers</a></em> profiles fifteen different conditions (such as Pain, Exhaustion, Attraction and Addiction) that can help complicate a situation, causing emotional volatility and stress. Like <em>The Emotion Thesaurus</em>, each entry lists the Physical Signals, Mental Responses and Internal Sensations a character might experience while in the throes of an Emotional Amplifier.</p>
<p>We hope this ebook makes a strong addition to your virtual bookshelf, and helps you find creative and compelling ways to add complication to your hero&#8217;s rocky path toward his goal. <strong>Snag your copy (or gift it to another writer!) here:</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="triberr_endorsement"></div><p><em><span style="color: #ff6600;">As I&#8217;ve mentioned in other posts, there are a number of reasons why I may toss a book aside and never pick it up again. Clichéd characters, dragging first chapters, too much going on&#8230;the list, sadly, is long. (For my own personal list of what NOT to do in the opening pages of your story, check out the <a style="color: #ff6600;" href="http://writershelpingwriters.net/category/writing-craft/writing-lessons/what-killed-it-for-me/" target="_blank">What Killed It For Me</a> series.)</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #ff6600;">One of the things that most certainly WOULD kill it for me is when there are problems with the logic. If the author contradicts himself or something happens that totally doesn&#8217;t make sense&#8230;I don&#8217;t have much patience for that, and I don&#8217;t think most other readers do, either. Luckily, you don&#8217;t see much of this in published books because editors catch those mistakes. But it&#8217;s an issue I see quite a bit in manuscripts, and these little problems can slide your baby right out of an editor or agent&#8217;s inbox and directly into the circular file. None of us want that.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #ff6600;">So I&#8217;m excited to welcome Harrison Demchick today to talk about something we&#8217;ve never discussed before at Writers Helping Writers: logic problems in manuscripts and how to avoid them.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Have you ever read a scene in a novel, or seen one in a film, that flat-out did not make sense?</span></p>
<div id="attachment_11465" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/giacomospazio/4006502158/in/photolist-773nvq-rRNKP-dNs3fk-ZJV5H-5gsHU8-nqLgrm-bUGdgr-5frgPt-5ZpwLb-4w2N6o-7D6CGG-gBYQiM-8XDG2h-5sMNYe-7dCyZy-jFQFAc-dRzJTJ-DtacE-5TF6R-dB2Mfb-6Q7Qdu-6Q5pBE-6Q54qN-8jafVp-7DKNtS-5VB7CJ-7kbgX2-4zPtMh-aDee2P-5VB5nw-ghQKHA-8tvTUy-5J3N9e-6Xspsr-6P7118-br5ixp-bXRD4s-7Ajq3K-82kupm-edR5qb-bfjdmt-8LkQbM-6fV1W8-6gdqc9-7EvLHD-6Uerk-9Vx9iP-bfjcKt-PV679-9raMwk" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-11465 size-medium" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4006502158_c72a423f95_o1-300x157.jpg" alt="4006502158_c72a423f95_o" width="300" height="157" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Giacomo Spazio @ CC</p></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> I’m not talking about flying humans or talking animals or time machines. In their own contexts, there’s nothing illogical about any of these things, or for that matter anything else you can imagine. What I’m talking about are those moments where the protagonist says something he would never say or does something he would never do. Or those revelations that directly contradict already established fact. Or Halloween taking place two weeks after the Fourth of July.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">These are logic issues, and if you remember how they made you feel when you spotted them, you know how your readers feel when such problems emerge in your own work. Logic problems remove readers from the world you’ve created. They take from you your narrative authority. They undercut conflict and tension. And if not identified and fixed, they <em>will</em> ruin your manuscript.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So let’s take a look at four different kinds of logic issues, where they come from, why they’re a problem, and how they can be resolved.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">Type #1: Rule Violation</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> What it is: </strong>An apparent contradiction or inconsistency relative to the established rules of your world. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Some might suggest that there are no rules in fiction, but that, of course, isn’t true at all. When it comes to establishing the world of your novel, there are two sets of rules: the rules readers bring to the story and the rules you bring to the story.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What readers bring to the story is common sense. That’s why you don’t have to explain concepts like restaurants, Sundays, and love and hate, and also why you don’t need to tell readers that someone who falls into the Grand Canyon is probably going to die. You, on the other hand, provide basic context—the particular rules and concepts that differentiate (or don’t) your world from the real one. If, in fact, it is not lethal in your world to fall into the Grand Canyon, or if the bottom of the Grand Canyon is an enormous trampoline, then you need to establish this.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Common sense and basic context comprise the rules of your novel, and when those rules are ignored or changed without explanation—for example, a human having an intellectual debate on Tolstoy with a box turtle in a world previously depicted as ordinary Victorian-era England—then we have problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Why it’s a problem: </strong>In a world without rules, nothing has meaning. Imagine your protagonist dangling off the edge of the aforementioned Grand Canyon. The tension in such a scene emerges from readers’ understanding that an ordinary man who falls into the Grand Canyon will die. But if there are no rules—if rules are added or changed or removed on a whim—there can be no tension. Maybe the character will die, or maybe he’ll bounce, or maybe he’ll fly away. Readers don’t know. And most problematically, very soon, they won’t care.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How to resolve it:</strong> Establish the rules early in your manuscript, ideally before the inciting incident. This is more difficult in some genres than others—it’s hardest for fantasy and science-fiction, which require a lot of basic context—but generally speaking, you want to establish the status quo before you change it. And ideally, this is done through showing rather than telling. Convey from the beginning a world in which turtles can talk with humans and that Tolstoy debate will read just fine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">Type #2: Continuity Violation</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> What it is</strong>: A contradiction or inconsistency relative to anything that has happened in your manuscript up to any given point.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This one is pretty simple. Everything that happens in your manuscript—not just every event, but every detail established in every sentence—is part of your continuity, and when you contradict that, you violate continuity. A character established as twenty-two can’t be twenty-five the next day. She can’t live in a trailer park on page 12 and a studio apartment in Greenwich Village on page 60. She can’t be lactose intolerant, then eat a giant bowl of ice cream without consequence.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Why it’s a problem:</strong> When readers invest their time and energy in your manuscript, you essentially promise them that you’re the world’s leading authority on the story you’re telling. Continuity violations break that promise. For readers, this is intensely frustrating, because if you seem not to know what you’re talking about, their time becomes a wasted investment. When you lose your authority, you lose your readers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How to resolve it:</strong> First of all, be vigilant. Most continuity errors are simply mistakes. You forget what you wrote before, and thus accidentally contradict it. We all do it, and it’s not a big deal—just read carefully, and have someone else do the same if you know continuity to be a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">But you might also consider foregrounding. Foregrounding is addressing the continuity violation head-on, in the process making it part of the story. If something doesn’t make sense, but you or your characters acknowledge that it doesn’t make sense, readers will stick with you and accept it as either an intentional detail or something that will be explained later.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">Type #3: Inconsistent Chronology</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> What it is:</strong> Inconsistency in the established passage of time in your manuscript, or lack of clarity and logic in when events occur relative to other events.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We know, as part of common sense, that night follows day and that there are five days in a typical school week, but this doesn’t mean that time passes automatically and logically in your manuscript. I’ve edited three different young adult novels in which school weeks lasted seven days or more, all because the authors referred to “the next day” and “the next day” without keeping track of how many next days had passed. I edited another novel in which, due to overuse of “several months later,” winter lasted for more than a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Why it’s a problem:</strong> Continuity will frustrate you, but chronology will kill you. You can’t make your climax the Thanksgiving Social if only two weeks have passed from the start of the school year. You can’t have two characters start and end a journey at the same place and same time when one’s adventure lasted three days and the other’s a week. Inconsistent chronology can result in impossible plot points, and these issues are very difficult to unravel.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How to resolve it:</strong> If chronology is a concern, timelines can make a huge difference. Create a separate document keeping track of the passage of time in your manuscript. Know for yourself exactly when anything happens relative to anything else. If you write it down and make it a point of focus, you should be able to keep such problems under control.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">Type #4: Rationalization</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> What it is</strong>: Pushing your characters or plot in the direction you want them to go even when other logic issues make this unlikely or impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The killer strikes in broad daylight even though she’s previously only worked at night, and the only reason is that we’re nearing the end of the novel and the author wants her to be caught. A caring uncle abandons his niece and her friends because the author wants the protagonists to face the villain alone. These important moments are guided not by the needs of the story, but rather the needs of the author, who will spend paragraph after paragraph trying to rationalize her decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Why it’s a problem:</strong> I sometimes call this 2 + 2 = 5. It doesn’t matter how much explanation an author provides: two plus two will always come out to four, not five. Readers know that, and at heart, authors know that too—that’s why they’re working so hard to convince readers otherwise. Problems with rationalization make fundamental plot points impossible to believe.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How to resolve it:</strong> You can’t fix this one with foregrounding, because the explanation is often the problem. Instead, remember that you control both sides of the equation. If you can’t get two and two to equal five, change one of the twos to a three. Find another way to get where you want to go. Instead of forcing something that will never make sense, create something that will.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">While logic alone will never create a great manuscript, you can’t create a great manuscript without it. Don’t give your readers a reason to put your book away. Mind your logic.</span></p>
