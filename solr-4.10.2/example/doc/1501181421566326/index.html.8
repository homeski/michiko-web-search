<p>I call it LinkedIn Peeping — and it’s ideal for online lurkers.</p>

<p>Do you agonize over letters of introduction without ever sending them out?</p>
<p>I can relate. I’m shy when it comes to marketing myself to new clients.</p>
<p>But last September, I managed to (almost) skip marketing and still get high-paying writing gigs, with an easy LinkedIn marketing strategy.</p>
<p>I call it LinkedIn Peeping — and it’s ideal for online lurkers.</p>
<p>In three months, it’s landed me $7,500 in assignments, plus weekly red-hot leads. Not bad for a writer who was pulling in a big $200/month in 2013, writing for content mills and agencies.</p>
<p>Here’s how I used LinkedIn to land great freelance clients:</p>
<p><span id="more-4204"></span></p>
<h2>Three easy steps to get noticed by prospects</h2>
<p><strong>1) Do a <a title="The Laid-Back Method That Grows Your Freelance Business" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/laid-back-way-to-grow-freelance-writing-business/" target="_blank">LinkedIn search</a> for ideal customers</strong> in your niche. In companies, people who hire freelancers include the:</p>
<ul>
<li>CEO</li>
<li>Vice president of sales/business development</li>
<li>Marketing director</li>
<li>Communications director</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve had CEOs personally reach out or pass my profile on to marketing directors. A website project converted in days, since I was CEO-approved.</p>
<p><strong>2) Peep at similar people,</strong> once you&#8217;ve found a good prospect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the same titles and industries with different cities and countries. Go for world domination!</li>
<li>Visit your client’s profile. Look for “People Similar to Ideal Client.” This is a listing of people in similar industries and similar job titles on LinkedIn.</li>
<li>Also look at the “People Also Viewed” section. This will show you the people other users think are similar, which can be a broader group than what LinkedIn finds.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you and your dream client have mutual connections, <a title="5 LinkedIn Features Every Freelance Writer Should Use" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/susan-johnston-linkedin/" target="_blank">request an introduction</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3)  Join your ideal client’s groups</strong> and make contact with those inside. You never know — you might be the only writer in there.</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for discussions between CEOs and decision makers.</li>
<li>Like or comment on their discussions and see who’s viewed your profile.</li>
<li>Identify problems you can solve and share solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why peeping works</h2>
<p>When I was new to living in China, I was poking around on LinkedIn — and avoiding letters of introduction. Thinking I was anonymous, I checked out the profiles of CEOs in renewable energy and manufacturing in my new city, Tianjin.</p>
<p>But I wasn’t anonymous — and my name popped up in all those CEOs&#8217; &#8220;Who’s Viewed Your Profile&#8221; lists. And it turned out to be a good thing.</p>
<p>The next morning, a CEO I’d peeped at sent me an InMail, requesting a meeting to discuss a brochure for one of his companies. I wrote it, the brochure helped secure millions in venture funding for the company, and I landed an ongoing position with them as a marketing communications consultant.</p>
<h2>Engage to get even more work</h2>
<p>In China, I’m in demand as a writer in a town full of engineers, architects, and manufacturers. But I wondered: Could rarity be independent of location? I joined a manufacturing group and liked a CEO’s comment.</p>
<p>The next day, he sent me an InMail. He was thrilled to “find” a writer on LinkedIn, and he also needed a brochure to proceed with a deal worth millions.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now a convert to using LinkedIn to help clients find me, wherever they&#8217;re based.</p>

<p>There's a lot of confusion out there in the freelance-writing world today about blog posts and articles. Also, about what each of those types of writing should pay.</p>
<p>Recently, I got a lot of response to my call for freelance writers to <a title="Why you should stop writing blog posts -- and what to do instead" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/stop-writing-blog-posts-do-this-instead/" target="_blank">stop writing blog posts</a>. Many writers were confused about just what the difference is.</p>
<p>So let's discuss. Because things are changing. And understanding the differences between these two writing forms will help you earn more.</p>
<p>For years, blog posts and nonfiction articles were distinctly different:</p>

Many writers were confused about just what the difference is.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s discuss. Because things are changing. And understanding the differences between these two writing forms will help you earn more.</p>
<p>For years, blog posts and nonfiction articles were distinctly different:</p>
<p><span id="more-4032"></span></p>
<table border="1" width="100%">
<caption>Differences between Blog Posts and Articles</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="col" width="50%">Blog Post</th>
<th scope="col" width="50%">Article</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mostly your own opinion</td>
<td>Your opinion not allowed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No interviews or research</td>
<td>Has interviews and research from credible experts and research firms</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Short</td>
<td>Longer than 300 words</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Built around SEO keywords</td>
<td>Keywords not important</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Good spelling and grammar optional</td>
<td>Spelling and grammar are impeccable</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Casual writing style</td>
<td>More sophisticated writing style</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No editor involved; self-published</td>
<td>An editor cleans it up for you; published by a print magazine</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Freelance pay rates usually very low; much work in the $5-$20 per piece range</td>
<td>Pay rates from $.10-$1 a word and up</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Then something happened, and over the past couple of years, the lines started blurring.</p>
<h2>Blog-article convergence</h2>
<p>Blog posts started to get more and more like articles. As a bazillion blogs crowded the Internet, the bar began to raise.</p>
<p>Blog posts began to have more interviews. They presented interesting data. Posts got longer as bloggers sought to stand out and deliver more value, until 1,000 words has become fairly standard, and 2,000-word posts are not uncommon. SEO keywords&#8217; value lessened as Google cracked down on keyword-stuffed content. Also, as blogs got more professional, many hired editors.</p>
<p>On the article-writing side, there was also movement. Many print magazines began posting copies of their articles online. Suddenly, magazine headlines needed to drive traffic, just like blog-post headlines, and headline styles evolved. They published more opinion-driven pieces from thought leaders. Some also put up blogs where they let writers hit the &#8216;publish&#8217; button on their own.</p>
<p>Wordcounts shortened for print, as ad revenue migrated online. Some magazines went online-only. Their style got breezier and more casual.</p>
<p>To sum up, the two types of writing began to merge into one. Definitions got squishy, and now there&#8217;s a lot of confusion.</p>
<p>Except about one thing: Blog posts tend to pay crap, and articles tend to pay better.</p>
<h2>Client confusion</h2>
<p>Uneducated clients who don&#8217;t really know these two forms have been busy muddying up the conversation about them for years. That&#8217;s made it hard for writers to define writing projects and bid them appropriately.</p>
<p>There are plenty of clients out there who call the 300-word quickie posts they want &#8216;articles,&#8217; but still want to pay $5 for them.</p>
<p>There are also many clients who&#8217;d like you to write 1,000-word blog posts with two interviews and a research stat, but they&#8217;d like to pay $20 because &#8220;it&#8217;s a blog post.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your job as a freelance writer is to cut through the bull and get to what the assignment really is &#8212; then, talk about what that gig should really pay.</p>
<h2>How writers can earn more</h2>
<p>The fact is, clients are always going to try to get things cheap. It&#8217;s up to writers to educate clients about what they&#8217;re asking for, and what&#8217;s fair pay for what they want you to write.</p>
<p>The good news is, the convergence of blog posts and articles should offer writers better pay opportunities. Blog posts are growing up &#8212; they&#8217;re increasingly not the ugly stepsister of articles. So they ought to pay more like the articles they often are.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s up to the writer to take the steps to capitalize on this change in the marketplace.</p>
<h4>Some suggested steps:</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Define it.</strong> When a client tells you they want articles, or they want blog posts, ask them to define what they mean. Are there interviews involved? How many? What&#8217;s the piece length?</li>
<li><strong>Sway them.</strong> Sell them on the idea that what they want is considered an article by pro writers. It&#8217;ll instantly boost your rates. Make your case for why it&#8217;s an article gig.</li>
<li><strong> Sell articles.</strong> When you&#8217;re talking to clients who don&#8217;t quite know what they want, sell them on the idea that you should be writing an article for them, rather than a blog post, if they want their content marketing to be successful. Share the news of how Google is frowning on short keyword-driven posts.</li>
<li><strong>Sell blog upgrades.</strong> If they want posts for an existing blog, sell them on the value of taking their blog to the next level, to more of a reported-story, magazine-type feel, and what that could do for their reputation and visibility.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What to charge</h2>
<p>Where most writers are lucky to get $100 a post for blog posts &#8212; and I recommend you try to make that your floor for blog writing &#8212; article rates are usually much better. I&#8217;ve written many at $300-$500, and many more at $600-$2,000, depending on length and complexity.</p>
<p>Many smaller daily papers pay in the $75-$100 range for short articles, but have the advantage of giving you more impressive clips for your portfolio. You also get the bonus of learning to report a story, which lays the groundwork for getting better-paying articles in future, from businesses or magazines.</p>
<h2>Getting the win</h2>
<p>The fact is, articles and article-style blog posts convey more authority. They impress more of your client&#8217;s customers. The projects will be more successful, and those clients will be more likely to hire you back to write more. It&#8217;s a classic win-win &#8212; you can charge more at the start, and will likely end up getting more work from the client, too, because they&#8217;ll be happier with the results they get.</p>
<p>This all sets you up to go after better-paying magazine markets, too, if you have that goal in your 2015 to-do list.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re daunted by the idea of writing article-style blog posts or full-blown articles, <a title="Article Writing Masterclass" href="http://articlemasterclass.com/" target="_blank">learn more about writing articles</a>.</p>
<p>The idea of finding experts, doing interviews, or vetting research freaks out some writers, I know. But trust me, you can learn this stuff. I learned it all on the job, by trial and error.</p>

<p>When I started out as a freelance writer, I knew nothing about finding clients that pay well.</p>
<p>I started with bidding sites and general job boards, because I thought it was easy money. But I quickly discovered you can’t <a title="What it Really Takes to Make a Living Writing" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/what-it-takes-make-a-living-writing/" target="_blank">build a successful career</a> as an article writer if you’re only earning $5 per article.</p>
<p>It was clear I needed to make more money for each article.</p>
<p>So I stopped hanging out on the bidding sites and targeted higher-paying writing jobs. In one year's time, I went from earning $5 dollars an article on bidding sites to earning $900 for a feature article.</p>
<p>How? Here are the steps I took:</p>

But I quickly discovered you can’t <a title="What it Really Takes to Make a Living Writing" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/what-it-takes-make-a-living-writing/" target="_blank">build a successful career</a> as an article writer if you’re only earning $5 per article.</p>
<p>It was clear I needed to make more money for each article.</p>
<p>So I stopped hanging out on the bidding sites and targeted higher-paying writing jobs. In one year&#8217;s time, I went from earning $5 dollars an article on bidding sites to earning $900 for a feature article.</p>
<p>How? Here are the steps I took:</p>
<p><span id="more-4162"></span></p>
<h2>Leverage experience</h2>
<p>After starting at the bottom of the barrel in pay, I had nowhere to go but up, right?</p>
<p>And I did. I used testimonials and clips from bidding sites (published and ghost-written clips with the appropriate permissions) to apply to potential clients on job boards. This change in my marketing approach quadrupled my average pay per article from $5 to $20.</p>
<h2>Differentiate</h2>
<p>Although I had a tiny victory in raising my per-article rate to $20, I knew I had to keep learning to command professional rates. I looked for a way to set myself apart myself from the competition.</p>
<p>My first approach was to <a title="AP Style" href="https://www.apstylebook.com/" target="_blank">learn Associated Press Style,</a> the leading compendium of writing conventions that newspapers and magazines follow. Taking the initiative to learn AP Style using the latest guide, online resources, and my clients&#8217; unique style guides showed I was eager to learn and a quick self-study.</p>
<p>I used that knowledge — and my testimonials — to reach out to editors at trade publications and online magazines. This shift put me into the $.10-a-word range, <a title="How One Freelance Writer Got a 600 Percent Raise" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/freelance-writer-got-600-percent-raise/" target="_blank">ramping my income up</a> to about $50 per article.</p>
<h2>Learn and improve</h2>
<p>One trick I used to find my writing weak spots was to run my articles through Copyscape, comparing the draft I turned in with the final version. Comparing lede to lede, nut graf to nut graf, and so on, Copyscape highlights what clients kept &#8212; and what I needed to improve upon.</p>
<p>I also asked editors for feedback on what I did right and, more important, what I did wrong. This was helpful because the editor pointed out things I missed. I learned more about the publications&#8217;s voice, better ways to introduce quotes, article depth, and details on the intended audience.</p>
<h2>Build a portfolio</h2>
<p>Creating a portfolio gave me more confidence to quit bidding sites completely and rely only on reputable job boards that pay professional rates.</p>
<p>After a year of perseverance and prospecting to clients, I made a pitch to a nonprofit organization, and got an assignment for a $900 feature article!</p>
<p>This win came from my pitch to Best Friends Animal Society. The story focuses on how therapy dogs saved U. S. soldiers from physical/emotional disabilities (PTSD), and how the soldiers saved the dogs from being euthanized. A topic close to my heart — and a great fit for my chosen nonprofit.</p>

<p>Well, here's something interesting that just happened to me that explains why I keep encouraging writers to learn reporting: I did a Google search on a term, and got some results...and then a section of results labeled "In-depth Articles."</p>
</p>
<p>Article writing is the future. More businesses will be paying for it, online magazines are springing up -- the lucrative opportunities for writers who can develop a great idea, do a sharp interview, and weave it into a compelling story are growing like mad.</p>

<p>We've also got article writing on the brain around here because of an upcoming writing class I'll be teaching with Linda Formichelli -- we're giving out some <a title="How to find experts for your article" href="http://articlemasterclass.com/landing/free-article-writing-resources/#2" target="_blank">free article-writing trainings</a> to celebrate that right now, if you haven't seen.</p>

<p>When I first got into writing, I imagined I'd be living alone in some tiny apartment above a little boutique in some rundown alley, scribbling and starving.</p>
<p>My life didn't work out remotely like that. Instead, I'm a mom of three and married 30+ years! (Yes, thanks, I was a child bride.) And instead of writing alone in a garret somewhere, I wrote for editors at a string of publications, and later for businesses.</p>
<p>My point is, every successful writer I know has many people standing behind them -- family members, personal friends, writer friends, editors, mentors, and more. If you're a blogger, most of need tech helpers, too.</p>
<p>As we wind to the end of the year, I want to take a moment to recognize all the people who stand behind me, and who've helped me be a successful freelance writer and online entrepreneur.</p>

<p><span id="more-4129"></span></p>
<h2>The home team</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ll kick it off by mentioning that my husband has been an enthusiastic supporter of every single idea I&#8217;ve ever had for my writing business &#8212; even the ones that involved a decent amount of risk and the outlay of thousands of dollars. I know not every spouse is like that, and feel very fortunate. Thanks, honey.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also a super brainstormer &#8212; <a title="Larry Tice" href="http://seattledigitalvideo.com/" target="_blank">Larry</a> helped develop the name for <a title="Freelance Writers Den" href="http://freelancewritersden.com/" target="_blank">Freelance Writers Den,</a> for just one example.</p>
<p>All three of my kids have helped out here on the blog at some point, too, killing spam and doing other menial tasks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been lucky to have terrific mentors both as a blogger and a writer &#8212; <a title="Boost Blog Traffic" href="http://boostblogtraffic.com/" target="_blank">Jon Morrow</a>, <a title="Mary Jaksch" href="http://writetodone/about" target="_blank"> Mary Jaksch</a>, <a title="Danny Iny" href="http://www.firepolemarketing.com/danny-iny/" target="_blank">Danny Iny</a>, <a title="Ed Gandia" href="http://b2blauncher.com/" target="_blank">Ed Gandia</a>, and my departing <em>Forbes</em> editor <a title="Tom Post - Forbes" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/tompost/" target="_blank">Tom Post</a> among them. I&#8217;m still learning so much from each of you.</p>
<h2>My pro team</h2>
<p>If I rattled off everyone who helps behind the scenes in my business today, this would be a very long post. Let&#8217;s just say I sent out more than ten holiday gifts to my team this year.</p>
<p>Without this group below, I wouldn&#8217;t really be able to freelance myself anymore. Instead, I&#8217;d spend all my time trying to figure out how to make some widget work, probably while crying a lot.</p>
<p>Just a few of the essential people who truly are the secret behind my success:</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignright  wp-image-3259" src="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/Linda-LawnColor-150x150.jpg" alt="Linda-LawnColor" width="66" height="66" />Linda Formichelli</strong> &#8212; One of the best things that ever happened to me was winning Top 10 Blogs for Writers the first time, at the end of 2010 &#8212; mainly because that&#8217;s how I met Linda. She&#8217;s been a busy Other Den Mother the past couple years, and we also teach <a title="Useful writing courses" href="http://usefulwritingcourses.com" target="_blank">Useful Writing Courses</a> together, including the upcoming <a title="Article Writing Masterclass" href="http://articlemasterclass.com/" target="_blank">Article Writing Masterclass</a>. Linda is whip-smart, super-funny, and you should read her <a title="The renegade writer" href="http://www.therenegadewriter.com/" target="_blank">Renegade Writer</a> blog, if you&#8217;re not already.</p>
<p><strong> <img class="alignright  wp-image-4181" src="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/Keira-LinkedIn-150x150.png" alt="Keira-LinkedIn" width="59" height="59" />Keira Dooley</strong> &#8212; Keira created everything you&#8217;re looking at on this blog and on the Den site, on my <a title="Twitter - Carol Tice" href="https://twitter.com/ticewrites" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. Especially, all the pro-looking <a title="Article Writing Masterclass" href="http://articlemasterclass.com/" target="_blank">sales pages</a>, site logos, Facebook ads, and <a title="Ebooks for writers" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/ebooks" target="_blank">e-book covers</a>. To sum up, she makes me look like I know what I&#8217;m doing. She&#8217;s like a magical design fairy who waves her mouse and suddenly, I&#8217;ve got a sparkly gown and I&#8217;m ready to go to the ball.</p>

<p>I groaned when I read the email subject line, saying a former client had written a bad review of my business on a very popular online site.</p>
<p>This<a title="The Right Way to Drop a Writing Client: My 5 Tips" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/time-kill-writing-client/" target="_blank"> client had been a problem</a> for several weeks, and finally requested a refund. Despite my no-refunds policy, I agreed.</p>
<p>Because of a postal delay, that refund check didn’t arrive by the designated deadline. The client then sent an obnoxious email and posted negative reviews to Yelp and Thumbtack.com — sites where my profiles generate a combined 85 percent of my new client calls. Negative reviews on these important prospecting tools could tank my business.</p>
<p>Plus, the Better Business Bureau contacted me for a written response to his complaint there.</p>
<p>No question -- it was a client disaster in the making.</p>
<p>I know clients need to trust professional resume writers like myself, so this was a "do or die" situation.</p>
<p>How can you make a bad review work for you, and not against you? Here's what I did:</p>

<p>No question &#8212; it was a client disaster in the making.</p>
<p>I know clients need to trust professional resume writers like myself, so this was a &#8220;do or die&#8221; situation.</p>
<p>How can you make a bad review work for you, and not against you? Here&#8217;s what I did:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-4136"></span></p>
<h2>Calm Your Emotions</h2>
<p>My first reaction was frustration and slight panic.</p>
<p>Then I remembered what a former boss once told me: &#8220;How you react to a negative situation reflects on how you handle your business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another mentor told me to stick to the facts and not add any emotional responses to resolve complaints.</p>
<p>I analyzed the bad review to determine how to best respond professionally. Once I focused on the issues and trusted my instincts, the responses flowed smoothly. Plus, by focusing on the facts, you show professionalism and a calm demeanor while respecting the client. That impresses prospects that you won&#8217;t trash them online, either.</p>
<h2>Stick to the Facts</h2>
<p>This client claimed I missed multiple deadlines, including his refund, and attacked my integrity, work ethic, and work hours. And he claimed I was dishonest because I&#8217;d required full payment up front.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how I addressed each issue, showing ownership for what I could control:</p>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. Postal Service perhaps delayed delivery of the refund, which I can&#8217;t control. Once aware, I cut a new check and sent it certified mail. He received it in 48 hours.</li>
<li>To speak to my character, I mentioned a public service I provide the unemployed, and that I rearrange my schedule to meet writing deadlines.</li>
<li>I mentioned that payment up front is the norm for professional resume writers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reach Out to Happy Clients</h2>
<p>Wanting positive reviews to round out my page, I contacted past clients and sent my Thumbtack link. These bolstered my ranking and helped offset the impression given by the single negative review.</p>
<p>Thumbtack&#8217;s support team and the BBB raved at my professional responses, and the positive comments I solicited .</p>
<p>By staying positive, I&#8217;ve been able to find new clients and earn $1,100-$1,500/week, avoiding the typical seasonal famine that afflicts resume writers. And my <a title="How I Got a Great Freelance Gig After a Royal Screw Up" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/great-freelance-gig-after-royal-screw-up/" target="_blank">new clients</a> are excited to work with a professional.</p>

I know mine do.</p>
<p>Now&#8217;s the time to lay the groundwork to earn more in the months ahead.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also a busy time for many of us &#8212; there&#8217;s shopping, travel, vacationing, kids at home, visiting, decorating the house, and more.</p>
<p>Still, there&#8217;s one change you can begin making right now that I promise you will set the stage for a more lucrative freelance New Year. This will take a minute a day, tops.</p>
<p>It involves taking quick action to eliminate the single biggest problem freelance writers face.</p>
<p>Do you know where that massive stumbling block is located? Well, go to a mirror and take a look at your head.</p>
<p><span id="more-4130"></span></p>
<p>In my experience, the top problem freelance writers face is right there, between your ears.</p>
<h2>Here&#8217;s what needs to be different</h2>
<p>The biggest thing that needs to change to grow your writing income is your attitude.</p>
<p>We fill our heads with &#8220;that&#8217;s too hard&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m scared&#8221; thoughts, and then we don&#8217;t get paying gigs.</p>
<p>So this coming week, focus on changing how you view yourself as a freelance writer. Pop out that negative self-talk tape you&#8217;re playing, and write a new one to use for 2015. Yes, I do recommend you physically write it down.</p>
<p>Depending on what you&#8217;re struggling with, your attitude change might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beating yourself up about what you haven&#8217;t accomplished yet? <a title="A short prayer for freelance writers" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/prayer-for-freelance-writers/" target="_blank">Forgive</a>.</li>
<li>Worried you&#8217;re unqualified? Realize there are <a title="The credentials you need to be a freelance writer" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/credentials-freelance-writer/" target="_blank">no formal credentials needed</a>.</li>
<li>Afraid of being rejected? Relax &#8212; it&#8217;s <a title="How writers can stop being crushed by fear of rejection" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/writers-stop-being-crushed-by-fear-of-rejection/" target="_blank">sure to happen</a>, so no need to fear it.</li>
<li>Think you&#8217;re too young, or too old? Some client wants your POV and experience, as long as you <a title="How young writers are killing their chances" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/how-young-writers-kill-their-chances/" target="_blank">present yourself professionally</a>.</li>
<li>No work in your small town? Realize freelance writing is a <a title="Writers in charge - how to get lucrative freelance writing gigs no matter where you live" href="http://www.writersincharge.com/lucrative-freelance-writing-gigs/" target="_blank">global business</a> now.</li>
<li>Hesitant to ask for a raise? <a title="How to earn more money as a freelance writer -- no marketing required" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/easy-way-earn-more-money-as-a-freelance-writer-no-marketing-required/" target="_blank">Be bold</a>.</li>
<li>Hate marketing? Make a pact with yourself to <a title="Marketing my writing: How I learned to love it" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/marketing-writing-learned-love/" target="_blank">find a method you enjoy</a>.</li>
<li>Holding back because you feel a need to improve your writing first? Plan to <a title="Article Writing Masterclass" href="http://articlemasterclass.com/" target="_blank">take a class</a> to gain the confidence you need.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever aspect of your attitude needs adjusting, now&#8217;s the time to start thinking differently. It takes time to change our thought patterns &#8212; and its not easy.</p>
<p>Give yourself a few weeks to build your confidence now. Repeat your new attitude statements daily, and you&#8217;ll roll into 2015 ready to go after better-paying gigs.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s your new, improved attitude for next year?</strong></em> Leave a comment and share it.<br />

<p>You may keep strange hours. You may have to navigate periods of too much work — and the dry spells that sometimes follow.</p>
<p>The one thing you need most is the support of those around you. But sometimes they just don’t get it.</p>
<p>Here are the comments I’ve heard from people who don’t understand freelancing — and the responses I’ve used to help them get it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-4102"></span></p>
<h2>1. “If you had a <em>real</em> job, you’d understand.”</h2>
<p>For people who equate the word “job” with working 9-5, the world of freelance writers is baffling.</p>
<p>You see the late nights, early mornings, and weekend work. They picture you napping during the day and binge-watching Netflix.</p>
<p>Comments like these are hurtful, no doubt. But they’re often said because of a true lack of understanding (or even a little tinge of jealousy), and not out of spite. Knowing this can help to lessen the sting.</p>
<p>Instead of throwing a jab back, try educating the person about what life is really like for freelance writers. When they toss an, “If you had a real job” your way, you can say,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Actually, I’ve got deadlines to meet and clients counting on me just like you do. Every morning I get up at 7:30, answer e-mails from clients, spend some time brainstorming story ideas, put together pitches for magazines, and scout out potential new clients.</p>
<p>&#8220;I break around noon for lunch, probably like you do when you’re at work, then I get back to it and spend time writing and revising copy, meeting with clients in person or on the phone, and sending invoices. It&#8217;s a real job &#8212; I’m just doing it in my home.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>2. “What do you <em>do</em> all day?”</h2>
<p>This may come from a friend who has the day off and wants you to join them somewhere. Or it could be an honest question from a family member who just isn’t thinking about the implications of their words.</p>
<p>Instead of laughing off the remark or rolling your eyes, try saying something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I usually start my day by answering e-mails from clients. Then I spend the rest of the morning working on new projects, whether it’s writing an article for a magazine or handling copy for a client’s brochure.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the afternoon, I’ll work on pitching new clients or invoicing so I can keep the work coming in when I’ve wrapped up my current projects. Sometimes, I’ll have a meeting with a potential new client or a call with an existing one. I typically work until 5:30 or so, and may do some more work in the evening depending on deadlines.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s easy for someone to understand what a doctor or a teacher does when they head into work, but they may need more details to fully appreciate the <a title="New Data Reveals Why Today’s Freelance Writers Are Smart" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/freelance-writers-smart-stop-feeling-weirdos/" target="_blank">workflow of a freelance writer</a>. By hearing exactly what a day looks like for you, they’ll understand it’s not just about lounging around in your sweats.</p>
<h2>3. “Could you watch kids/do an errand for me?&#8221;</h2>
<p>You know the quality of your work suffers when you divert attention away from writing projects to child care or household chores, but this may not be apparent to others.</p>
<p>Explain to your family that <a title="How I Became a More Productive Writer by Doing This One, Simple Thing" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/productive-writer-one-simple/" target="_blank">your workday is like anyone else’s</a>, even if it happens at home:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It wouldn’t be a good idea if I showed up to your school or workplace with a load of laundry that needs folding, right? These chores wait until you come home, so you can concentrate during the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’d appreciate it if it could be the same for me. My work suffers when I’m trying to multitask, and I want to make sure I keep my clients happy by giving them 100 percent of my attention.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Whatever you do, keep your cool &#8212; and remember, the only one who really has to understand the freelance lifestyle is you. If friends and family don&#8217;t get it, <a title="Freelance Writers Den" href="http://freelancewritersden.com" target="_blank">find a writer community</a> where you can share your concerns.</p>

<p>It can be one of the most enjoyable assignments in journalism -- interview movie stars! Or music artists, politicians, magicians, authors, dancers, mega-church pastors. Pick your favorite celebrity flavor.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s often difficult to get famous people to grant you an interview. I spent 12 years pursuing CEOs of major corporations for interviews as a staff reporter, and I was a movie-industry secretary for several years, so I speak from experience on both sides of the fence here.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I learned: To get household names to slot you an interview time, you have to be wily, creative, and unstoppable.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>Here are my tips for landing celebrity interviews:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-4042"></span></p>
<h2>1. Start small</h2>
<p>Major celebrities want to be interviewed by people with a track record of interviewing public figures. So if you&#8217;re interested in this niche, look for ways to get started.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to interview Lady Gaga, start interviewing local singers in your town for the local daily or alternative paper. Into politics? Talk to your small-town mayor, or cover your city council for a local rag. If you swoon over actors, interview the star of your local theater production for a start.</p>
<p>Every town has local celebrities &#8212; the former Olympian or TV star from the &#8217;60s who retired there. Find them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s common these days for big celebrities to do group phone interviews, where hundreds of reporters might be on the line, taking turns asking questions. Don&#8217;t turn these offers down &#8212; go, listen, learn what the big outlets ask, and see if you can get in a question. Sure, it&#8217;s not an exclusive, but it&#8217;s a start at interacting with celebs.</p>
<p>Build up your celebrity-interview track record, so you can show clips that confirm you&#8217;re accurate and know how to get lively quotes from busy people.</p>
<h2>2. Work your connections</h2>
<p>Never assume you know no one who could give you an introduction to a celebrity. The way we&#8217;re all connected online these days, it&#8217;s six degrees of Kevin Bacon out there.</p>
<p>Remember, you may not need a connection directly to the celeb. An introduction to one of their handlers &#8212; manager, agent, publicist &#8212; might work just as well. Start by asking if anyone knows who manages your dreamboat (or Google it and see if you can find out). Getting a warm intro to one of the team could be all you need to get your interview idea a fair hearing.</p>
<h2>3. Appeal to their interests</h2>
<p>Do some research and learn about your celebrity. Do they have a pet charity they love to support? Did they found a charity of their own? Are they a born-again Christian? A Scientologist? A vegan? A motorcycle nut?</p>
<p>Think about publications that might want an interview with your target about that aspect of their life. Celebrities give many interviews, and they like variety. They get tired of being asked the same six questions about their upcoming film, and might love to talk about their new boyfriend, their customized Harley, their backyard organic garden&#8230;anything else.</p>
<p>Develop a focused angle for your interview that&#8217;s off the beaten trail and interest a magazine in it, and you might get a yes. A pitch like &#8220;I want to interview Joe Famous for X magazine&#8221; leaves the celebrity nervous about what you might ask.</p>
<h2>4. Be where they are</h2>
<p>One thing is as certain as the rising of the sun: Celebrities make personal appearances. They turn up at movie premieres and charity events and industry conclaves on a fairly regular basis.</p>
<p>Greta Garbo and J.D. Salinger are dead, and so is the concept of the reclusive celebrity. They all appear sooner or later, and they all want press.</p>
<p>Your job is to learn where they&#8217;ll be, and show up there. Yes, you might need to wangle a ticket to an event, or even buy one. But usually, there&#8217;ll be a media question time at these celebrity sightings, and you could get a chance to pop out a question or two.</p>
<h2>5. Persist</h2>
<p>Top celebrities often have multiple layers of protection around them, and it&#8217;s all designed to get rid of you. A hot actor may have both a manager and an agent, as well as a publicist and a personal assistant. You watched <em>Entourage</em>, right?</p>
<p>All of these people may need to confer and concur that your interview proposal is a good idea. That can take weeks.</p>
<p>Allow plenty of time. Often, you&#8217;ll have to gently follow up, over and over. Never, ever be angry with the team. That will kill your chances dead.</p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t hearing a yes, don&#8217;t just sit on your hands waiting. Keep developing thoughts and ideas and questions&#8230;and send them over. Try a junior member of the PR staff and see if you can pick their brain for tips. Propose different angles. See what might make the penny drop.</p>
<p>With some celebs, this may be a dance that takes years to complete. Just keep working at it and developing relationships with celebrity PR people.</p>
<h2>6. Use social media</h2>
<p>Social media has become the great workaround for reaching celebrities with an impenetrable PR wall. Many celebrities are tweeting their little hearts out. You can stalk venture capitalists on LinkedIn &#8212; I did that more than once for one of my <a title="How They Started" href="http://www.amazon.com/How-They-Started-David-Lester-ebook/dp/B008846LN0/" target="_blank">print business books</a>. I also got one of the biggest interviews in that book by leaving a comment on one very famous company founder&#8217;s blog.</p>
<p>If you think a prominent figure won&#8217;t return your tweet, I&#8217;ll just say that I got <a title="Entrepreneur -- Shark Tank effect" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/slideshow/224405" target="_blank">every investor on the ABC series <em>Shark Tank</em></a> to talk to me for one feature article &#8212; and I connected with most of them on<img class="alignright wp-image-4153 " src="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/Herjevec-answers-my-tweet.png" alt="Herjevec from Shark Tank answers my tweet" width="434" height="227" /> Twitter.</p>
<p>One thing I&#8217;ll note about that tweet on the right: My pitch there also uses tip #3.</p>
<p>What investor doesn&#8217;t want to brag about how smart they are, and how their picks did great? So I didn&#8217;t just tweet them &#8212; I had a question I knew they&#8217;d love to answer.</p>
<h2>7. Dig dirt</h2>
<p>There is one foolproof way to get a celebrity to talk &#8212; find out something scandalous about them that nobody else knows yet.</p>
<p>Comb court records for lawsuits. Interview their former housekeeper. Verify nasty rumors you hear.</p>
<p>This approach won&#8217;t be for everybody, but it&#8217;s the tabloids&#8217; bread-and-butter. Everybody loves an exposé. Even better, if you find your own facts, then you&#8217;ve got a story about a celebrity you can do, even if they <em>refuse</em> to talk. But most often, they&#8217;ll jump at the chance to spin the negative news their way.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s less common, you can also break stories and get celebs on the line by finding out something good that&#8217;s not common knowledge yet, too. That baby on the way, the hot new role they&#8217;ve landed &#8212; that works, too.</p>
<h2>Which comes first</h2>
<p>One of the big questions I get asked about celebrity interviews is who to ask first &#8212; the publication or the celebrity. The answer is the celebrity.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t ever want to tell a magazine you can deliver a celebrity interview, only to have to come back later and say really, you had no contact with that person and they&#8217;re not returning your calls. That can really blow your credibility with that editor.</p>
<p>What you can do is explore with a magazine editor whether they&#8217;d be interested in an interview with Jill Rockstar about X topic. You&#8217;ll almost always get a &#8216;yes&#8217; &#8212; and then you can take that to the celebrity&#8217;s people to show them their star won&#8217;t be wasting their time talking to you.</p>
<p>I once cold-called a celebrity magazine to ask if they were interested in a chat with a film star I knew I would be on-set with soon&#8230;and they about fell over themselves with excitement. They didn&#8217;t even ask to see my clips (which were nonexistent at that point).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got access to a celebrity, it can open a lot of doors. It&#8217;s worth starting small and building up some celeb Q&amp;A clips to show around.</p>
