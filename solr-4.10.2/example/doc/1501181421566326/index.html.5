				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend let's talk about marketing your freelance writing services (or marketing your books and blogs for that matter). Specifically, let's explore LinkedIn marketing.</p>
<p>I've put together three relatively recent resources that will hopefully help you get a handle on LinkedIn marketing. Rather than our typical "weekend reading" in this case we have one article, one infographic, and a slideshow.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Is the LinkedIn Publishing Platform Worth It?</h2>
<p><em>By Kelsey Jones at SearchEngineJournal.com</em></p>
<p>Who better to share LinkedIn marketing advice for writers than other writers? In this case, Kelsey Jones assembled quotes and tips from Search Engine Journal writers related specifically to the new-ish LinkedIn Publishing Platform.</p>
<p>Should you post your content on LinkedIn? Is it a smart idea to share duplicate content there, such as republishing your blog posts? See what experts like Neil Patel and Amanda DiSilvestro have to say.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/ask-writers-linkedin-publishing-platform-worth/113097/"><strong>Read the post.</strong></a></p>
<h2>5 Minute LinkedIn Management Plan for Users of All Levels</h2>
<p><em>Discovered via Mitt Ray at SocialMarketingWriting.com [Infographic from <a href="http://www.bluewiremedia.com.au/blog/2013/11/linkedin-marketing-strategy-infographic">Bluewire Media</a>]</em></p>
<p>If you feel overwhelmed by the idea of using LinkedIn for marketing, you'll love this infographic from Bluewire Media. It offers beginner, intermediate, and advanced tips for how you can engage in LinkedIn marketing no matter how little time you have (or want) to invest.</p>
<p>Only have five minutes? Three? One? You'll find simple LinkedIn marketing tactics you can use here.</p>
<p><a href="http://socialmarketingwriting.com/5-minute-linkedin-management-plan-users-levels-infographic/"><strong>Read the post.</strong></a></p>
<h2>LinkedIn Guide on Little Stuff</h2>
<p><em>By Cathy Miller at SimplyStatedBusiness.com</em></p>
<p>This post and SlideShare presentation come from friend and colleague, Cathy Miller -- one of the first people I'd go to with LinkedIn questions of my own.</p>
<p>Rather than focusing specifically on marketing, Cathy's slideshow covers basic tips and things you might not know about LinkedIn, especially if you're new to the network.</p>
<p>There are many good tidbits in there, and some just happen to help you use LinkedIn as a more effective marketing tool.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://simplystatedbusiness.com/linkedin-guide/">Read the post.</a> </strong></p>
<p>Do you have any favorite LinkedIn marketing tips to share? Tell us how you promote your writing business and build professional connections on LinkedIn in the comments below.</p>
<p>(Note: Please don't suggest spam tactics that violate LinkedIn's TOS and put user's accounts at risk -- like contacting and pitching people you don't know simply because they've viewed your profile, without asking to connect with you; those kinds of "tips" will be removed.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you consider yourself an ethical article writer or blogger? Whether you write for print publications or the web, professional ethics are an important part of building trust with readers and clients, which is part of what keeps them coming back for more.</p>
<p>My ethical standards won't necessarily look like yours, and vice-versa. For example, I have ethical issues with writing about certain topics that I don't feel are appropriate.</p>
<p>As an example, I wouldn't take on marketing copy for a company selling tobacco or articles supporting companies that I consider harmful to my audience. But beyond the issue of avoiding article <em>topics </em>you might consider unethical, how else can you maintain high professional ethics when writing for clients or even on your own blog?</p>
<p>Let's look at five things ethical article writers <em>wouldn't</em> do:</p>
<h2>1. Steal / Plagiarize</h2>
<p>Obviously it's wrong to steal material from another writer and slap your name on it. But ethical article writers also don't "rewrite" articles from another source (a derivative work which is still a copyright violation without the original copyright holder's permission). And if they pull inspiration from a single piece and want to expand upon the original article, they should cite the original source. But being inspired by another's article and rehashing it are very different things.</p>
<h2>2. Lie</h2>
<p>This should go without saying, right? Yet it's not unheard of for article writers, and bloggers, to flat-out lie in order to make a point. I remember one blogger a few years back who I caught lying on numerous occasions. For example, they started promoting something they used to speak out against. And when someone called them out on it, they lied, saying they'd never spoken out against the issue at all. That's because they deleted the older posts, and without realizing that email subscribers still had copies in their inboxes.</p>
<p>Lying is always a stupid move. Don't fudge stats, quotes, or anything at all to make a point in your articles. Either call your article what it is -- an opinion piece, paid advertorial, etc. -- or re-think your premise if you can't find facts to back you up.</p>
<h2>3. Libel Someone</h2>
<p>Along those lines, don't spread malicious lies about other <em>people</em>. I'm the last person who will ever tell you that you shouldn't call out BS when you see it, if you're the type of writer who's willing to do that and if it's appropriate for the article you're writing. But if you're going to go on the attack, keep it factual. Being negligent or willfully spreading lies that could hurt someone's reputation could cost you (and your clients) dearly.</p>
<h2>4. Fail to Disclose Sponsorships and Affiliations</h2>
<p>Ethical article writers don't hide conflicts of interest, such as writing a supposed news story about a paying sponsor, client, or company they're an affiliate of. This is especially important when there's any direct compensation involved, such as paid link placements within content, affiliate links, or a sponsor having any kind of control or influence over the article content itself.</p>
<h2>5. Skip Fact-Checking</h2>
<p>When writing new pieces or other articles that rely on supporting facts or information from third parties, ethical writers don't ignore fact-checking. That involves anything from double-checking statistics to verifying allegations with other reliable sources.</p>
<p>Look. Everyone makes mistakes. And ethical standards vary from person-to-person and publication-to-publication. But sticking to these guidelines can help you avoid crossing an ethical line you might later regret.</p>
<p>What other ethical guidelines do you follow in <em>your </em>article writing -- whether that's journalism, blogging, or some other kind?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's no secret that I usually have a lot going on as a writer. I run quite a few blogs of my own. I take on freelance writing projects for clients. I write nonfiction e-books. And I'm working on much more fiction this year as well. As a result, one of the biggest questions I get from colleagues in my network is "how do you juggle things?"</p>
<p>I've shared plenty of tips here in the past -- things I've learned that help me <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/7-ways-to-double-what-you-get-done-each-day/">stay organized and productive</a>. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>My four-day work week (and very early start time);</li>
<li><a href="http://allindiewriters.com/podcast/6/">My favorite productivity apps;</a></li>
<li>My love affair with to do lists;</li>
<li>And even how a simple <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/quick-tip-customize-your-browser-start-page-for-increased-productivity/">change in your browser's start page</a> can make you more productive.</li>
</ul>
<p>But when it comes to blogging specifically, editorial calendars have been a huge help. I've tried a variety of options from WordPress plugins and online services to <a href="http://offers.hubspot.com/blog-editorial-calendar">Hubspot's template</a> and simple Word documents. But in the few years I've been using them, I've struggled to stick with them until recently.</p>
<p><a href="http://allindiewriters.com/downloads/EasyEdCal.xls"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29637" src="http://allindiewriters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/easyedcal.jpg" alt="Easy Editorial Calendar Template for Bloggers" width="580" height="365" /></a></p>
<p>I've finally put together an editorial and content marketing calendar that works for me. It's simple. Like the Hubspot template, it's in spreadsheet form. But it's tailored to exactly the types of content I prefer to focus on.</p>
<p>I decided to create a scaled down version of it for the All Indie Writers community. This is about as basic as it gets -- monthly calendars that cover blog post ideas and social media updates tied to those posts. (The template is pre-set for the months of January - March 2015.)</p>
<p>It lets you plan your:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog post ideas;</li>
<li>Tweets related to those blog posts;</li>
<li>G+ updates;</li>
<li>Pinterest updates;</li>
<li>Facebook updates;</li>
<li>And other social media content to promote your posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also includes space at the end for other content ideas you might have for the month. I use that to keep track of longer-form content I'm working on for that site, such an an e-book or e-course. And it can be used to record extra blog post ideas so you have more options to choose from if you change your mind about a scheduled idea later, or if you find that you have time to post more frequently than expected.</p>
<p>You can "pretty up" the spreadsheet however you'd like (I'm odd, so I like to customize it on a site-by-site basis based on my blogs' color schemes). And you can add and remove sections for various social networks.</p>
<p>I hope you find it useful!</p>

<p>Years ago, you could have a billboard-style professional website and land plenty of clients. But over time, things have changed. Now it's important that your freelance writer website serves as more than an advertisement. If you want it to attract prospects through search engines or help you build a reputation that leads directly to writing gigs, your website has to offer more value than that.</p>
<p>One of the best ways you can get more out of your freelance writing website is to make it a go-to resource for your target prospects. And you can do this by making it a hub for information your prospects want in addition to promoting your services.</p>
<p>The idea is simple. You want high quality content to help you rank in search engines. And you want prospects to keep coming back. Why? Because not all prospects are ready and willing to buy when they first come across you.</p>
<p>By converting them from drive-by traffic to regular visitors you build relationships and you build trust. Then, when they <em>are </em>ready and able to hire someone, you'll be the writer they think of first.</p>
<h2>How to Keep Prospects Coming Back</h2>
<p>Not sure how to include value-added resources to keep prospects coming back to your freelance writer website? Let's look at some example content types you could use. You don't need to use all of them -- pick and choose from what you think will appeal to your target market the most.</p>
<p>Consider including:</p>
<ul>
<li>An industry-focused blog that benefits their business;</li>
<li>White papers and other types of reports;</li>
<li>E-books (free or premium);</li>
<li>Other downloadable resources like worksheets, checklists, and templates;</li>
<li>Courses (to teach prospects something they consider valuable);</li>
<li>Webinars (for more personal instruction);</li>
<li>An email newsletter that drives prospects back to your site;</li>
<li>Data (conduct surveys related to the markets your prospects target).</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine some or all of these ideas to help you build a more authoritative reputation among your target prospects. By providing resources that benefit <em>their </em>businesses on a regular basis instead of only focusing on yours, you have a better chance of converting those prospects into clients.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Even if most of your visitors don't ultimately hire you as a freelance writer, you can still make money by selling them information products. That lets you tap into lower-budget markets without having to lower your rates. It's just one more reason to make your professional freelance writing website a more valuable resource that can stand on its own.</p>
<p>Have you turned <em>your </em>freelance writer website into a go-to resource for prospects? If so, what resources did you choose to add, and why?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29606" src="http://allindiewriters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/makemoneyebooks.jpg" alt="Make More Money Selling Short Nonfiction Ebooks" width="551" height="512" /></p>
<p>Before the holidays I was talking to a few colleagues about my very first e-book. It sold reasonably well, or at least much better than I expected it to at the time, bringing in a little over $4000 in the year and a half it was on the market. It led to lucrative freelance relationships bringing in thousands of dollars in additional freelance writing work. And all of that came from just one weekend of work.</p>
<p>Those colleagues I was talking to encouraged me to share the story. So a few tips were shared in the most recent email newsletter about how you can earn thousands from a short nonfiction e-book, even without relying on Amazon and other e-book sellers. Some of that will be covered below (but if you don't want to miss similar updates, you can subscribe to the newsletter in the blue box in the right sidebar).</p>
<p>The story was also brought up in this week's podcast in response to a community question about e-book revenue. (<a href="http://allindiewriters.com/podcast/6/">Listen now if you haven't already</a>.)</p>
<p>And now I'd like to go into a little more detail so hopefully <em>you </em>can find similar success with your own nonfiction e-books.</p>
<h2>What I Did</h2>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of the process I used at the time:</p>
<ol>
<li>I drafted a short e-book of approximately 20 pages. Note: this was a traditional .pdf e-book, when 20-50 pages was the norm. These kinds of e-books can still sell well if you target the right markets. But if you feel more comfortable calling shorter e-books "guides" or something else, have at it.</li>
<li>I targeted the e-book to my target freelance clients. At the time most of my clients came to me for PR consulting and PR writing (press releases, media kits, ghostwritten trade features, case studies, etc.).</li>
<li>The edited file was converted into a .pdf version which was uploaded to my business website.</li>
<li>It was sold at a premium at $17, later lowered to $7, and after about a year and a half it was retired and released as a freebie. (Note: At that time I used ClickBank to sell the e-book, though I'd use <a href="http://www.e-junkie.com/">E-junkie.com</a> to do the same thing now.)</li>
<li>In addition to putting the e-book sales page on my business website (which already reached by target buyers and had decent search engine rankings), I promoted it on forums. This was the primary way it was sold.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why it Worked (and How You Can do it Too)</h2>
<p>As you can see, there really wasn't a lot to the process. And while I wouldn't do things exactly the same way now, it worked out very well at the time. (For example, while it makes sense to take on the writing and editing yourself if you release an e-book targeting your freelance writing client base, in the vast majority of circumstances, I'd highly recommend hiring an independent editor.)</p>
<p>If you're put off by the warnings that <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/podcast/6/">most indie authors don't sell many e-books</a>, pursuing short nonfiction e-books like my example might improve your chances of success. If you can use one short nonfiction e-book to generate five figures of income with a minimal time investment, imagine what you could do by publishing several.</p>
<p>If you'd like to try a similar approach, here's what made my first e-book so profitable:</p>
<ul>
<li>I targeted a highly-specific audience -- in this case owners of small online businesses who were brand new to press release writing and distribution and who were hesitant to spend money hiring a PR professional to handle those releases for them.</li>
<li>I built a solid reputation in a major forum catering to online business owners, many of whom were in my exact target market. And I was an active member of several others. I focused on giving solid advice related to PR (rather than constantly trying to sell things). That helped me become known as a go-to resource for the business owners hanging out there.</li>
<li>The e-book was focused on a very narrow topic -- writing and distributing online press releases. Go too broad in focus and you'll often end up light on information about the specific problems your buyers are trying to address.</li>
<li>The e-book focused on actionable information. When the information you provide helps the reader solve a problem or take advantage of an opportunity, they're often willing to pay a premium for that information. Again, the more specific the better.</li>
<li>People reluctant to hire a professional freelancer are often more willing to try something themselves. Information teaching them how to do that is often cheaper than hiring a pro for a single project, even at a premium (no Amazon pricing mentalities here). That can lead to relatively easy sales.</li>
<li>Highly-specific target markets are usually rather small. But by pricing at a premium, you don't have to make a lot of sales to have a profitable e-book on your hands. Bonus points if the information isn't easy to come by (or at least not from trusted sources). I was one of the earlier online PR specialists, which gave me an edge -- there wasn't very much information out there about online-specific press release formatting and distribution when it was released.</li>
<li>The e-book could be tied to another income stream. In my case it was tied to freelance writing and PR consulting services. I knew from the start that the initial price wouldn't be the permanent price. But while the demand existed, before others rushed into the market, I made the most of it. But no matter how that turned out, I knew it would pay off more by building trust with freelance prospects.
</p>
<p>Some bought the e-book, used it to handle their own projects, and I made money from the e-book sale. Others bought the e-book, read it, decided the DIY route looked like too much work, and hired me. And others put the e-book to use with a DIY release, realized that they could have gotten even better results with a PR pro's help, and hired me for their next project.</p>
<p>That led to several lucrative client relationships, bringing in thousands of dollars over the years, all in addition to the $4000 or so in direct sales.</p>
<p>This is an area where nonfiction e-books shine. It's easy to tie them to other revenue streams to increase your overall return on investment. That might be freelance writing services, consulting, webinars, longer print books, other e-books, e-courses, or any other product or service related to the same target market.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember. This was my first e-book, created largely as a test and mostly as an authority piece. While its success made it a very profitable project, I'd consider it a moderate success at best. With a little more time to sink into a premium-value e-book or guide (and an ability to tie it to a larger revenue plan), you can earn even more than I did.</p>
<p>Have you ever used this kind of short nonfiction e-book to promote other services or products? Did you extract direct income from it through sales first, or did you go right to a free release? Tell us about your niche and how similar strategies worked within it by leaving a comment below.</p>

<p>Given that we've just started a new year, it seems fitting to talk about writing motivation. After all, most of us have probably set at least <em>one </em>new writing goal or resolution, right? But how are we going to <em>stick </em>with those goals (and should we)?</p>
<p>I want to share three great articles with you on the topic of writer motivation -- maybe to inspire you and maybe to rethink being hard on yourself if everything doesn't go according to plan.</p>
<h2>Motivation vs. Habit</h2>
<p><em>By David Farland at DavidFarland.net</em></p>
<p>In this post David Farland makes an excellent point -- motivation only has to take you so far. And rather than constantly seeking motivation, a better move might be to use the motivation we have when we have it to build better habits. After all, good writing habits will take us to places fleeting motivation never will.</p>
<p>Great insight and an inspiring way of looking at things.</p>

<h2>You Get a Gold Star: Tracking and Motivation</h2>
<p><em>By Steph Snow at BareKnuckleWriter.com</em></p>
<p>After reading this, I felt <em>so </em>less crazy for having not one, but <em>two</em>, packs of those shiny little star stickers in my desk drawer. You know. The ones your elementary school teachers probably stuck on your papers if you didn't completely suck at elementary school things.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm so crazy about reward-style motivation that I even have a <a href="http://www.target.com/p/the-board-dudes-dry-erase-chore-chart-11in-x-14in/-/A-11289335">chore chart</a> (one clearly made for children -- young ones). And instead of those shiny little star stickers, it has the equivalent, but in magnet form. So I can keep re-using them. Oh, and the chore chart is on a whiteboard. #Heaven</p>
<p>I did get hubby to agree to let me create a chore chart for us (we both hate housework about 94% of the time). But he would only agree to an app variety. So no magnetic "stickers" for me. Just another reason I can't wait to have kids!</p>

<h2>Crappy New Year: 5 Failed Writing Resolutions</h2>
<p><em>By Peter Derk at LitReactor.com</em></p>
<p>If you've ever set a writing resolution that was a royal failure, you'll love this post. Derk takes a lighthearted look at some common writing goals, how they can go terribly wrong, and reminds us that it's okay to take a different approach if it suits us. Read it for the laugh, but take away an important message.</p>

<p>Today I released the first podcast episode for 2015 (and sixth overall). In this episode I mostly deal with the topic of revenue streams for writers.</p>
<p>First, I run through eleven blog revenue streams you can use to monetize blogs of your own. Then I tackle a question about e-book revenue (and share a story about my own first e-book, which is scheduled to be covered more in depth on the blog next week).</p>
<p>If you're looking for a way to keep everything organized this year, I also share my new favorite productivity app -- Todoist -- and give you some of the reasons I love it so much.</p>
<p>And one last bit of news in this episode: <a href="http://wordsonpageblog.com">Lori Widmer</a>, fellow freelance writer and good friend, will be my guest co-host in episode 7, set to be posted on January 22nd.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>The New Year is a great time to tackle a new writing challenge. So I've added one to the collection over in the <a title="writing forums" href="http://allindiewriters.com/forums/">All Indie Writers forums</a> -- a 30 day marketing challenge.</p>
<p>The goal of this challenge is to do something to market your writing every day for 30 days. That could mean promoting your freelance writing services. It could mean book marketing. Or it might involve marketing your blog.</p>
<p>Hop over to the <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/forums/section/monthly-writing-challenges/">writing challenges</a> area of the forum if you'd like to take part in this or any other writing challenge. You can start a thread for any of them at any time to share your progress and seek support from the community. No need to wait around for a specific start date or group.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here's a free tracker you can use to map out your 30 day marketing schedule (for the challenge or simply for your own private use).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-29562" src="http://allindiewriters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/echochamber.jpg" alt="echo chamber" width="580" height="290" /></p>
<p>As freelance writers it's not uncommon for us to get information online and even connect with our colleagues that way. And sometimes our circles, or at least the information they expose us to, are more limited than we realize.</p>
<p>It's easy to get caught up in the echo chamber, with the same stale ideas endlessly reinforced. But if you want to stand out and attract the best freelance writing clients, you need to be able to think for yourself. Here are three tips that can help you avoid falling into the echo chamber trap.</p>
<h2>Ignore Cookie Cutter Advice</h2>
<p>This isn't to say you should ignore everything you hear regularly. Business fundamentals apply to all freelancers. So, for example, if all of your close colleagues remind you to have a business plan in place or market your freelance writing services regularly, don't dismiss that.</p>
<p>That said, tools and tactics do <em>not </em>apply to everyone equally. There are countless markets you can target as a freelance writer. Each market is influenced in different ways and by different triggers. Figure out what those are and ask yourself "how can I tailor this to my specific situation?"</p>
<p>For example, most of your colleagues might send email queries whereas your specific clients respond better to cold calls. Or you might be told to blog every day but find that your client base doesn't have time to read that many updates.</p>
<h2>Make Supply and Demand Work for You</h2>
<p>Along those lines, don't rush to follow friends and colleagues to every "gold mine" they say they found for freelance writing gigs. If your fellow writers are all abuzz about a source of freelance leads, leave them to the masses. Go where prospects <em>don't </em>have as many options clamoring for their business.</p>
<p>Instead of joining several freelance bidding sites for example, you might instead join small niche forums where you can build more meaningful relationships with your target clients.</p>
<p>I gave another example of this in relation to traditional writer's market directories. Rather than relying on them alone for prospects to pitch, I suggested that you try <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/quick-tip-use-media-directories-to-find-freelance-writing-clients/">media directories</a> that PR professionals use. Why? Fewer freelance writers know about them, so you have less potential competition. And they can feature tens of thousands of additional leads that aren't included in even the largest writer's market directories.</p>
<h2>Look for Inspiration in Unlikely Places</h2>
<p>Instead of turning to the same old "influencers" in your specialty area for freelance writing advice, broaden your options by learning from other sources.</p>
<p>For example, you might get marketing advice from other types of freelancers. You might seek inspiration from local brick and mortar businesses that you could tailor to your freelance writing career. Or you might even learn from your clients' successes and failures.</p>
<p>How do <em>you </em>keep yourself open to new information from outside the usual echo chamber? What are some of the most unique sources of business advice you've benefitted from so far?</p>

<p>Before the holidays we talked about preparing to take time away from writing or blogging and <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/successful-new-year/">how you can set yourself up for success</a> on your return to work. Well, today is that day for me -- my first work day of 2015. And getting back into the swing of things has been both exciting and challenging</p>
<p>I had a rougher start than I'd like because I didn't sleep last night, at all. Between hubby, the pup, and the wind howling so loudly I thought it would drop a tree or two on the house, sleep just wasn't happening. On the plus side, I got out of bed at 3:00 am -- an entire hour before my target time. I thought getting back to my early schedule would be a bigger challenge. On the downside, I crashed late in the morning for a few hours, so I have no idea what that's going to mean for <em>tonight's </em>sleep schedule. You win some, you lose some.</p>
<p>At this point in the year, I'm basically running on excitement. I get positively giddy about the fresh start of a new year, seeing all of my progress from the year before, and <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new-a-year-end-check-in-and-2015-writing-goals/">making plans to do even bigger things this time around</a>.</p>
<p>If you enjoy that same kind of "New Year's motivation," I'd love to hear how you make the most of it (so leave me a comment and tell me what you're up to!). Here are a few ways I put it to work for me:</p>
<h2>1. Write Blog Posts in Bulk</h2>
<p>A beginning-of-the-year energy surge is the perfect time to write extra blog posts and either schedule them or save them as drafts. Then, when you don't feel like writing something new, you have posts ready and waiting to be published. This works especially well for blogs I only update monthly or bi-weekly. Squeezing in an extra post or two is fairly easy, and it's nice not having to worry about some of those blogs as much later in the month.</p>
<h2>2. Knock Out One "Big" Project</h2>
<p>Or at least I try to focus on something bigger than the daily grind. This year that meant making customizations to a new blog theme on Day One so I'd get a jump on a new site I'm launching. It wasn't a massive project, but it was big enough to be something I might procrastinate about later if I didn't knock it out quickly. That's when the extra enthusiasm really comes in handy.</p>
<h2>3. Read More</h2>
<p>It might sound counter-intuitive to set aside more time for reading rather than "doing" when you have a bit of extra energy and motivation behind you. But give it a try. Pull out some e-books or reports you've been meaning to read. Catch up on blog posts you bookmarked but haven't read yet. (New here? Check out my collection of <a href="http://allindiewriters.com/featured-content/">featured content</a> for a place to start.) There's no time like the present to learn something new. Then you can put your new-found knowledge to work in your writing business.</p>
<p>How are <em>you </em>making the most of the New Year? Is it business as usual? Or do you find January a more productive time than usual?</p>
