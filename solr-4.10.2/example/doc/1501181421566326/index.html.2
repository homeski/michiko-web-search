It&#8217;s doubtful.</p> <p>What about weekends? Sure, right after you catch up on the household chores you put off all week.</p> <p>It&#8217;s tough enough to <a title="How to Stay Sane While Building Your Writing Career Part Time" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/stay-sane-building-writing-career-part-time/" target="_blank">build your writing career part-time</a> around other commitments, but it&#8217;s especially difficult if you have a day job.</p> <p>Fortunately, not all jobs are equal. In fact, <b>some types of work leave you ample time to write</b>: jobs where you can write while on the clock, positions with limited days or hours, and gigs where you control when and how much you work.</p> <h2><b>Jobs that let you write at work</b></h2> <p>I used to drive an electric tram for residents of a wealthy community in Florida, and my employer encouraged me to bring books or even a laptop if I wanted to read or write during slow times. And sure enough, during the off-season, I often waited for an hour or more between passengers.</p> <p>Few employers may allow you to write while on the job, but if you&#8217;re serious about your writing and need a day job, try one of these positions:</p> <p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Security guard</span></b><br> &#8220;I wrote <a title="Enjoy the Decline: Accepting and Living with the Death of the United States" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/1480284769/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1480284769&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=CRFG2E6I23YGRXE4" target="_blank"><i>Enjoy the Decline</i></a> in 45 days while pulling 16 hour shifts sitting at a warehouse as a security guard,&#8221; says author <a title="Why You Should Aspire to be a Security Guard" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~captaincapitalism.blogspot.com/2013/05/why-you-should-aspire-to-be-security.html" target="_blank">Aaron Clarey</a>. He also wrote his 324-page book, <i>Behind the Housing Crash</i>, while working at that same job.</p> <p>Clarey suggests writers ask to be assigned night shifts, when they’ll likely have fewer administrative than they would during the day. However, day shifts can be productive as well; author <a title="Lee Thompson Fiction" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.leethompsonfiction.com/?p=43" target="_blank">Mark Allan Gunnells says</a>:</p> <blockquote><p><i>I’m a security guard, and have pockets of downtime throughout the day. I have trained myself to write in those pockets. It isn’t ideal for some, the constant stop-and-start method, but I’ve managed to make it work.</i></p></blockquote> <p>When I wrote while working as a security guard, the biggest problem I faced was the number of interruptions. Gunnells may have adapted to that stop-and-start environment, but my own solution was to <b>do the preparatory work instead of the actual writing</b>.</p> <p>For example, I researched my topic online, found sources and took notes. When I later wrote my articles, they came quickly and easily since I already had information, sources and a general outline ready.</p> <p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pet sitter or House sitter</span></b><br> While they may not be full-time gigs, these jobs leave you lots of time to write.</p> <p>When I was younger, I wrote while getting paid to watch dogs for family and friends. When my wife and I travel, we pay our pet sitter $60 per night to stay with our two cats. Apart from a few minutes of play time and feeding, the rest of her eight-hour stay is open for whatever she wants to do &#8212; including writing.</p> <p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other possibilities</span></b><br> Consider alternative positions that offer lots of downtime during your working hours, and don’t be afraid to get creative. For example:</p> <ul> <li>A late-shift hotel clerk can write while waiting for the phone to ring or a guest to check in</li> <li>An elder-care driver can write while waiting for passengers at appointments</li> <li>A campground host can write when he’s not welcoming guests or accepting bookings</li> <li>A baby sitter can write after the kids are in bed</li> </ul> <p>It may not be easy to fit in writing time at work, but it’s possible. <a title="How I Wrote a Novel at Work" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.huffingtonpost.com/rodrigo-ribera-debre/how-i-wrote-a-novel-at-wo_b_5492799.html" target="_blank">Rodrigo Ribera D&#8217;Ebre says</a> he wrote a novel during breaks while working in an office cubicle at an auto insurance company. Short story author <a title="#4 How you knew you wanted to be a writer" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~lisaprocterwriting.wordpress.com/2013/08/20/a-childhood-dream/" target="_blank">Lisa Proctor says</a> her boss let her write on the job when she was a clerk at a bookshop.</p> <p>Some employers are happy to let writers write, as long as they get their work done. Why not ask?</p> <h2><b>Part-time work that pays well</b></h2> <p>A miserable day job can be good motivation for <a title="How Your Miserable Day Job Can Help Launch Your Freelance Career" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/launch-your-freelance-career/" target="_blank">launching your writing career</a>, and you might even use lunch breaks to plan how you&#8217;ll <a title="Quitting Your Job to Freelance? How to Keep the Law on Your Side" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/quit-job-to-freelance-legal/" target="_blank">quit your job</a> and start freelancing.</p> <p>But if you need the extra income, consider a part-time job to support your writing. <b>To maximize your writing time, look for a position that pays well for your time, so you can afford to work fewer hours.</b></p> <p>If you only want to work a couple of days each week, one of the best opportunities may be bartending. If you have previous experience serving drinks or waiting tables, you might convince a bar or club owner to let you work only Friday and Saturday nights &#8212; the busiest times for most bars.</p> <p>The tips can be surprisingly good. “<b>Tending bar at a busy nightclub, I regularly pulled in upwards of three hundred dollars a night, and on many Fridays I took in more than $600,</b>” says <a title="How Much Do Bartenders Make?" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.breakintobartending.com/how-much-do-bartenders-make/" target="_blank">Rob Doherty</a>. On his best night, he earned $1,600, and that was at a rural tavern where he normally made only about $100 per night. However, he warns that without experience you&#8217;ll probably get the slow shifts to start, and you&#8217;ll make much less.</p> <p>Also consider jobs that require you to work five days or more each week, but for a limited number of hours. For example, many people who deliver newspapers to the coin-operated boxes on street corners (a job I used to have), work just two to four hours each morning. Just be prepared to get up at three or four in the morning each day!</p> <p>Here are some other part-time possibilities with the potential for decent hourly incomes:</p> <ul> <li>Waiting tables in an expensive restaurant</li> <li>Cutting hair</li> <li>Substitute teaching</li> <li>Doing morning janitorial work for offices or schools</li> <li>Driving a school bus</li> </ul> <p>As a school bus driver, you can use the time between morning and afternoon runs to write, and you get summers off.</p> <h2><b>Flexible, writing-friendly jobs</b></h2> <p>The best gig for writers would allow you to work when you want and as much or as little as you want. That way, when you have paid writing projects you can slack off on the other work, and when writing income falls you have a backup. But is there such a job?</p> <p>Yes. <b>As a search engine evaluator &#8212; a job I started nine months ago &#8212; I work when I want, day or night, for $13.50 per hour. </b>The most I&#8217;ve worked is 53 hours in a month, and although the company says you have to work at least 20 hours, I have recently dropped to fewer than five hours monthly, which is apparently just enough to keep from getting fired.</p> <p>As a search engine evaluator, you rate search results based on various factors. The employers provide the minimal training necessary. Companies that hire for these positions include <a title="Leapforce at Home " href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://www.leapforceathome.com/qrp/public/jobs/list?uref=c2920371a4c8a8fa002e8cac85190f94" target="_blank">Leapforce</a>, <a title="The Smart Crowd" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.thesmartcrowd.com/workers/" target="_blank">Lionbridge</a> and <a title="Appen" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.appen.com/joinus/freelance-work/" target="_blank">Appen Butler Hill</a>, and may also offer other at-home part-time positions.</p> <p>Jobs that let you work as many hours as you like, whenever you like, are rare. Get creative to brainstorm opportunities based on your skills. Perhaps a family member with a business can hire you to work the days and hours that fit best with your writing schedule &#8212; another way I’ve been able to work while having time to write.</p> <p><b>Do you have a job that leaves you time to write?

Often, I go hours without speaking to anyone. I work with more than 30 writers whom I’ve never met, yet I feel as if I know them.</p> <p>On paper, the writers I work with have nothing in common. One’s a stay-at-home mom, another’s a whistleblower, and a third is a full-time backpacker who uses freelancing income to <a title="Live Anywhere as a Freelance Writer: How to Create a Location-Independent Career" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/freelance-writer-location-independent-career/" target="_blank">travel the world</a>. But <b>the quality of their writing binds them all together.</b></p> <p>After reading hundreds of articles from prospective writers, I’ve realized that there are a few things I look for every time:</p> <h2><b>1. A distinct voice</b></h2> <p><b>A unique voice is the number one thing that makes me scoot to the edge of my chair when I’m reading an article.</b> I feel like I know my writers because their voices tell me about their personalities, what they find funny, how empathetic they are, and how much they love what they do.</p> <p>I wish I knew how to teach voice, but it’s not something you can force. You can read the greats and try to absorb their style, but the best you can hope for is a convincing imitation. A writer can only <a title="5 Ways to Add Personality and Voice to Every Blog Post You Write" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/add-personality-and-voice-to-blog-posts/" target="_blank">develop her own voice</a> through experience.</p> <h2><b>2.</b><b>  </b><b>Personality that leaps off the page</b></h2> <p>My all-time favorite writers are those who make me want to read snippets of their articles out loud in the office to anyone who will listen. A writer with an infectious personality produces articles that demand to be read because they’re so entertaining. <b>And if you’ve got my attention, you’re probably going to get the job.</b></p> <p>While it’s not appropriate for every article, I’m a sucker for <a title="Pitching a Guest Post? 7 Ways to Stand Out in an Editor’s Inbox" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/pitching-guest-posts/" target="_blank">witty pop culture references</a> or masterful sarcasm. I once had a writer who sent me an article called “5 Ways to Run Your Startup Into the Ground.” It was fantastic because it presented actual advice by showing what <i>not </i>to do.</p> <h2><b>3.</b><b>  </b><b>Clear, unpretentious prose</b></h2> <p>This may earn a few gasps of outrage from the literary community, but nothing turns me off more quickly than <a title="Self-Editing Basics: 10 Simple Ways to Edit Your Own Book" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/self-editing-basics/" target="_blank">flowery language</a>. Some of the most overused $5 words I see include “plethora,” “germane,” and “onus.” (We keep a running list of most-hated words on the office whiteboard.)</p> <p><b>When writing for the web, it’s better to be understood than admired for an extensive vocabulary.</b></p> <h2><b>4.</b><b>  </b><b>An “ear” for syntax</b></h2> <p>Good writing doesn’t leave you looking for the seams; it makes you forget you’re reading altogether. A piece of writing should “sound” good in your head and feel like a one-on-one conversation with the writer.</p> <h2><b>5.</b><b>  </b><b>Cliché-free expression</b></h2> <p>George Orwell once <a title="George Orwell's 5 Rules for Effective Writing" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.pickthebrain.com/blog/george-orwells-5-rules-for-effective-writing/" target="_blank">wrote a list of rules</a> for effective writing, and my favorite is, <b>“Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.”</b></p> <p>Any writer who tells me to “think outside the box,” “jump on the bandwagon” or “get more bang for my buck” is going to get my darkest Grumpy Cat scowl.</p> <h2><b>6.</b><b>  </b><b>Knowledge of AP style</b></h2> <p>I won’t ever write someone off if he doesn’t stick to AP style, but at least a basic knowledge of style is a major plus. Most of our editors were <a title="5 Lessons From J-School That Will Make You a Better Writer" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/5-lessons-j-school-will-make-better-writer/" target="_blank">trained as journalists</a>, and most of the publications we work with favor AP over Chicago style. Regardless of which style you use, consistency and readability are key.</p> <h2><b>7.</b><b>  </b><b>Deep expertise in a specific industry</b></h2> <p>Again, this is more of a “nice to have” trait than a requirement, but writers with a lot of knowledge about healthcare, tech, entrepreneurship or digital marketing are extremely valuable additions to our freelance roster.</p> <p>Right now, there’s a <a title="6 Ways to Land Better Freelance Writing Jobs and Make More Money" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/land-better-freelance-writing-jobs/" target="_blank">big demand</a> for writers who know the ins and outs of the Affordable Care Act, encryption, cloud technology, the Internet of Things, lean and agile methods, content marketing, social media and affiliate marketing. <b>I pay special attention to writers who send links to articles they’ve written on specific topics relevant to their expertise.</b></p> <h2><b>8.</b><b>  </b><b>The ability to follow directions</b></h2> <p>Because we work with 700+ publications, the ability to <a title="How to Land Your Next Freelance Writing Job" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/land-your-next-freelance-writing-job/" target="_blank">follow directions</a> is crucial. I’ve found that writers who can’t rein themselves in on word count or stay on topic are always difficult to work with.</p> <p><b>Of course, writing is incredibly subjective, and as a freelancer, trying to appeal to every client or editor’s sensibilities can be frustrating.</b> It doesn’t help that what supposedly “works” for online content is constantly in flux. Some editors only publish listicles, while others won’t publish any. Some publications insist their readers won’t read anything over 500 words, while others are starved for long-form content.</p> <p>Call me optimistic, but I truly believe that readers know what’s good &#8212; even if they can’t articulate it &#8212; and that the thirst for fantastic writing isn’t going anywhere. Now more than ever, there’s a demand for writers who can inform, entertain and create a one-on-one connection with readers. I’m out there looking for them, and I know other editors are, too.</p> <p><b>How do you highlight these traits when you pitch an editor?</b></p> <span id="pty_trigger"></span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/what-editors-look-for-freelance-writers/">What Editors Look for in Freelance Writers: 8 Ways to Impress</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com">The Write Life</a>.</p> <Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" alt="" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0" hspace="0" src="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/83301918/0/thewritelife">]]><![CDATA[<div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a title="Like on Facebook" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/83301918/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Share on Google+" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/83301918/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Pin it!" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/83301918/thewritelife,"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Tweet This" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/83301918/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Subscribe by RSS" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/83301918/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;</div>]]></content:encoded> 			<wfw:commentRss>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/83301918/0/thewritelife~What-Editors-Look-for-in-Freelance-Writers-Ways-to-Impress/feed/</wfw:commentRss> 		<slash:comments>11</slash:comments></item><item><feedburner:origLink>http://thewritelife.com/tracking-freelance-earnings/</feedburner:origLink> 		<title>Tracking Freelance Earnings: A New Monthly Column From Nicole Dieker</title> 		<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/83149343/0/thewritelife~Tracking-Freelance-Earnings-A-New-Monthly-Column-From-Nicole-Dieker/</link> 		<comments>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/83149343/0/thewritelife~Tracking-Freelance-Earnings-A-New-Monthly-Column-From-Nicole-Dieker/#comments</comments> 		<pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2015 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate> 		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Nicole Dieker]]></dc:creator> 				<category><![CDATA[Freelancing]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[blogging]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[clients]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[finances]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[freelancing]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[increase your rates]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[writing jobs]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[writing life]]></category> 		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://thewritelife.com/?p=4390</guid> 		<description><![CDATA[<p>Curious what a freelance writer's income really looks like?

My name is Nicole and I’m a full-time blogger and copywriter. This year, we’re going to take a monthly look at how much money I earn as a freelancer.</p> <p>I first began full-time freelancing in May 2012, as an independent musician and singer-songwriter. In July 2012, I started posting my weekly freelance earnings to <a title="Hello, The Future" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~hello-the-future.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">my Tumblr</a>. I started publicly sharing my income because I wanted to start a conversation about how much musicians actually make. That first week I posted my income, for example, I played two shows but only earned $141. Not great, right?</p> <p>By the end of 2012, I was pretty certain I couldn’t make a livable wage just as a singer-songwriter. I decided to see if I could pick up a few writing jobs to earn extra cash between gigs. Like <a title="How I Became a Freelance Writer — and 7 Tips on How You Can Do It, Too" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.makealivingwriting.com/how-i-got-started-as-a-freelance-writer-the-first-time/" target="_blank">the great Carol Tice</a>, who was also a songwriter in Los Angeles before she transitioned into writing, I quickly learned that I loved the freelance writing life &#8212; and that I could earn a lot more money as a writer than I ever could as a musician.</p> <h2><b>Tracking my freelance writing income</b></h2> <p>So I kept tracking my income, week by week, and watching the numbers get bigger and bigger. I wrote for content mills, then entry-level copy agencies, and then I started to build my own portfolio of writing clients.</p> <p>Now I have regular bylines on sites like <a title="The Penny Hoarder" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.thepennyhoarder.com/author/nicoledieker/" target="_blank">The Penny Hoarder</a>, <a title="The Billfold" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thebillfold.com/user/5309/nicole-dieker" target="_blank">The Billfold</a>, <a title="Boing Boing" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~boingboing.net/author/nicoledieker" target="_blank">Boing Boing</a> and <a title="The Freelancer" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~contently.net/category/ask-freelancer/" target="_blank">The Freelancer</a>, and make most of my income as a professional blogger with the occasional copywriting job. (I still play about one gig a month as a musician, too &#8212; can’t give it up!)</p> <p><b>Every month, I’m going to check in with all of you at The Write Life with a report of my previous month’s freelance earnings.</b> I’ll write about how much work I was able to bill for the month, how many pieces I wrote, and share a little bit about how the month went for me, finance-wise. Let me know what you’re interested in discussing, and I can write specific columns about sending and tracking <a title="The Best Invoicing Systems for Freelancers: A Writer Tries 10 Popular Options" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/best-invoicing-systems-freelancers-writer-tries-10-popular-options/" target="_blank">invoices</a>, making budgets on a variable income, and other financial aspects of the freelance life.</p> <p>I love writing about money, and I promise I will share all the important details with you &#8212; down to the penny.</p> <h2><b>2014 Earnings and 2015 Goals</b></h2> <p>Here’s what you need to know to start out: I just finished totaling up my 2014 numbers, as I recorded on <a title="The Billfold: The Art of Freelance Writing" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thebillfold.com/slug/the-art-of-freelance-writing/" target="_blank">The Billfold</a>. In 2014, I earned <b>$40,966.48 </b>as a freelance writer and <b>$2,492.54</b> as a musician, for a grand total of <b>$43,059.02.</b></p> <p>At the beginning of 2014, I was making most of my money through 3-cents-a-word content sites. I really wanted to expand my portfolio (and my income), so I set myself the goal of pitching one new blog, publication or copywriting client every week. A lot of my pitches were successful, and I began building my portfolio and adding new clients to my roster.</p> <p><b>I also learned that this type of success starts to snowball:</b> once you get a byline in a high-profile publication, other editors start contacting you to ask if you’re interested in working for them, too.</p> <p>By the end of 2014, I was earning most of my income writing articles for various publications and blogs. Instead of 3 cents a word, I often get between $150 and $300 a piece. I still do some copywriting work, too &#8212; as I wrote in one of my recent <a title="Ask A Freelancer" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~contently.net/2014/11/18/ask-freelancer/ask-freelancer-will-still-freelancing-10-years/" target="_blank">Ask A Freelancer</a> columns, it’s important to diversify your income with different types of writing. I don’t know what the blog landscape will look like in 10 years, but I do know businesses will probably still need copywriters, so I want to make sure I stay active in both fields.</p> <p>This year, I want to see how far I can take my monthly earnings. I’m earning around $4,500 a month now, and I’d like to push it to at least $5,000 a month by summer 2015. <strong>If I average $5,000 per month over 2015, I’ll earn $60,000 for the year</strong>, which would be incredible.</p> <p>To get that extra $500 every month, I’ll need at least one more really solid client. Or, I could increase my income by <a title="How to Confidently Set and Raise Your Freelance Writing Rates" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/set-and-raise-freelance-writing-rates/" target="_blank">re-negotiating rates</a> with my current clients. I’ll also need to figure out how to re-allocate my time, since I already have a pretty heavy writing load: each week, I turn in around 20 individual articles to various publications.</p> <p>Will I earn that $60,000? Will I get that new client? Stick with this column, and we’ll find out what happens together. See you back here in early February!</p> <p><b>What subjects would you like to see Nicole cover in her monthly freelance earnings column?

She blogs at <a title="A Writer's Bucket List" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.writersbucketlist.com/" target="_blank">A Writer&#8217;s Bucket List</a> and co-hosts the <a title="This Is Temporary" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/this-is-temporary/id918266127" target="_blank">This Is Temporary</a> podcast.</p> <p><b>Price:</b> $45. The course comes with lifetime access and a 30-day money-back guarantee.</p> <p><b>Who It’s For: </b>Anyone who wants to write a nonfiction, message-driven ebook (or, as Sitar calls it, a manifesto). It’s a perfect fit for people who know they want to write an ebook, but aren’t sure what they want to say or how to get started.</p> <p><b>What It Will Help You Do: </b>This course will walk you through each step of writing your ebook &#8212; everything from carving out the time to write to defining your audience and finding your voice.</p> <p><b>What’s Included: </b>An online course with 10 modules:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Commit to Your Writing Routine:</strong> How can you fit writing into your life?</li> <li><b>Clarify Your Message:</b> What do you want to be known for? What do you have to offer?</li> <li><b>Define Your Audience: </b>Who are you writing for?</li> <li><b>Describe Your Offer: </b>How are you going to solve problems for your readers?</li> <li><b>Determine Your Action Steps: </b>What actions do you want your readers to take?</li> <li><b>Create Your Outline: </b>What is your book going to say?</li> <li><b>Know Your Unique Voice:</b> What is your genuine voice?</li> <li><b>Consider the FAQs:</b> What questions will your readers have?</li> <li><b>Write!:</b> Finish your first draft!</li> <li><b>Review What You’ve Written:</b> Who can you ask for feedback?</li> </ol> <p>Each module is further segmented into information and tips, writing prompts, worksheets and assignments. Some modules have an “additional resources” section with helpful links for further reading.</p> <p><b>The Best Part:</b> This course breaks down the monumental task of writing an ebook into bite-sized chunks. The truth is that you probably don’t need help with the writing itself; you need help figuring out <i>what</i> to write, <i>who</i> to write it for and <i>how</i> to manage your time.</p> <p>That’s where this course comes in. Sitar helps you determine your message and your offer through helpful writing prompts, questions and exercises. As shown above, you don’t even start writing an outline until Module 6 &#8212; and you don’t start drafting until Module 9. To top it off, she even includes an ebook publishing timeline for spreading your message to the world.</p> <p><b>What Would Make It Even Better: </b>There’s a private Google+ group for people taking the course, but it isn’t active. As evidenced by events like #NaNoWriMo, writers thrive when they have a support network, so a lively Google+ community would give this course a huge boost. Almost all of the assignments are “community challenges” that encourage you to post in the group, but without anyone else posting there, it’s a bit intimidating.</p> <p><b>Our Recommendation: </b>The hardest part of writing is starting, which is why this course is worth the money. It guides you through every step of the creation process, making completing an ebook much more manageable.

Build a swipe file</b></h2> <p>A swipe file is a great tool for writers. It’s a place for recording facts, figures, sentences and ideas about your work. If this information isn’t relevant to your current writing project, it will help you the next time you’re devoid of ideas. All you have to do is review your swipe file, pull out your notes and use them as a jumping off point into the unknown.</p> <p>If you’re a copywriter, clip the <a title="How to Write Blog Post Headlines Readers Want to Click On" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/write-blog-post-headlines/" target="_blank">headlines</a>, words and sales hooks of other, more talented copywriters into your file.</p> <p>If you’re a nonfiction writer, store articles and notes about<a title="5 Clever Hacks for Researching That Will Help You Write Better Stories" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/5-clever-hacks-for-researching-that-will-help-you-write-better-stories-needs-link-to-twitter-lists/" target="_blank"> your research</a> in your file.</p> <p>If you’re a blogger, clip the most popular articles by bloggers in your niche and review these before you write your next post.</p> <p>If you’re a fiction writer, keep reflections about stories you read and ideas for future work in your swipe file.</p> <p><a title="Take Charge of Evernote With These 9 Great Tips and Tricks" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.becomeawritertoday.com/nine-great-uses-evernote/" target="_blank">I use Evernote</a> for my swipe file. Other digital options include OneNote and Simplenote, both of which are multi-platform tools. However, you don’t need a digital tool to keep a swipe file. Author Ryan Holiday, for example, uses a <a title="How And Why To Keep A “Commonplace Book”" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/08/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/" target="_blank">paper-based system</a> for his research. In the end, <b>the tool is less important than the process.</b></p> <h2><b>2. Practice writing by keeping a journal</b></h2> <p>Writing a journal will foster your creativity and give you space to develop ideas that you don’t have room for elsewhere. <a title="Struggling with Writer’s Block? Unleash Your Creativity with This Strategy" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/writers-block-creativity-strategy/" target="_blank">Journaling</a> can help you turn thoughts and feelings into words and ideas.</p> <p>Because it’s private, you’re less likely to censor yourself. This brutal honesty will expand the boundaries of your writing and if you keep a journal for several years, older journal entries serve as markers for your progress.</p> <p>Virginia Woolf was fastidious about keeping a journal or diary. In an entry from 1924 in <a title="A Writer's Diary by Virginia Woolf " href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156027917/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0156027917&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=BC7PVHZD6O3CAR26" target="_blank"><i>A Writer’s Diary</i></a>, she describes how journal writing gave her more ideas for fiction and nonfiction.</p> <blockquote><p><i>Why not write about it? Truthfully? As I think, the diary writing has greatly helped my style; loosened the ligatures.</i></p></blockquote> <p>My life isn’t much like Woolf’s, but I learned a lot about the art of journal writing from her. Keeping a journal doesn’t mean recording a daily summary of one’s life. Rather, it’s a way to expose your thoughts and feelings. This self-reflective writing will help you dig deeper into your thought processes.</p> <p>At the very least, journal writing is another form of practice, and disciplined practice is essential if you want to become a better writer.</p> <h2><b>3. Record your experiences in a sense diary</b></h2> <p>Keeping a sense diary is a useful practice for creative writers. In it, record one sensual experience per day, like how a meal tasted or what a person’s voice sounded like. Take notice of the stickiness of sweet tea, the coarseness of an unvarnished floor and the pain behind your eyes when you’re tired.</p> <p><b>The world is your source material.</b></p> <p>Now, see if you can remix your sense diary to describe how a smell tastes or what a sound looks like. No matter what type of writer you are, invoking at least one of the five senses will add character and authenticity to your work.</p> <p>It’s common practice for creative writers to remix and play on our perceptions of the five senses. In 1962, Vladimir Nabokov, author of <a title="Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov " href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679723161/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0679723161&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=OMFET5KE7IPYPC74" target="_blank"><i>Lolita</i></a>, <a title="Nabokov's interview" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~lib.ru/NABOKOW/Inter02.txt" target="_blank">told the BBC</a> he could hear colors in different languages. He explained how he used this ability to great effect in his writing:</p> <blockquote><p><i>The long ‘a’ of the English alphabet has for me the tint of weathered wood, but a French ‘a’ evokes polished ebony.</i></p></blockquote> <p>Keep a sense diary in a paper notebook, in a password-protected file on your computer or by using one of the many journal apps available for smartphones. <a title="Day One App" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~dayoneapp.com/" target="_blank">Day One</a> for iOS is particularly popular, and it supports multimedia content, which is useful for adding context to your descriptions.</p> <p>Creative writers who get into the habit of keeping a sense diary will find it’s more natural to describe the clack of an old keyboard or the spot of blue ink on the inside of their index fingers if they’re in the habit of recording these observations anyway.</p> <p>Nonfiction writers can use a sense diary too. Legendary copywriter and ad-man <a title="Ogilvy &amp; Mather " href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.ogilvy.com/about/our-history/ogilvy_mather.aspx" target="_blank">David Ogilvy</a> regularly drew on the five senses, and he famously wrote about the Rolls-Royce: “At 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock.”</p> <p><b>Still feeling stuck?</b></p> <p>The American short story writer and author John Updike wasn’t one for waiting around for inspiration. Updike published his first work, a collection of poetry called <a title="The Carpentered Hen by John Updike" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394523946/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0394523946&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=XERQILTGFA6R3BWR" target="_blank"><i>The Carpentered Hen</i></a>, in 1958. Throughout his life, he wrote for several hours day, and he published a book almost every year. He said:</p> <blockquote><p><i>I’ve never believed that one should wait until one is inspired, because I think that the pleasures of not writing are so great that if you ever start indulging them, you’ll never write again.</i></p></blockquote> <p><b>The pleasures of </b><b><i>not writing</i></b><b> are great; don’t succumb to them.</b> Force yourself into the chair and update your swipe file, your journal or your sense diary. On difficult days, these methods will serve as prompts that help you write. And on good days, they will support your best work.</p> <hr /><p><em>The pleasures of not writing are great; don’t succumb to them, says @BryanJCollins</em><br><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+pleasures+of+not+writing+are+great%3B+don%E2%80%99t+succumb+to+them%2C+says+%40BryanJCollins&via=thewritelife&related=thewritelife&url=http://thewritelife.com/dont-wait-for-inspiration-beat-writers-block/' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'>Click To Tweet</a><br><hr /> <p>Somedays I consider it enough to simply write in a journal or make observations in my swipe file, while on other days I concentrate on reaching a <a title="Write Every Day: How to Meet Your Daily Writing Goals" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/daily-writing-goals/" target="_blank">target word count</a> or finishing a project. If you’re unsure, remember this simple rule:</p> <p><i>Do the work.</i></p> <p>The first few sentences may not make much sense but, several sentences in, you’ll realize you’re not as tired or devoid of ideas as you thought; you were just procrastinating.</p> <p><b>Do you rely on moments of inspiration?

But getting your byline into popular travel magazines and on travel blogs isn’t easy, in part because there’s so much competition.</p> <p>Here’s what will help you break into the travel sector: writing a great feature. To accomplish that, let’s talk about how to best pull the reader into your travel story, so the next editor you pitch is eager to publish your work.</p> <h2><b>How to write a great feature </b></h2> <p>A feature is typically a long-form piece that runs anywhere from 1,500 to 3,000 words and covers a destination in depth. An article might profile a well-known cultural event with a new twist, or it may be a personal essay about an experience in a foreign country. Some magazines that publish feature articles are National Geographic Traveler or Conde Nast Traveler.</p> <p>Feature writing is an examination of “otherness” &#8212; the where, when, who, why and what of a destination. While you can achieve this examination in several ways, <b>good feature writing should compel the reader to consider traveling</b>, or at least entice them to fantasize about it.</p> <p>Why don’t we review an example. In 2012, I landed in the city of Seville, the seat of Andalusian culture, to experience what that region is mainly famous for: flamenco dancing. Sitting down at a tavern to experience this aspect of southern Spain sounds ridiculously easy to describe.</p> <h3><b>Example #1</b></h3> <p><i>The flamenco dancer wore a red dress. I couldn’t keep up with her feet moving so quickly. The guitar player often played fast and then slow, which made the dancing exciting. </i></p> <p><i>She was a beautiful woman and I could see intensity on her face whenever her feet hit the floor in fast movements. The guitar player dictated how she moved and what she did through the pace of the music. It made my heart beat rapidly along with her. Patrons shouted “ole”, at times, clapping their hands as she performed. I joined in as well.</i></p> <p><i>La </i><i>Carboneria is a famous bar in Seville that looks like a garage during the day. Once night hits, it becomes kind of a cave, a darkened space with a piano. Flamenco is offered free, starting at 11:00 p.m. A glass of sangria only costs two euros. This bar is legendary, known for recreating gypsy culture.</i></p> <p>Falling asleep yet? Me, too. As you noticed, the writing is almost clinical. It tells a story, but not one that is engaging, let alone interesting. Let’s try this piece again.</p> <h3><b>Example #2</b></h3> <p><i>Her feet moved so rapidly my eyes couldn&#8217;t maintain contact. </i></p> <p><i>Then her skirts moved, flying in a circle and finally resting when the Spanish guitar player segued into a mellower chord. </i></p> <p><i>The woman&#8217;s proud nose and fluttering eyelashes were a comely frame for the fiery red of her dress, form-fitting and flaring to the bottom with ruffles trailing to the scuffed floor. Her feet were encased in shoes with delicate straps and short, thick one-inch heels. How petite they were, so incongruous to her ecstatic, impassioned movements.</i></p> <p><i>Her arms formed a diamond shape above her head, the silhouette strong and muscular, for she was waiting for the guitar to wail again. When it came, she moved with purpose. Her feet hitting against the floor, scuffing it more. Her face a mask of concentration as she enacted the music through the wood connecting to her heels. A slam from her feet punctuated each note, we clapped. Slam again, we yelled “ole”. </i><i>This is the core of flamenco; the dance of the free, the thief, and the heavy-hearted.</i></p> <p><i>The</i><i> baile</i><i> of the gypsies is well known in Seville and many pour into the famous La Carboneria, </i><i>a cavernous bar with a beautiful, worn piano, that swells to capacity while sangria flows at two euros a glass.</i></p> <p>Example #2 accomplishes two goals. First, it draws in the reader towards the <a title="Horror Authors: How to Scare the Heck Out of Your Readers" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/scary-writing/" target="_blank">action</a>. What if someone reading this has never seen a live performance of flamenco dancing before, and they are wondering what it’s like?<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p> <p>Second, the content sets a strong image of place. <b>Make it easy for your readers to metaphorically step into that sense of “otherness” I mentioned earlier.</b> If you make it difficult or worse, boring, a reader’s attention span will trail off and they will move onto something else more engaging.</p> <h2><b>Make your travel writing pop</b></h2> <p>How do you stop being a dull travel writer and make your features sizzle with action and vigor?</p> <p><b>A feature writer for a travel magazine or say, for your own blog, is in the business of selling one thing and one thing only: fantasy.</b> The fantasy of travel involves &#8212; drawing the reader in and keeping them by painting a sense of place.</p> <p>Once you land in that exotic country, you become the observer. It’s your duty to record details that could be included in your story. No detail is frivolous when incorporated well and in sync with the rest of the piece.</p> <p><b>Make sure you have a central focus for your piece.</b> Perhaps it’s an event that has an impact on tourism or the local population. Maybe it’s exploring a mythical cultural ritual. Could be the geopolitical implications of a destination. It’s clear that the flamenco piece is attempting to disseminate gypsy culture through this popular dance.</p> <p>Now that you’ve traveled to the destination and you’ve recorded the details, remember to <b>incorporate vivid verbs as you write</b>. The right combination of words will fill in the visuals and make that travel experience three dimensional. This doesn’t mean using excessive adverbs or adjectives; well-placed verbs will make your text succinct, yet strong.</p> <p>Travel magazines serve many functions &#8212; sometimes the text is informational, offering tips or the latest travel trends, or sometimes an article seduces the reader with a faraway place, different than her home.</p> <p>If you want to be the latter type of writer, remember that vivid writing opens up the imagination, allowing the reader to picture a destination and what it could symbolize for them.</p> <p><b>Do you write travel articles?

Suddenly, your goal will go from being a far-off dream to a resolution within reach.</p> <p>But what will you resolve to do? With the new year approaching, let’s take a look at some resolutions that will help your writing career grow in the months ahead.</p> <h2><b>1. Get better rates and better clients</b></h2> <p>Writing isn’t like other careers; you can’t expect an annual performance review and raise every year. <b>If you want to earn more money, you need to ask for it.</b></p> <hr /><p><em>If you want to earn more money, you need to ask for it, says @HelloTheFuture</em><br><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=If+you+want+to+earn+more+money%2C+you+need+to+ask+for+it%2C+says+%40HelloTheFuture&via=thewritelife&related=thewritelife&url=http://thewritelife.com/new-years-resolutions-for-writers/' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'>Click To Tweet</a><br><hr /> <p>That’s why one of my New Year’s writing resolutions is to renegotiate my rates with my best clients. I just finished a <a title="How Sheryl Sandberg’s Advice Could Help Freelancers Land More Clients" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/sheryl-sandbergs-advice-help-freelancers-land-clients/" target="_blank">negotiation</a> &#8212; look at me getting ahead on my resolutions! &#8212; and it was much less scary than I thought it would be.</p> <p>Negotiating can be hard, so if you’re looking for tips to help you navigate the process, check out Tom Ewer’s <a title="A Low Risk, 3-Step Plan for Raising Your Freelancing Rates" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/a-low-risk-3-step-plan-for-raising-your-freelancing-rates/" target="_blank">low-risk, three-step plan</a> to negotiate and raise your rates.</p> <p><b>Sometimes you can’t negotiate a client up to <a title="Freelance Writing Rates: 5 Resources for Figuring Out How Much to Charge" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/freelance-writing-rates-resources" target="_blank">the rate</a> that you deserve.</b> That means it might be time to seek out a <a title="A Step-by-Step Guide for Going After Clients You Really Want" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/going-after-clients-you-really-want/" target="_blank">new client</a> willing to pay the rate you consider corresponds to your increased experience. My other big New Year’s writing resolution is to find a new high-paying client and consider letting go of one of my lower-paying clients.</p> <h2><b>2. Start your dream project</b></h2> <p>We all begin our writing careers with big dreams of what we hope to accomplish, right? Why not turn those dreams into resolutions?</p> <p>Here’s a 2015 resolution from <a title="Sara Brady" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.sarabrady.com/" target="_blank">Sara Brady</a>, a writer, copywriter and editor who’s written for <i>Time Out New York</i> and <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>:</p> <blockquote><p><em>I&#8217;ve had an idea for a novel kicking about in my head for several years, resurfacing occasionally. I have a skeleton of an outline. But that&#8217;s it. So in 2015 I&#8217;m going to write it down. If only to get it out of my head.</em></p></blockquote> <p>What about you? Is this year going to be the year you write your novel, or your screenplay, or try to get a piece in <i>The New Yorker?</i> Make the resolution, and you’re one step closer to making it happen.</p> <h2><b>3. Improve your workflow</b></h2> <p>A lot of us know we don’t work as effectively as we could. If you spend more time answering emails than writing, or if you find yourself procrastinating on your writing gigs and then losing sleep to complete them, it’s time to resolve to improve your workflow.</p> <p><a title="Meaghan O'Connell " href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~meaghano.com/" target="_blank">Meaghan O’Connell</a>, former associate editor of <i>The Billfold </i>and current contributor to <i>The Cut</i>, writes:</p> <blockquote><p><i>I have long-harbored this fantasy of doing an hour of intense writing before I even open my email in the morning. I have yet to do it. Nothing in my life is so pressing that it can&#8217;t wait an hour, and I know I&#8217;d do better work without thinking about all of the little admin tasks I need to get to.</i></p> <p><i>It&#8217;s so easy to avoid diving into the hard work of making things up. I am avoiding it right now!! Next year, I vow to get rid of this stupid, self-punishing tic. You&#8217;ll know I did it when you see a dozen novels, written by me, shoot to the top of the bestseller list.”</i></p></blockquote> <p><b>The way to make this type of resolution successful is to be specific.</b> Don’t resolve to “procrastinate less;” resolve to set a timer for 20 minutes and work until the timer stops. Or borrow Meaghan’s resolution and spend the first hour of your workday writing. The more specific and realistic you can make your resolution, the more likely you’ll keep it.</p> <h2><b>4. Become a marketing master </b></h2> <p>For some of us, promoting ourselves and our writing is the hardest part. So why not resolve to spend 2015 learning how to become a marketing master?</p> <p>If you don’t already have an <a title="Start the New Year Right with These 6 Ambitious Goals for Writers" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/6-ambitious-goals-for-writers/" target="_blank">email list</a>, for example, resolve to start one. Then resolve to make sure your email list signup is clearly visible on your <a title="An Online Portfolio Can Change Your Career: 10 Writer Websites We Love" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/writer-websites/" target="_blank">writing website</a>.</p> <p>Likewise, if your Twitter avatar is still an egg or if you haven’t yet set up a professional Facebook page, now’s the time to <a title="Get the Biggest Bang for Your Social Media Buck" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/get-the-biggest-bang-for-your-social-media-buck/" target="_blank">get better at social media</a>. As with all New Year’s resolutions, <b>make it specific</b>. Say you’ll send out 20 tweets per day, or that you’ll post every piece you publish to Facebook. Then watch your engagement and marketing abilities grow.</p> <h2><b>5. Make some art</b></h2> <p>Let’s end this list of resolutions with the now-famous <a title="My New Year Wish" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~journal.neilgaiman.com/2011/12/my-new-year-wish.html" target="_blank">New Year’s Wish</a> from Neil Gaiman:</p> <blockquote><p><em>May your coming year be filled with magic and dreams and good madness. I hope you read some fine books and kiss someone who thinks you&#8217;re wonderful, and don&#8217;t forget to make some art &#8212; write or draw or build or sing or live as only you can. And I hope, somewhere in the next year, you surprise yourself.</em></p></blockquote> <p>I hope we all make great art, get great clients, start our dream projects, find our audience and surprise ourselves in 2015.</p> <p><strong>What are your New Year’s resolutions? Remember: making the resolution is the first step to completing it.</strong></p> <span id="pty_trigger"></span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/new-years-resolutions-for-writers/">New Year’s Resolutions for Writers: 5 Goals to Amp Up Your Writing This Year</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com">The Write Life</a>.</p> <Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" alt="" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0" hspace="0" src="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/82081580/0/thewritelife">]]><![CDATA[<div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a title="Like on Facebook" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/82081580/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Share on Google+" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/82081580/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Pin it!" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/82081580/thewritelife,"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Tweet This" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/82081580/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a title="Subscribe by RSS" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/82081580/thewritelife"><img height="20" src="http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;</div>]]></content:encoded> 			<wfw:commentRss>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/82081580/0/thewritelife~New-Year%e2%80%99s-Resolutions-for-Writers-Goals-to-Amp-Up-Your-Writing-This-Year/feed/</wfw:commentRss> 		<slash:comments>12</slash:comments></item><item><feedburner:origLink>http://thewritelife.com/freelance-writing-rates-resources/</feedburner:origLink> 		<title>Freelance Writing Rates: 5 Resources for Figuring Out How Much to Charge</title> 		<link>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/82008759/0/thewritelife~Freelance-Writing-Rates-Resources-for-Figuring-Out-How-Much-to-Charge/</link> 		<comments>http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/82008759/0/thewritelife~Freelance-Writing-Rates-Resources-for-Figuring-Out-How-Much-to-Charge/#comments</comments> 		<pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2014 11:00:12 +0000</pubDate> 		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Heather van der Hoop]]></dc:creator> 				<category><![CDATA[Freelancing]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[finances]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[freelancing]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[getting started]]></category> 		<category><![CDATA[make money]]></category> 		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://thewritelife.com/?p=4232</guid> 		<description><![CDATA[<p>Not sure how much to charge?

Even within a niche like copywriting, for example, you could provide various services, writing About pages, <a title="Write Better Web Copy by Understanding Your Customers (and Giving Them What They Want)" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/write-better-web-copy/" target="_blank">sales pages</a>, product descriptions, even Kickstarter copy.</p> <p>The problem is, it’s often difficult to figure out how much to charge for different services. How do you know what rate to set for something like writing a wedding toast, crafting an online dating profile or writing a <a title="5 Well-Paying Corporate Writing Gigs for Freelancers" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/5-corporate-writing-gigs/" target="_blank">press release</a> for a corporate client?</p> <p>While you’ll find a lot of <a title="Freelancing: a Complete Guide to Setting and Negotiating Rates" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~leavingworkbehind.com/freelancing-setting-negotiating-rates/" target="_blank">differing opinions</a> on <a title="Per Word or Per Hour — Which Earns Writers the Most?" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.makealivingwriting.com/per-word-or-per-hour-which-earns-writers-the-most/" target="_blank">how to set your rates</a>, it’s also helpful to compare your planned rates to those of other writers. <b>Knowing what other people charge helps you determine whether you’re on the right track and prevents you from undervaluing your skills.</b></p> <p>Researching pay rates can be tricky, but here’s a list of useful resources on rates for different writing gigs, projects and publications.</p> <h2><b>1. Writer’s Digest’s Writers’ Market</b></h2> <p>While online access to <a title="Writer's Market" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.writersmarket.com/" target="_blank">Writer’s Market</a> will set you back $39.99 a year and the book version is $23 on <a title="Writer's Market" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/1599638401/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1599638401&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=QCIUIKRQJAWQS3OZ" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, Writer’s Digest shares Lynn Wasnak’s “<a title="What Should I Charge?" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.writersdigest.com/wp-content/uploads/WM_HMSIC.pdf" target="_blank">What Should I Charge?</a>” chapter for free online. The chapter’s handy chart lists rates for 150+ writing gigs, including both per-hour and per-project options.</p> <p>Where did this information come from? Wasnak compiled the chart from responses to a survey of 23 professional writing and editing organizations, such as American Independent Writers, National Writers Union and Writer’s Guild of America. The survey was conducted in 2010, so rates may have changed slightly since then, but they’re still a great starting point.</p> <h2><b>2. Editorial Freelancers Association’s Editorial Rates</b></h2> <p>EFA, a non-profit, volunteer-run organization, offers a membership directory, newsletter, job board and online education. Its members have also put together a <a title="EFA Rate Guide" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.the-efa.org/res/rates.php" target="_blank">list of rates</a> for common writing- and editing-related tasks, such as PR writing, ghostwriting and fact-checking.</p> <p>The chart includes per-hour, per-page and per-word pay ranges, along with an estimated pace to give writers an idea of how long a project may take. For example, translators usually manage between 300 and 500 words per hour. The rates were last updated in 2012, and as the EFA notes, they “should only be used as a rough guideline.”</p> <h2><b>3. </b><strong><em>Scratch Magazine</em></strong><b>’s Who Pays Writers</b></h2> <p>Looking for an idea of potential payment before you <a title="8 Lucrative Tips for Selling Articles to Magazines and Websites" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/8-lucrative-tips-for-selling-articles-to-magazines-and-websites/" target="_blank">pitch a magazine</a> or <a title="19 Websites and Magazines That Want to Publish Your Personal Essays" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/19-websites-magazines-want-publish-personal-essays/" target="_blank">online publication</a>?</p> <p>Created by writer and <em>Scratch</em> cofounder Manjula Martin, <a title="Who Pays Writers" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~whopays.scratchmag.net/" target="_blank">Who Pays Writers</a> is an incredible repository of information about which publications pay writers, how much they pay, and for what kind of work. Anyone can <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~whopays.scratchmag.net/submit-a-rate/">submit a rate</a>, and it’s completely anonymous.</p> <p>You’ll likely find conflicting reports of different rates for the same publications; as Martin notes, different writers command different rates based on their levels of experience, relationship with the editor, background and qualifications, etc. Many entries include whether the writer had a contact at the outlet or it was a cold pitch.</p> <h2><b>4. Write Jobs</b></h2> <p>While <a title="Write Jobs" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.writejobs.info/" target="_blank">Write Jobs</a> is a job board, reviewing its postings can help you establish whether your planned rate is too low, too high or somewhere in the middle. Look for the “With Pay Rates” option in the top menu bar to see only jobs that include pay, then scroll down to review the options.</p> <p>Many of the freelance writing jobs are from anonymous companies or Craigslist, so take the rates here with a grain of salt; they’re likely toward the lower end of the spectrum. Definitely don’t price your services lower than these rates, and don’t be afraid to aim higher.</p> <h2><b>5. Your favorite search engine</b></h2> <p>Am I recommending you simply ask Google, “How much should I charge to write [insert project here]”? Yes!</p> <p>Many writers and editors share their rates upfront on their websites; <a title="10 Lies Freelance Copywriters Like to Tell You" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://blog.kissmetrics.com/copywriting-lies/" target="_blank">James Chartrand suggests</a> this is one mark of an experienced writer.

If you’re good at breaking complex processes and diagrams into simple terms anyone can understand, you may want to consider the lucrative field of technical writing.</p> <p>This type of writing normally involves creating documentation for technical processes, software and systems. I began my career as a technical writer working in the information technology field, where I noticed how many companies around me needed custom diagrams, technical content and how-to guides. However, writers aren’t limited to IT companies; all sorts of businesses and organizations, from colleges to web development startups, need their services.</p> <p>If you’re keen to explore the world of <a title="Technical Writing: How to Break Into this Lucrative World" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/technical-writing/" target="_blank">technical writing</a>, you’ll need to develop your skills, establish contacts and find clients. Here’s how to get started.</p> <h2><b>Who needs technical writers?</b></h2> <p>Many types of businesses need technical writing services. Schools, including community colleges and distance learning institutions, may need support with curriculum development. For example, an online school may want to offer a course on how to effectively use Microsoft Excel. Businesses may need support manuals for software or articles about how best to use their products.</p> <p>Many vendors, academic institutions and government agencies need <a title="What Is a Whitepaper? [FAQs]" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-whitepaper-faqs" target="_blank">white papers</a>. These academic documents explain technical topics and often follow the same methodology as a how-to guide, but they may require additional information such as citations.</p> <p>You could also become a technical editor, though most of these roles require more experience, as you’ll need to identify mistakes in technical concepts, diagrams and pedagogy in addition to grammar and syntax.</p> <h2><b>Breaking in is easier with a mentor</b></h2> <p>The first step to building a lucrative career in technical writing is breaking in. Like other types of writing, it can be challenging, but it’s not impossible.</p> <p>As a reviewer and paralegal, <a title="Allison Bishop" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~twitter.com/AlliBish" target="_blank">Allison Bishop</a> did a lot of report writing and other document preparation work. While researching and reading articles, she became interested in writing them herself. After contacting editors at multiple publishing companies, she connected with an author who showed her the ropes of the profession. Within two months, she contributed to two technical books that were published this year.</p> <p><b>“Breaking in was easier once I had found a mentor who could assist me,”</b> said Bishop. She was able to make new contacts in the field and convince editors to offer her trial assignments. “Once I showed my editors that I was reliable, handed in my work on time and produced great work, I was offered more to do.”</p> <p>Any aspiring technical writer can follow Bishop’s lead: As you build your network and make contacts within the field, approach one or two about helping you learn the business.</p> <h2><b>Develop a technical writing resume and portfolio</b></h2> <p>Create a technical writing resume and <a title="7 Great Portfolio Sites for Freelance Writers (And Most are Free)" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/freelance-portfolio-sites/" target="_blank">portfolio</a> featuring samples of your work. Since you’re new to technical writing and likely don’t have previous work in the field, highlight as much relevant experience as possible. Use <a title="Sample Technical Writer Resume" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~news.dice.com/2011/01/01/sample-resume-technical-writer/" target="_blank">sample resumes</a> <a title="Sample Technical Writer Resume" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.careerfaqs.com.au/careers/sample-resumes-and-cover-letters/technical-writer-sample-resume/" target="_blank">like these</a> to guide you as you present your past work in the best possible light. Consider focusing on a specific niche, such as health care or software, that builds on your education or work experience.</p> <p>You’ll also need to create samples of your work. Don’t let the fact that no one’s ever hired you for a technical writing job stop you!</p> <p>“Since I was just entering the field, I created sample technical writings so that potential hiring managers could evaluate my work,” said Bishop. Volunteer to help a friend or contact with a project, or create your own. Perhaps you could rewrite support documents for a well-known tool, such as the iPad <a title="Apple Support Manuals" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~support.apple.com/manuals/" target="_blank">how-to manual</a>. Or develop a user guide for a product you enjoy, like Tim Murphy did with <a title="The Mint Manual" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=225673&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=243758" target="_blank">The Mint Manual</a>.</p> <p>You could also review new products on your blog or write guest posts for technical sites, like this post I wrote about <a title="Protect yourself from Creepware!" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~scitechconnect.elsevier.com/protect-creepware/" target="_blank">using software to provide security</a>. Add your work to your portfolio and share it on LinkedIn and <a title="4 Mistakes Even the Best Writers Make on Twitter" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/mistakes-writers-make-twitter/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to develop your personal brand and show potential clients what you can do.</p> <h2><b>Combine job boards with networking</b></h2> <p>Now that you have a resume and portfolio to highlight your experience, you need to <a title="A Step-by-Step Guide for Going After Clients You Really Want" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/going-after-clients-you-really-want/" target="_blank">find clients</a>. Technical writing jobs are generally posted with other writing opportunities, so keep an eye on your favorite <a title="9 Online Gold Mines for Finding Paid Freelance Writing Jobs" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/find-freelance-writing-jobs/" target="_blank">freelance writing job sites</a>. You can set up alerts on many of these sites to email you when technical writing jobs are posted.</p> <p>However, you’ll also want to go beyond the job boards to find potential opportunities. “I contacted organizations directly and sent them my technical writing resume,” said Bishop. “Once they saw that I could create what they needed, they hired me immediately.”</p> <p><b>Develop a network of contacts at organizations or firms that require technical writers.</b> First, look within your existing network for people who might be able to help &#8212; do you know anyone who works at the types of organizations or businesses we discussed above? Get in touch and share your portfolio and resume.</p> <p>Look at the tools and products you use on a daily basis, and check out their documentation; could their creators use help with a FAQ, troubleshooting guidelines, how-to manual or other technical writing? Contact the company to pitch your services.</p> <p>Consider attending conferences or technology-focused events in your area to help connect with other potential clients. Always be on the lookout for ways to expand your network.</p> <p>Whether you’re looking for a full-time technical writing role or freelance work, you’ll need to work hard to master your niche and develop an active network. However, there’s a lot of work out there for technical writers &#8212; good luck with your new specialty!</p> <p><b>Have you tried technical writing?

See below to enter and you could win a chance to be interviewed in February or April 2015.</i></p> <p>When we talk about <a title="Author Platform: Here’s What All the Fuss Is About" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/author-platform/" target="_blank">author platform</a>, many writers think about print media such as books and blog posts. Based on my own experience building my own author platform, an audio component such as an Internet radio show makes a great addition.</p> <p><b>A radio show adds a different dimension to your writing and generates interest in you and your book.</b> When people read your website and <a title="7 More Writing Blogs That Want Your Guest Posts" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/blogs-to-pitch-guest-posts/" target="_blank">guest posts</a>, they are “reading your voice” and imagining what you sound like. On a radio show, your fans can hear and “feel” you much more directly than they can through an article.</p> <p>In addition, a radio show helps you build public speaking and media credits. If you’re looking to get on syndicated news, local radio and news channels and even national television, a radio show will help you share your personality with producers.</p> <p>Sound like something you might want to do? Here’s how to develop your own radio show.</p> <h2><b>My experience as a radio show host</b></h2> <p>My global radio show, “Giving Voice to Your Story,” went live in July 2013 as part of the Creating Calm Network Broadcast Group. I had already established myself as a blogger, but I wanted to create a more solid online platform and prepare for the release of my memoir, even though the publishing date was over a year and a half away.</p> <p>I connected online with non-fiction authors and memoirists I liked and to my surprise, many wholeheartedly wanted to be interviewed! It wasn’t long before I’d built a following. Within five months, I was able to bring on board noted authors such as Julia Cameron, author of <a title="The Artist’s Way" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585421464/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1585421464&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=UKLC43ZQCSGAAXVF" target="_blank"><i>The Artist’s Way</i></a>, and Linda Gray Sexton, <a title="Linda Gray Sexton" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582437440/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1582437440&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thwrli02-20&amp;linkId=4NVG4XLMAFXLFV2U" target="_blank">memoirist</a> and daughter of the Pulitzer-prize-winning poet Anne Sexton.</p> <p>Since I launched my radio show, people have started recognizing me as an expert because I associate myself with expert authors.</p> <h2><b>Planning your radio show</b></h2> <p>As when writing an article, blog post or novel, the first thing you do is plan the subject matter of your radio show. Keep in mind that the topic should be something about which you are knowledgeable and feel passionate about, and one that potential book-buyers will be interested in.</p> <p>Your show might include chapter-by-chapter readings of your book, how-to tips or interviews.  In my experience, <b>listeners are a lot less interested in stories than they are in the lessons they can learn from them.</b> Talk about the life lessons you learned or share advice from your experience, and then allude to your book, which of course goes into more detail.</p> <p>On my blog as well as on my show, I talk about various craft issues related to memoir such as the voice of experience versus the voice of innocence, how to break the silence and write about challenging emotions or painful parts of life, or how to write about uncomfortable issues so that one’s memoir doesn’t read like a journal, but an actual story.</p> <p>I refer to specific scenes to talk about these issues. For example, I finally broke my silence to write about<a title="Memoir Writing Techniques that Help You Voice Your Truth and Break the Silence" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.givingavoicetothevoicelessbook.com/2014/11/08/voice-painful-story-writing-memoir-use-narrative-summary/" target="_blank"> a bullying experience</a> while serving in the Israel Defense Forces, and my next step is to broadcast a “break the silence” radio episode. I shared these insights on a recent LinkedIn discussion along with a previous link to the show and readers were not only grateful, but shared their thoughts behind the challenges. The comments quickly turned into a great discussion and helped create a supportive community.</p> <p>Aim for a show between 15 and 60 minutes long. You’ll want people to be able to listen to it in one sitting (or one trip), but you don’t want it to be so short that your listeners will resent the fact they bothered to tune in or download it. Consider adding music to open and close the program. Google “public domain music” or “royalty-free music” for download options.</p> <p>How often you choose to put out a new episode is up to you, but I feel the frequency of a radio show follows the same rules as blog posts: <b>Release a new episode as often as you think you can commit to regularly and faithfully.</b> The shorter the show, the more frequent you can be without overloading your audience.</p> <h2><b>Interested in interviewing guests?</b></h2> <p>You’d be surprised how happy agents are to book one of their authors as a guest on a radio show. You can also put a call out for guests on your social media channels. With <a title="5 Marketing Strategies for Writers Who Hate Promoting Their Own Work" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/marketing-strategies-for-writers/" target="_blank">self-promotion</a> so necessary to book sales, authors are hungry to spread the word about their work.</p> <p>Whenever I finish a great memoir, I immediately connect with the author online and inquire if he or she is interested in being on my show. Almost 99% of the time, the answer is yes. This is how I’ve secured most of my guest appearances. <b>The key is to start with your local community of authors and build your way up.</b> After a while, you’ll build a following and you can quote your number of listeners when you’re approaching bigger-name authors.</p> <h2><b>Essential equipment</b></h2> <p>To broadcast your radio show, you’ll need a few things:</p> <ul> <li><b>A computer or laptop with high-speed Internet connection</b>. The beauty of hosting your own radio show is that you can do it from the comforts of your own home.</li> <li><b>A headset with both headphones and microphone.</b> The benefit to the headset is that you can adjust the distance of the mic from your mouth and it stays there.</li> </ul> <p>That’s it! Easy, right?</p> <h2><b>Broadcasting a show</b></h2> <p><a title="Blog Talk Radio" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.kqzyfj.com/click-7319408-10866550" target="_blank">Blog Talk Radio</a> is the most popular venue for Internet radio and offers an easy start up. There are three tiers of monthly payments, with more benefits as you move up to the account types. There’s also a free account, but it only allows five listeners, so it’s not as useful.</p> <p>The main difference between the three packages ($39, $99 and $249) is the number of shows you can broadcast as well as more promotions. With the $249 package, you can live-stream from any website rather than just on Blog Talk Radio’s site.</p> <p>I’ve made the switch to <a title="Instant Teleseminar" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~instantteleseminar.com/" target="_blank">Instant Teleseminar</a>, which is user-friendly for both the listener and host. My recordings are immediately available after the show, so I can post them on my site for listeners to download.</p> <h2><b>Get ready for your first show</b></h2> <p>Here’s a handy checklist of how to prepare before and during the show:</p> <ul> <li><b>Make sure you’re recording in a quiet place.</b> Microphones pick up strange sounds that can easily distract listeners.</li> <li><b>Write an outline or script for your show before recording. </b>This cuts down on the “ums” and “ahs.”</li> <li><b>If you’re doing a live recording</b> (a show you’ve promoted with listeners tuning in live, rather than one recorded for later download) <b>make sure you’re comfortable with your equipment and software.</b> Practice beforehand so your first live show goes smoothly. Offer listeners a chance during the show to ask questions.</li> </ul> <h2><b>Marketing and promoting your radio show</b></h2> <p>Now that you’ve finished your first episode, you need a home base to fully capitalize on the marketing potential of your episodes. A blog or <a title="An Online Portfolio Can Change Your Career: 10 Writer Websites We Love" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~thewritelife.com/writer-websites/" target="_blank">writer website</a> is a good option and makes you easier to find. Make sure that your site has the link to your latest show prominently displayed along with your contact information.</p> <p>Since I’m part of a network, the show producers help promote all of the network’s shows. My show appears on its own <a title="Giving Voice to Your Story" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.creatingcalmnetwork.com/giving-voice-to-your-story.html" target="_blank">home page</a> and on the network’s social media channels.</p> <p><b>Promote your show on your own by creating tweets and Facebook posts highlighting different points in the radio show.</b> For example, you could mention a lesson you learned in an unlikely situation, then link to your upcoming episode (or recording) for people to learn more.</p> <p>Make your latest episodes easy to find, and distribute recordings on established networks such as<a title="iTunes" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~apple.com/itunes" target="_blank"> iTunes</a> or <a title="Audible" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.jdoqocy.com/click-7319408-3216228" target="_blank">Audible</a>, which let you upload your recordings for wider distribution. Be sure to include your name and URL at the beginning and end of each recording, and consider crafting a short, catchy promo to share on your networks.</p> <h2><b>Not ready to host your own show?</b></h2> <p>Instead of going it alone, take on a cohost or two. You could either record together for a talk-show-like adventure, or host your own episodes as part of a group show. You’d see many of the same benefits, but without having to record a new episode quite as often.</p> <p><b>If hosting a radio show sounds too daunting, consider being a guest on a show.</b> Choose one that speaks to you. One great way to get started is to check the daily listings over at <a title="Help a Reporter Out" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/thewritelife/~www.helpareporter.com/" target="_blank">Help a Reporter Out</a> (HARO). I see requests for radio show guests almost daily. Subscribe to the daily digest to receive updates on all kinds of media requests. You can also set up a Google Alert for “radio show” and “guests wanted/needed” which you can receive up to several times a day straight to your inbox.</p> <p>Another option is to search for radio shows in your genres. You’ll find lots of them out there, so again, you’ll need to be choosy. Approach the host or producer and ask if he or she has slots for guests for future interviews. It never hurts to ask! As a guest, you’ll still have to prepare for the show, but you’ll be spreading the word about your book, building your brand and creating a following with less pressure than hosting your own show.</p> <p>Hosting your own radio show can be an effective way to round out your online presence while giving you one more way to engage and connect with your audience.
