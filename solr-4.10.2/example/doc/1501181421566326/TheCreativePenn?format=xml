				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Your email list is the only way to consistently let fans know about your work.</h3>
<p>If you own this list, you can always earn money from your creative work.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-20277" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/iStock_000017648624XSmall-300x261.jpg" alt="email" width="300" height="261" />Email is a critical part of how I connect with my audience, as well as how I make income, because once you have a list of people who have opted in to hear about your work, then you can tell them when you have books and products available.</p>
<p>This is how I was able to launch <a title="how to market a book" href="http://viewBook.at/marketbook" target="_blank">How to Market a Book</a> and <a title="business for authors" href="http://viewbook.at/authorbusiness" target="_blank">Business for Authors</a> straight onto the Bestseller lists on Amazon next to some pretty big hitters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/businessbook/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-20962" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/BusinessBestseller100914-1024x454.jpg" alt="BusinessBestseller100914" width="600" height="266" /></a></p>
<p>The method for <a title="build an email list for marketing" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2010/09/25/how-authors-and-writers-can-build-an-email-list-for-marketing/" target="_blank">building an email list</a> for non-fiction is well-established, and involves giving something of value for free in exchange for an email. Since you are usually providing targeted information with non-fiction work, it&#8217;s easy enough to think of a useful giveaway in exchange for an email address.</p>
<p>My <a title="author 2.0 blueprint" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/blueprint/" target="_blank">Author 2.0 Blueprint</a> (rewritten <a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/blueprint/"><img class="alignright wp-image-16695" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Author-Blueprint-3D-COver-259x300.jpg" alt="Author Blueprint 3D COver" width="200" height="231" /></a>and updated in Nov 2014) is now 92 pages of information on writing, publishing, book marketing and creative entrepreneurship, representing everything I know, for free. Lots of people sign up for it every day because it is obviously useful! (<a title="the creative penn blueprint" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/blueprint/" target="_blank">Get it here</a>)</p>
<h2>But growing your fiction email list is more challenging!</h2>
<p>The principles are the same of course, and I have been been growing my <a title="J.F.Penn" href="http://www.jfpenn.com" target="_blank">J.F.Penn</a> email list slowly over the last 18 months by offering a free short story and newsletter.</p>
<p>The results have not been that brilliant, to be honest!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MMQN0VG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00MMQN0VG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=LMGLBV3K5FLUQFUJ"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20826" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-02-at-2.42.59-pm-203x300.jpg" alt="supercharge" width="170" height="251" /></a>But then <a title="nick stephenson" href="http://noorosha.com/10k-readers/" target="_blank">Nick Stephenson</a>, author of <a title="supercharge your kindle sales" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MMQN0VG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00MMQN0VG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=LMGLBV3K5FLUQFUJ" target="_blank">Supercharge your Kindle Sales</a>, approached me with an opportunity.</p>
<p>He has a background in marketing and wanted to help supercharge my fiction email subscriber list by making a few changes on my site and in my books.</p>
<p><strong>We all have myopia when it comes to our own work</strong>, and sometimes it just takes an outside opinion to improve things.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always open to feedback and improvement, so I jumped at the chance to work with Nick. Here&#8217;s what he suggested, and the results.</p>
<h2>(1) Add a list signup in the FRONT of the books, as well as the back. Plus, use an enticing image instead of text.</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.jfpenn.com/freebook/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-20822" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-02-at-2.15.17-pm-300x209.jpg" alt="free book" width="300" height="209" /></a>I&#8217;ve had a list signup call-to-action in the back of my books for several years now, with the assumption that only those people who want to hear more from me will want to sign up, and those people would have finished the book.</p>
<p>Nick suggested I add something <strong>more enticing at the front</strong> as well as the back, particularly in my permafree book, <a title="Pentecost" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/pentecost/" target="_blank">Pentecost, An ARKANE Thriller Book 1.</a> A free book is more enticing than a &#8216;newsletter&#8217; or a &#8216;free short story.&#8217; It&#8217;s got to be value add.</p>
<p>This is all explained in Nick&#8217;s post on <a title="reader magnets" href="http://noorosha.com/what-are-reader-magnets/" target="_blank">Reader Magnets</a>.</p>
<p>He also suggested <strong>using an image</strong> and not just a text call-to-action. You can see the one I&#8217;m now using above right. It&#8217;s definitely more enticing than a line of text with the same information. It links through to <a title="free book" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/freebook/" target="_blank">my Free Book page</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.jfpenn.com/freebook/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20824 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-02-at-2.27.18-pm-197x300.jpg" alt="squeeze page" width="197" height="300" /></a>(2) Use a website squeeze page + email signup page with no distractions</h2>
<p>Again, I have had an email subscribe box on the front page and sidebar of <a title="JF Penn" href="http://www.jfpenn.com" target="_blank">JFPenn.com</a> since I began the site, but it wasn&#8217;t prominent and it wasn&#8217;t that enticing.</p>
<p>Nick&#8217;s research showed that a squeeze page where people needed to click a button BEFORE they entered their email had a better conversion rate than just an email sign up box.</p>
<p>So we created <a title="free book" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/freebook/" target="_blank">this page</a> so people could see what they&#8217;d be getting and a bit about me.</p>
<p><strong>The only thing people can do on that page is to click the button in the middle or click away.</strong> If they click the button, then they get to enter their email, confirm the subsequent email (for anti-spam compliance) and then they get directed to a download page for the book in multiple formats.</p>
<h2>(3) Use free content readers actually want</h2>
<p>I used to have a free short story and newsletter as enticement for signing up to my fiction list. Nick pointed out that <em>&#8220;no one wants a short story&#8221;! </em>Of course, I think the stories are great and some people DO want to read short stories, but not as many people as would like an actual book.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.jfpenn.com/freebook/"><img class="alignright wp-image-19754 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/VikingsSmall-199x300.jpg" alt="VikingsSmall" width="199" height="300" /></a>So I decided to use <a title="day of the vikings" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/vikings/" target="_blank">Day of the Vikings</a> as an enticing giveaway. It&#8217;s a rollicking novella with lots of good reviews so it has real value. If people want this and like it, they will like my other books.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty representative of my writing style in general, plus it combines the characters from my two series: Morgan Sierra from <a title="arkane thrillers" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/arkane-thrillers/" target="_blank">the ARKANE series</a> and Blake Daniel from the <a title="london psychic" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/londonpsychic/" target="_blank">London Psychic series</a>, so leads people into both of my worlds.</p>
<h2>(4) Use permafree promotions to get traffic into your funnel</h2>
<p>Once the signup page and the call to action is set up within the specific book you are using as a Reader Magnet, then you want to get more traffic to that book. One way is to use a permafree book at the beginning of the series. I have had <a title="Pentecost" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/pentecost/" target="_blank">Pentecost as permafree</a> on all stores for several <a href="http://viewbook.at/Pentecost"><img class="alignleft wp-image-19749 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/PentecostNew2014Smaller-194x300.jpg" alt="PentecostNew2014Smaller" width="194" height="300" /></a>years now, with over 100,000 downloads. I am clearly kicking myself that I didn&#8217;t have all this set up earlier!</p>
<p>Some would say that the benefits of permafree have gone with the introduction of Kindle Unlimited and a flood of free books. But I&#8217;m still getting a few hundred to a thousand a month with Pentecost which is a good trickle as some of those go on to sign up and then may read the other books in the series – without relying on any other marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Ideally, you want to try to get a BookBub, Kindle Nation Daily or other promotion in order to start the flow of signups. But regardless, your daily downloads of the permafree book should start them trickling in anyway.</p>
<h2>(5) Set up better initial email communication with auto-responders</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.jfpenn.com/books-i-love/"><img class="alignright wp-image-20970 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-12-at-3.28.57-pm-300x285.jpg" alt="books I love" width="300" height="285" /></a>I use auto-responders on this site if you sign up for the Blueprint. These are automatic emails that are sent at specific times after signup with no additional effort from me. It&#8217;s more difficult for fiction as the aim is entertainment as opposed to education.</p>
<p>Nick suggested just being more open about who I am and why I write, as well as talking about what readers can expect from me. I have included an email about the <a title="fiction books I love" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/books-i-love/" target="_blank">types of books I like </a>which hopefully gives the recipient and I something in common.</p>
<p>I know it took me several years of blogging here to become really open in my communication – so I am just early days on the fiction side. So if this kind of thing freaks you out, I totally understand!</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>When I implemented these changes in Nov 2014, I had 603 people on my fiction list. This had taken about 18 months to get to &#8211; not a fantastic result, but hey, I&#8217;m in this for the long term and it wasn&#8217;t really worrying me.</p>
<p>So has it worked?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/topgold/6399333937/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20973 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-12-at-3.36.57-pm-300x216.jpg" alt="success" width="300" height="216" /></a>As I write this in mid Jan 2015, I have 2255 subscribers on my fiction list, a (very) significant increase in a short amount of time. I have some advertising booked on my permafree book coming up soon, so I will expect to see some more increases then too.</p>
<p>But basically, the changes are likely to work for the long term as they provide more value add for readers and are more obvious.</p>
<h2>Why have I &#8220;failed&#8221; at this before?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking hard about this. Why was I successful in growing a non-fiction list and not a fiction one? The mechanism is much the same. For me, it has come down to:</p>
<h3><strong>Lack of confidence.</strong></h3>
<p>Feeling that I didn&#8217;t really want to advertise my fiction that much, just in case people didn&#8217;t like it or me. I&#8217;ve talked about <a title="fear of judgment" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2013/03/17/writing-fear-of-judgment/" target="_blank">fear of judgement</a> before and it still bites me on every release.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s taken me a long time to become more confident in my fiction writing, and I have generally kept that on the back burner whilst writing more books. But with the publication of <a title="Desecration" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/desecration/" target="_blank">Desecration</a>, I began to feel I was <a href="http://viewbook.at/Desecration"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-19760" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/desecration216smaller-200x300.jpg" alt="desecration216smaller" width="200" height="300" /></a>ready to share more about my fiction. I&#8217;m damn proud of that book &#8211; of all my books, yes, but that one in particular because <a title="stopped self-censoring" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/11/20/writing-fiction-shadow/" target="_blank">I stopped self-censoring</a>.</p>
<p>This switch in email marketing is just the latest in a series of changes as I move into the next phase of being a more successful fiction author.</p>
<h3>There&#8217;s something else that will stop you: Not enough product.</h3>
<p>If you only have one book, you won&#8217;t want to make it permafree, even if that could get you a list of readers for the next book. If you only have two books, it will still be hard. Three &#8230; you&#8217;ll be almost ready.</p>
<p>So yes, as usual with fiction, writing more books will help you with everything &#8211; with your craft, with building an audience and with your confidence.</p>
<h2>Your turn</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.yourfirst10kreaders.com/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20959" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-12-at-2.49.02-pm-300x201.jpg" alt="10K readers" width="200" height="134" /></a>If you haven&#8217;t started an email list at all yet, definitely put it on your list for 2015. I use <a title="aweber" href="http://aweber.com/?utm_source=affiliate&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=static&amp;utm_content=125x125whiteenv&amp;id=319181" target="_blank">Aweber</a>, and Mailchimp is another alternative option.</p>

<p>I love reading and I love books, plus I believe writers are usually great readers. We spend our lives immersed with our minds elsewhere, in someone else&#8217;s world or one of our own creation. Happy times indeed!</p>
<p><a title="hugh howey reading habits" href="http://www.hughhowey.com/confessions-of-a-digital-immigrant/" target="_blank">Hugh Howey posted a video about his reading habits</a> and thoughts on the state of e-readers last week, and I was inspired to create my own version.</p>
<p>In the video below, I talk about how I read, I show you some of my book collection, how I discover books, what annoys me as a reader and how I review and share the love.</p>
<p>You can watch the video below or <a title="how I read" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuTrpOkMva8" target="_blank">here on YouTube</a>, or read the notes underneath, which include (affiliate) links to the books I talk about. The mic is a little off (I&#8217;ve got a new one on order) but I hope you enjoy it!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JG8GOWU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00JG8GOWU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=GKMVSGWAOKNMTCB5"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20936 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-09-at-4.05.02-pm-212x300.jpg" alt="kindle paperwhite" width="212" height="300" /></a>I read primarily on the <a title="kindle paperwhite" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JG8GOWU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00JG8GOWU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=GKMVSGWAOKNMTCB5" target="_blank">Kindle Paperwhite </a>at home, the <a title="kindle app" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/digital/fiona/kcp-landing-page?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=kcp_ipad_mkt_lnd" target="_blank">Kindle app</a> on the <a title="iphone 5" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097CZJEO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0097CZJEO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=LAOKPRXEXXDBAWAT" target="_blank">iPhone 5</a>. In the video, I demonstrate my &#8216;reading on the Tube&#8217; technique, page turning and highlighting!</p>
<p>I love the <strong>auto-synch between devices</strong>. I finish in bed on the Paperwhite and start on the Tube on my iPhone. I get highlights from non-fiction on the Kindle app on the Mac when I am working &#8211; I LOVE highlighting. I&#8217;m probably an addict! I later transfer my highlighted notes to my notebooks by hand.</p>
<p>I own over 1000 books on Kindle and have about 200 samples on my Paperwhite right now. In the same way that owning print books was part of my life even without reading them, it&#8217;s the same for ebooks.I also think <strong>it&#8217;s an extension of my brain</strong> and I use search on the Mac app when I want to research stuff and often find books I haven&#8217;t read in a while.</p>
<p>I rarely read paper and never read fiction in print anymore. I do own some non-fiction in print and I show you some of my books in the video:</p>
<ul>
<li>Textbooks &#8211; <a title="story mckee" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060391685/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060391685&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=GBCU3YWBKMT3GBLI" target="_blank">STORY by Robert McKee</a></li>

<p>I also listen to some non-fiction audiobooks: <a title="success principles" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KQGSX2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000KQGSX2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=G4YCSMPEYKH5UJX3" target="_blank">Jack Canfield &#8211; The Success Principles</a> and <a title="turning pro pressfield" href="http://shop.blackirishbooks.com/products/turning-pro" target="_blank">Steven Pressfield&#8217;s Turning Pro</a>. I own both of these books in ebook, print and audio formats as they continue to have a huge impact on me.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I believe digital is the future is the <a title="demographic shift to cities" href="http://www.who.int/gho/urban_health/situation_trends/urban_population_growth_text/en/" target="_blank">demographic shift into cities</a> and smaller space living. Americans may not see this so much, but in Europe, we mostly live in smaller spaces and physical books clutter the place quickly.</p>
<p>We left behind over 2000 print books when we left Australia &#8211; many of which I had paid to ship from England to New Zealand and then on to Brisbane. It was practically impossible to sell them second-hand so we gave most of them away to local students. I find <strong>I am now replacing books I used to own in paper on ebooks</strong> even if I am not ready to re-read them yet.</p>
<p><strong>I probably read about 5x as much fiction now</strong> as I used to in print, because of the prohibitive cost in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<h2>Why am I a Kindle customer?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s basically first mover advantage! I love Kobo and iBooks and Nook and all the other options but they weren&#8217;t around when I started on ebooks.</p>
<div id="attachment_20935" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-20935" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-09-at-3.48.32-pm-300x272.jpg" alt="kindle in hammock" width="300" height="272" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Reading the 1st Kindle in my hammock in Australia</p></div>
<p>I was living in Australia in 2008/2009 when e-readers started to emerge. At the time, print books were AU$25-$35 which is about 3x the price of UK books. I had almost stopped reading fiction and my non-fiction reading had dropped significantly.</p>
<p>The Sony Reader was the first on my radar but it wasn&#8217;t compelling. Then the Kindle launched and I was hooked. Here&#8217;s <a title="review of international kindle" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2009/10/27/international-kindle-a-review-from-a-biblioholic-stuck-in-a-land-of-expensive-print-books/" target="_blank">my review of the first international Kindle</a>. <em>[That brings back memories!]</em></p>
<p>I continue to be a very happy Kindle junkie!</p>
<h2>How do I find books</h2>
<p>If I know and love the author and the book is available on Kindle, I will pre-order it. I don&#8217;t worry too much about price.</p>
<p>For impulse purchases, I will buy anything I fancy under £2 (US$4), but I don&#8217;t usually download free books. <strong>I prefer to pay</strong>, and I&#8217;m not a member of Kindle Unlimited, mainly because so many books are not in KU that I want to read.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a budget for books, so I buy what I want, when I want. <strong>I buy books almost every day, but then it&#8217;s pretty much my only vice!</strong></p>
<p>I will buy books to keep for later and I don&#8217;t necessarily read everything I buy. When I&#8217;m researching something e.g. mythology, I will search in my own ebook library first to see if I have already bought something on the topic since I often buy in order to &#8220;own&#8221; books, as I did with print.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250033438/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1250033438&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=CLCGGOCJOJMUQ65L"><img class="alignright wp-image-20939 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-09-at-4.18.52-pm-205x300.jpg" alt="code zero" width="205" height="300" /></a>For fiction, <strong>I browse the genre categories of thriller, dark fantasy, non-fiction etc for books released in the last 30 days.</strong></p>
<p>I rarely browse the overall bestseller lists as my book turnover is so fast. <strong>I definitely download samples based on cover design</strong> &#8211; I picked up <a title="code zero" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250033438/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1250033438&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=CLCGGOCJOJMUQ65L" target="_blank">Jonathan Maberry&#8217;s Code Zero</a> because I loved the cover and have spent the last month binge reading his Joe Ledger series.</p>
<p><strong>I will pay more for non-fiction</strong> and will buy from unknown authors more easily if the topic grabs me. If I can learn a couple of new things per non-fiction book, I consider that worth the money.</p>
<p><strong>I will often buy based on listening to author interviews on podcasts</strong> or books recommended by bloggers like <a title="four hour work week" href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/" target="_blank">Tim Ferriss</a>. I also monitor the fantastic <a title="brain pickings" href="http://www.brainpickings.org/" target="_blank">Brain Pickings</a> site and get a lot of books from there. Plus, I find books on twitter through recommendations that way.</p>
<p><strong>When I find things I like, I sample.</strong> That means that I download a percentage. I usually give the book 4- 5 clicks/page turns and if it hasn&#8217;t grabbed me, I delete the sample. If I make it to the end of the sample, I will usually buy and continue reading. I&#8217;ve talked in length about <a title="sampling" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2013/02/02/sampling/" target="_blank">the importance of sampling for authors before</a>.</p>
<h2>What annoys me as a reader</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Books not available as Kindle books</strong>, for example, the entire James Michener backlist, which is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375760385/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0375760385&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=YTKKJ4VREM3KLQLI"><img class="alignright wp-image-20940 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-09-at-4.28.11-pm-201x300.jpg" alt="the source" width="201" height="300" /></a>substantial and weighty. <a title="james michener the source" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375760385/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0375760385&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=YTKKJ4VREM3KLQLI" target="_blank">The Source</a> is one of my favorite books and it&#8217;s not on ebook. Seriously Random House, sort that out!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>US first releases.</strong> In a world of online marketing, staggered releases by region is just a pain and annoys readers. I will see a tweet from the author on release and then I will forget about it unless I can immediately download a sample.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Print only launches</strong>. I generally won&#8217;t buy books in print so if you don&#8217;t release a Kindle version on launch, I may well have forgotten it by the time the ebook version comes out. At least include a pre-order button if you want to do print first.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Samples</strong> that include acknowledgements, forewords, essays by someone else etc. That should all go at the back so I don&#8217;t have to wade through that. Make sure your words hook me and I don&#8217;t have to wade through</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ebooks that are clearly just <strong>scanned versions of print books</strong> so they don&#8217;t flow properly. Please invest in doing a specific edition for Kindle.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How I review books</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2460248.Joanna_Penn"><img class="alignleft wp-image-17254 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-08-30-at-12.58.42-PM-300x127.png" alt="Goodreads" width="300" height="127" /></a>Since the <a title="sock puppetry" href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/04/sock-puppetry-publish-be-damned" target="_blank">sock puppet controversy</a>, I have mostly stopped reviewing on Amazon in case of any issues there. So I review on <a title="reviews on goodreads" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2460248.Joanna_Penn" target="_blank">Goodreads instead &#8211; follow my reviews here.</a></p>
<p>I include book recommendations in both my newsletters &#8211; fiction for <a title="fiction free book" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/freebook/" target="_blank">J.F.Penn subscribers</a> and non-fiction for <a title="the creative penn blueprint" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/blueprint/" target="_blank">TheCreativePenn subscribers</a>.</p>
<p>I do blog posts with lists of books like my <a title="christmas day reading" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/12/25/christmas-day-reading/" target="_blank">Christmas reading list</a>, or <a title="winter thrillers" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/winter-thrillers/" target="_blank">thrillers for a winter&#8217;s night</a>. Plus I have this list of <a title="fiction books I love" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/books-i-love/" target="_blank">fiction books I love</a>, and this list of <a title="books for authors" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/books-for-writers/" target="_blank">non-fiction books for writers</a>.</p>
<p>I also share a lot on social media, primarily <a title="twitter thecreativepenn" href="http://twitter.com/thecreativepenn" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, with buy links. Plus, I buy books for others as my primary gifting.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">OK, now it&#8217;s your turn. I&#8217;d love to know about your reading habits so please leave a comment below or leave a link to a blog post or video on the topic. How do you read? How do you find books? How do you review and pass on the love?</span></h3>

<h2><strong><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-20819" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-02-at-1.55.45-pm-300x266.jpg" alt="talking business" width="300" height="266" />How to make a living as an author. Mark McGuinness interviews Joanna Penn</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Hello, everybody, welcome to <a href="http://lateralaction.com/">LateralAction.com</a>. This is Mark McGuinness, and I’m very pleased to welcome Joanna Penn. Hi, Jo, how are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Hi, Mark, thanks so much for having me on!</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Well, it’s a real pleasure. Many of you will know Joanna already, but for those of you who are new to her work, she leads a double life, firstly as <a href="http://jfpenn.com">J.F.Penn</a>, New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of, you call them ‘thrillers with an edge.’</p>
<h3><strong>Can you just explain what exactly they are? What kind of an edge is it? </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> It was funny, because you don’t need a tagline as a fiction author, but my friend, <a href="http://lateralaction.com/cj-lyons/">C.J. Lyons, who you’ve had on Lateral Action</a>, who’s brilliant, she has a great one: ‘Thrillers with heart,’ and I was thinking, so, what do I write?</p>
<p>And I write action adventure, but I also write supernatural things, and I write on the edge of horror, on the edge of action, on the edge of paranormal, supernatural and religious. So, this edge for me is the edge that you walk in this world, I guess, between what could be of one genre or another; what could be faithless, as science; what could be spirituality versus religion. That’s my edge; I feel like most books I write, I’m walking some kind of edge.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> There’s quite a few edges in there. That’s by day: and then also by day, but maybe also other times as well, you are Joanna Penn, host of <a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/">The Creative Penn</a> podcast and blog, and author of an ever-expanding series of <a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/books/">non-fiction books for creatives</a> on topics like presentation skills, and marketing books. And the reason we’re talking today is that Jo’s written a really great book. It’s called “Business for Authors.” Have I <a href="http://viewbook.at/authorbusiness"><img class="alignright wp-image-19786 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/entreA-200x300.jpg" alt="business for authors" width="200" height="300" /></a>got the title right?</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Yes. “Business for Authors: How to be an Author-Entrepreneur.”</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> That’s right. Long-time readers and listeners at Lateral Action will know that one of the big things I’ve been trying to encourage people to do is to <strong>stop thinking like needy artists or freelancers living hand to mouth, and start thinking and acting like creative entrepreneurs</strong>, so, take your art, your creativity, and unlock some of the value of the intellectual property that you’re creating each time you create a piece of art, and start to create a thriving business around that. And Jo is one of the exemplars of this. She’s one of the people I say, “Look at Jo, look at what she’s doing.”</p>
<p>I think it’s a really great book, and I want to say up front, although obviously it’s called “Business for Authors,” <strong>a lot of the content is relevant whether you’re a writer or you’re a designer or you’re another kind of creative</strong>.</p>
<p>Some of it is obviously specific, but the fundamentals, I think, are going to be very relevant. So, so don’t think, “Oh no, I’m not an author, this isn’t going to be relevant for me”: trust me, there’s going to be a lot in what Jo says that will touch a chord if you’re self-employed as a creative.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> It’s funny you say that, actually, because I started out as “How to be a Creative Entrepreneur”: the first draft, I had a whole section for Etsy people and designers, and I had some for sculptors and artists, because you’re right, pretty much everything in here, it’s how to run a small business.</p>
<p>But as we know, you can’t write a book that’s really wide, and how to run a small business is just way too wide. So, in the same way that my “<a title="how to market a book" href="http://viewbook.at/marketbook" target="_blank">How to Market a Book</a>” is essentially the principles of how to market anything, with a couple of chapters about Amazon, thank you for saying that, because I agree, it really is a business book for creatives.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Logically, you’re right, it is how to run a small business. And yet the emotional side, I think, is so critical, and what I really like, particularly at the beginning, where you address the whole mind-set issue, and the resistance that a lot of us have, I certainly did, to anything to do with the very idea of business, it seemed to be the work of the Devil. I love the way you reframe that, well, give us the answer that you give in the book.</p>
<h3><strong>What do you say to the creative person who says, “I’m just not interested in running a business at all”?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Well, I think there’s two ways to look at it. The one person who really just isn’t interested in business and is just doing this for a creative reason, that’s like <a title="checklist for new authors" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2013/11/04/checklist-for-new-authors/" target="_blank">helping my dad publish his book for his 65<sup>th</sup> birthday</a>: that was just a creative project, something to say, “I’ve done this.” It was never going to be a commercial project. But what’s so funny is so many people say, “Oh, I’m not worried about business, I don’t care about the money,” and then they get all angsty when they don’t sell any books!</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Something’s not quite matched up there, is it.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> No, it’s not, and I think this is the big thing for creative professionals, and the biggest thing, if you want to get out of your job, if you want to actually make a living as an author or as a creative professional, you have to think about this other side of things, and if you have an agent or a publisher, and you just leave it to other people, things may well get out of control, and there’s been a lot of cases of people losing control of their money.</p>
<p>Harper Lee, with “To Kill a Mockingbird” is the saddest thing: her <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-03/-to-kill-a-mockingbird-author-files-suit-over-copyright.html">suing her agent after 50 years</a>, the only book that she ever wrote, this masterpiece, and she’s at her age having to sue someone. So, I think if people don’t look after their own business, you can lose touch with all of that.</p>
<p>And the other thing is that if you think about it at a basic level, <strong>creating a business is one of the most creative things you can do</strong>.</p>
<p>I work with eleven other professionals in my work, I collaborate with other authors—creating a business, creating wealth, creating something new in the world is just fantastic. And so I think when people use the word ‘business,’ it can bring up pinstripe suits and things in the brain, but actually, <strong>it’s all the exciting things about creating value from ideas, which is essentially what an entrepreneur is</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>So I am trying to reframe this as ‘the most creative thing you can do is to be a businessperson’!</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Well, you’re preaching to the converted here; Everyone’s at their own stage of this journey, so I really wanted to bring this up right at the beginning, for those of you who are thinking, “I want to do my own thing, but maybe it’s not even that I don’t like the idea of doing business, but I’m not even sure I could do it.” That, for me, was a huge thing at the beginning, just having the confidence to think that I could do the business stuff.</p>
<p>Also, there is a very author-specific version of the question which is the authors who say, “Well, I like the idea of self-publishing, it sounds great, but it also sounds like a lot of work. I would rather just have a publisher who does all the business stuff for me; all the marketing, all the distribution, and I just write my books.”</p>
<p><strong>What would you say to an author who’s coming from that place? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Well, the world has changed quite a lot to what it used to be, and for one, a lot of publishers want authors who already have books that have been edited professionally; they want authors who already have a marketing platform, maybe a blog, an email list; they want authors who are already in a network with other professionals. So you may well have had to start building all of this stuff already.</p>
<p>You and I know, building a website at the beginning can be very daunting, in the same way as writing a book, at the beginning, can be very daunting, but over time, these things grow. So it’s definitely a journey.</p>
<h3><strong>But even if you get a publisher, let’s just take the basics. You still have to think about income!</strong></h3>
<p>Authors often just assume that as soon as you get an agent or a publishing deal, the money just starts rolling in. Yes, you laugh, I laugh. But realistically, there are lots of things about that, for example, most advances, if you get an advance, are split into percentages, so you might get one on signing, one on when the manuscript is finalized, and one on publication, which could be two years later! And then that’s split between all different kinds of people. So, even just doing the basic math, if you have a publisher, is something you need to think about.</p>
<p><strong>And then things like caring about your contracts. </strong></p>
<p>For example, I have a terrible example of a friend of mine who signed a contract in New Zealand for full worldwide rights, all formats, and they only ended up publishing her book in New Zealand, in print format, and I’m like, “But you signed away everything and they’re not even going to exploit all of those rights.”</p>
<p>I think what I’m trying to do with this book, and in general, is trying to educate authors and creatives to think about how much their work is worth, and then think about all the stages of the journey, which also, for us go for the rest of our lives. So, having to think about the longer-term ramifications of signing away the rights, for your whole life. I mean, you’ve got kids, right? Your kids can benefit from your books. That’s amazing! But only if you set it up right. I know this topic’s kind of not sexy, but it’s so important!</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Well, it is if you get it right, yes: it is sexy if you get it right, and if you get it wrong, then it’s profoundly unsexy.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Yes, we’re the ones rolling in the Cristal!</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> I think for anybody who’s watching the video version, we might have to edit the Cristal in.</p>
<p>Alright, so that’s the big picture of the whys.</p>
<h3><strong>Maybe you could actually tell us a bit about your journey from writer to author-entrepreneur? </strong></h3>
<p><strong>And talk about what prompted you, what motivated you to go on that journey, and how you found it. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> I did Theology at university, which is a kind of random degree, and then I became an IT consultant: really, you know, a mismatch immediately! And I then spent 13 years working as an IT consultant, implementing accounts payable into large corporates: possibly one of the most boring things you could ever do! But very well-paid; I traveled a lot, traveled around Europe and the US and the Asia-Pacific, so I had this kind of great traveling life, but my daily work was a) boring and b) kind of soul-destroying for somebody who had thought when they were younger I was creative, and every day this was bogging me down.</p>
<h3><strong>So, I spent 13 years trying to escape my job! </strong></h3>
<p>And I tried various things: I ran a scuba diving business in New Zealand, and I did property investment, and none of that worked for me. And I just couldn&#8217;t figure out, how did I end up with a house and a husband and a car, and a great job, good money—all the things you’re meant to want in life, and not be happy.</p>
<p>So, I started to write a book, I started to read a lot of self-help, and then write self-help for myself. This was 2006. And essentially, that first book, I wrote it, and then I started to learn about the publishing industry, discovered how long it would take to get a book deal, decided <strong>I was not interested in waiting, or asking permission to do anything;</strong> I started to learn about self-publishing, started blogging, and that kind of started me on the journey of writing. So, at that point, I was a writer.</p>
<p>But just going back, like you say, about the mindset: back in 2006, I had an affirmation, which was “I am an author, I am creative,” and I couldn’t even say, “I am creative” out loud, back then. I couldn’t even say it, because I did not believe it.</p>
<p>To say,<a title="from affirmation to reality" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2011/09/12/creative-author/" target="_blank"> “I am an author” as an affirmation</a>, I couldn’t even imagine it at that point. I started off saying it in my head, and then eventually, I managed to say it out loud, and that was a mindset shift that started me into starting a blog, starting The Creative Penn, which at the time seemed really, really arrogant!</p>
<p>And then, from there, it’s pretty much been I’ve just written more books. And then I had another shift in 2009, when I did a <a title="tom evans writers block" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2009/06/25/podcast-tom-evans-writers-block/" target="_blank">podcast interview with a friend, Tom Evans, about writer’s block</a>, and I said something like, “I could never write fiction,” and he said, “Well, why not?” and I said, “Well, I would have to write <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544176561/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0544176561&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=IRGK3MZ2NTFIETCOhttp://"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-20890" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-05-at-3.47.12-pm-198x300.jpg" alt="the name of the rose" width="198" height="300" /></a>something like <a title="the name of the rose" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544176561/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0544176561&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=IRGK3MZ2NTFIETCO" target="_blank">Umberto Eco’s ‘The Name of the Rose</a>,’ or it would have to win, the Pulitzer Prize, because I went to Oxford, my mum’s an English literature professor: I can only write that kind of book and be acceptable.” And he really changed my mind, and then I went on to start writing thrillers, and then here I am now!</p>
<p>So it’s kind of a crazy journey, but I wanted to point out the number of years: we’re in 2014, so this is six years from my first book, and I guess eight years since I had that affirmation.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Right, so it doesn’t happen overnight, it’s like writing a book itself.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Exactly, it really is. And I want to stress that this book, “Business for Authors,” contains everything I’ve learned from 13 years as a business consultant and 6 years as an author, and for most people, if you’re at the point of saying, “I want to write a book,” and that’s as far as you are, you haven’t written your first book yet, there’s a whole lot of things to be thinking about, before you have a business. But I hope that some people will actually want to do this as a career now, because it is viable, that’s what’s so exciting now: <strong>it is a viable business now, to be an author.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Mark: So you were learning your craft as a writer, at what stage did you say, “OK, but I need to start building a business around this”? Did you do one then the other, or did you do them more in tandem?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> I learned about blogging, you and I both know Copyblogger, and I was reading blogs like that. I think that’s when I first came across you: I think I did one of your courses that you did with, Brian Clark, and met people like Johnny B. Truant, who now is also a fiction author. It’s this crazy space we’re in.</p>
<p>But I started learning about blogging, and I thought, “OK, I’m going to become a blogger,” because I knew I wanted to get out of my day job, so I thought, “I’ll be a blogger, I’ll write non-fiction books, and I’ll be a professional speaker.” So I started to train up as a professional speaker and started speaking for income. So I knew I was going to get out of my day job somehow: I knew I could not implement any more accounts payable systems!</p>
<p>So, I had this goal of getting out of my day job, but I started writing fiction, and I started selling courses to authors, so I did sort of veer into the non-fiction, blogging, professional speaking angle, then I started writing fiction.</p>
<p>I left my day job three years ago, September 2011, and at that point, I was making probably 90% of my income—which was a lot less than as an IT consultant—from non-fiction, professional speaking, and blogging-related courses. But then in the last couple of years, I’ve been writing more and more fiction, my income split has really shifted, so it’s now up to about 45% fiction income, and still professional speaking, <a title="self publishing revolution stockholm" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/09/21/self-publishing-revolution/" target="_blank">I’ve been in Stockholm</a> recently, I’m off to Frankfurt next week, so that’s still a big part of it. And then I also still blog, I podcast.</p>
<h3><strong>So like yourself, this is why I use the word ‘entrepreneur’: most people in our space don’t have just one income stream. </strong></h3>
<p>If they did, that would be like a day job! I really don’t believe in having one income stream, I think it’s super-dangerous.</p>
<p>So that’s kind of where I am now, and even if I end up 100% fiction, I still have lots of different books—and non-fiction, I suppose—and also I sell on all the different platforms as well as from my own website. So, basically, my business now is a kind of conglomeration of all of these different things, to make up a very good full-time income.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> I’d like to pick up on what you said just now about it’s now a viable career to be an author, because as well as your own personal journey over these past few years, there’s been big changes in the whole publishing industry. And I can relate to what you’re saying. I mean, I started off, in terms of the writing aspect to my business, blogging was a big part of that. And I was offered several book deals by publishers, and I always looked at it and thought, “How can I afford to write that?” because the terms on offer were just so unenticing. But, of course, in those days, you would write a book as a business card in order to generate money for income. But my blog was kind of doing that for me.</p>
<p>But it’s really through your enthusiasm and C.J.’s as well, the whole self-publishing revolution got up to the point where I realized, “Oh, OK, now I can write a book.”</p>
<h3><strong>So just maybe talk us through that whole change in the publishing landscape, and critically, why it makes it much more viable to make your money, or a significant part of it, as an author. </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> When I first started doing this, there was no Kindle. This is what’s so crazy. Five years ago, there was no international Kindle; authors couldn’t self-publish onto the Kindle; there wasn’t even such a thing as Kobo, which is really big in Canada and here in England; we couldn’t do audiobooks; we couldn’t do easy print-on-demand. It’s kind of just crazy how things have shifted. You wouldn’t be reading books on your cellphone, whereas now we see them, them everywhere.</p>
<p>So what’s happened with this technology shift, America first, UK, Australia, Canada are the markets that have really moved, and we’re still seeing it, Germany’s just starting to move; we’re still seeing the kind of emergence of this in the rest of the world. But what it’s meant to authors is, you can now self-publish. Now, <strong>I don’t like the term ‘self-publishing,’ I like ‘independent author,’</strong> because, professional self-publishers use other professionals, like professional editors and cover designers, so we don’t do it by ourselves, as such.</p>
<p>But essentially, the financial shift is, instead of like you mentioned getting between 15, well even 7.5 to 20% royalty on, on a book, which is what you would generally get from traditional publishing, you can make 70, seven zero, per cent from Amazon.</p>
<p>So that means, when I sell an ebook at $4.99, I make $4, which is just crazy!</p>
<p>And I can do print-on-demand, for people who don’t know, I upload a couple of pdf files, a cover and my interior, up to Amazon’s <a href="https://www.createspace.com/">CreateSpace</a>, and then if someone goes onto Amazon today, they can order a print book, one copy is printed and sent to them, and if you’re on Amazon Prime in America or the UK, you get it on the same day! It’s just absolutely crazy.</p>
<p>Or if you look for my audiobooks on Audible, they’re there as well, I did a joint venture with a narrator. I’ve also done translation joint ventures.</p>
<h3><strong>So, basically, I’m running a global multimedia empire, as an individual! </strong></h3>
<p>And it’s cost me not very much money, because I pay editors, I pay cover designers, but it’s free to self-publish! I speak to publishers, and they just can’t believe it. They can’t believe what we have now as authors.</p>
<p>I know people listening might be saying, “Oh, but isn’t it a load of crap,?” which is the classic thing, but the main thing is that readers are not stupid.</p>
<h3><strong>Readers will not buy a crap book.</strong></h3>
<p>Reviews will get you, or it just won’t sell at all, or it won’t get noticed, and if people download a sample and it’s not very good, then they’re not going to buy the book. So I don’t think quality is an issue at all, anymore.</p>
<p><strong>So, essentially, the technology has enabled us to get our books out there and make more money per book. </strong></p>
<p>We can also sell direct from our websites if we do blogging and things like you and I do. And the other thing I want to challenge people on is, if you think about the books you love, just hold those in your head, now say who published those books. And I bet you that most people can’t name the publisher of those books.</p>
<h3><strong>Most people don’t shop by publisher: they shop by author name, or they shop by title, because they’re looking for something specific. </strong></h3>
<p>So, if somebody wants to deal with rejection and criticism, they might find your book, because that’s what they’re typing in to Amazon. If they’re looking for how to market a book, they might find my book.</p>
<p>So, people want their questions answered, they want education, they want inspiration, they want escape and entertainment: they’re not necessarily buying by publisher.</p>
<p><strong>The other exciting thing for authors is you get a monthly income</strong>, that actually comes direct to your bank account, and you have cash flow monitoring, because you know how much you’re going to earn, 60 days later. So the business is revolutionized in terms of business.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> I’ll just second that: it is incredible, the tools that are available. If you look at the quality of a CreateSpace paperback, or a Lightning Source, which is another system you can use, if you’ve got a good designer, you need a really good cover, but you can stick that next to a paperback from one of the big five, and I’ve had clients who are designers say, “I didn’t realize it was self-published.”</p>
<p>The flip side of this is that we are being judged next to the offerings from the big five, so as Jo says, if the writing’s not good, if the formatting’s not good, if the cover’s not good, readers are going to move on. But fortunately, anybody listening to this has got high aspirations of professionalism!</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Just to put it another way, I say to people now, “Do you go to a farmer’s market at the weekend, do you buy vegetables? Do you buy clothes from a vintage store or a market, I go to Spitalfields and buy stuff. Do you watch indie documentaries on iTunes? Do you buy your gifts on Etsy or Not on the High Street instead of going to a chain store?”</p>
<h3><strong>What’s happening in the world is that there’s a shift to buying from creators. </strong></h3>
<p><strong>People want to buy local, buy from the author. They want to support creatives directly.</strong></p>
<p>Look at Kickstarter, look at Patreon, which I’m now using for my podcast, people actually want to support creative industries. I put direct sales of my, my fiction on my website, and my non-fiction, only a few months ago, which is odd, considering how long we’ve been selling courses directly from our websites, but to my surprise, people would like to buy my ebooks from my website, because they don’t want to give the money to Amazon or Apple or the middle-men.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0988523108/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0988523108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=AWUPEZQQQBRKOG4G"><img class="alignright wp-image-20891 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-05-at-3.49.47-pm-193x300.jpg" alt="APE" width="193" height="300" /></a>So, it’s so interesting, this shift in the public’s perception of indie and artisan. <a title="APE kawasaki" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0988523108/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0988523108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=AWUPEZQQQBRKOG4G" target="_blank">Guy Kawasaki, he wrote a book called, “Author, Publisher, Entrepreneur,</a>” uses the word ‘<strong>artisanal publishing</strong>,’ that we, that we actually care more, because they are our books, than a big five publisher who publishes millions of books. They don’t really care. But we care, because we’re doing it individually and carefully.</p>
<p>So, I think if you shift it to that way round, it’s like, “Well, of course you want to do it yourself: you’re a creative.”</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> There was a really cool story a few months ago, in fact it might have been on your podcast, Jo. There was some book fair, and they were interviewing teenagers queuing outside, and they said, “Who are you here to see?” and they said, “<a href="http://www.selfpublishingadvice.org/indie-authors-at-bea-2014/">We want to see the indie authors</a>,” because that’s who they wanted to be when they left school. And it’s just so great that it’s now starting to become something to aspire to and there’s a really nice part in the book where you talk about looking at your young cousins, who are very creative, and wanting to inspire them and say, you can choose a creative career if you want to do it, and these are some of the tools to help you do it.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Obviously, we’re not saying that you have to earn loads of money being a creative, but your kids, you would like them to be able to do whatever they want to do in their life, and having a really good income actually really helps!</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> There’s not so many drawbacks as the other way round, at least!</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Exactly, and I really feel this. I think it annoys me, the myth of the starving artist in the garret, and that to be a good writer, you should be poor! It’s kind of a crazy thing.</p>
<p><strong>You and I both live in the abundance mentality of the Internet, and generosity and the ever-growing pie</strong>, and when you start thinking that way around books and writing and creativity, the whole thing, it’s so exciting. Every day I’m just thrilled to be part of this world.</p>
<p>And the indie community is so generous, as well. Everyone’s always sharing what they know, mostly for free or in a $5 ebook.</p>
<p><strong>You can find out what any of us know, there are no secrets, everyone’s helping, it’s a great time to be an author. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> So, let’s suppose we’re sold on that idea and we say, “OK, what do I need to do?” Let’s say I’m starting out. Because another nice thing in the book is you’ve got the <a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/07/08/arc-of-the-indie-author/">arc of the developing author business</a> and what we should focus on at different stages. So let’s say I’m a complete beginner.</p>
<h3><strong>Maybe I’ve written my first book or I’m on the way to getting that done. What are the things I need to be focusing on, on the business side? </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> I think if you haven’t finished the book yet, if you haven’t even got a book out in the world, I would start by finishing the book! I actually think that a lot of people will write one book, but a lot of people will stop at that point and realize that this isn’t what they want to do. Obviously, a lot of people will never even write one book, but you’ve got the bug as well, haven’t you, now.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Well, I’ve just finished my second book, last week, so, yes, I know how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> And I’ve just launched, today, and tomorrow I’m back in the library starting on the next book. This is once you get the bug, but the thing is, you don’t know if you’ve got the bug until you’ve finished the first book.</p>
<p>So I think don’t be too distracted if you haven’t finished even one book yet: that would probably be my main thing. And especially looking at working with editors, getting the basics of finishing a product. I guess probably the main thing to think about when you’re doing this, is if you want to do this as a business later on, you do have to be thinking around marketing stuff: maybe you’ve started a blog, maybe you’re thinking about what you want to do with your business, understanding professional editing, professional design, all of the fundamentals that go into making a book, that’s kind of the important thing. Because that’s going to be your primary product.</p>
<p>And if people listening are not authors, then that’s really the thing for any creative business: you need a product, whether your product is, as you have, coaching, you can’t just start coaching tomorrow, from nothing. That’s the developing the craft and the experience type of thing.</p>
<p>But then I think, once you’ve actually got the book done, then your big challenge is realizing that nobody cares! Do you think that’s right?</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Yes, there’s the great cartoon that Hugh Mcleod did on Gaping Void that is the classic town sign welcoming you to the town, and it says, “<a href="http://gapingvoid.com/2009/09/13/the-nobody-cares-print-for-sale-individually/">Welcome to Nobody Cares, population 6 billion</a>”! And that’s really tough, because when we’ve put all the love and the energy and care into creating something, you look out there and guess what? There’s a load of others who’ve done just the same. So what, now then, the question is, what do I do to actually get people to care?</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Yes, and this is where you realize that you haven’t made a million dollars from one book, and you actually have to learn about marketing. Or, if you’ve been published by a publisher, you generally find that everyone doesn’t celebrate it-</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> You have to learn about marketing!</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Basically you have to learn about marketing! And it’s interesting, when you talk to agents and publishers and you read publishing industry blogs, they say the most disappointed person is the author whose book has been published, 6 weeks after publication, because that initial launch fun has worn off, the book has dropped down the charts, and now the publisher’s moved on to the next author. And that’s it. There’s this disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>And I think there is a psychological shift, you have to go, “OK, so it’s up to me, then</strong>,” regardless of how the book is published, or whatever your business is, “now I have to start to learn marketing.”</p>
<p>And that happened to me when I printed 2,000 copies of my first book, and they sat in my house in Australia! This was before the Kindle, and I didn’t know about print-on-demand. I printed 2,000 copies, and then went, “OK, how do I sell these?” And I ended up putting most of them in the landfill, because I discovered print-on-demand. And, but it was a great lesson: I’ll never forget that one.</p>
<h3><strong>Essentially, at that point, you have to learn about marketing.</strong></h3>
<p>Then you make another decision, there are decision points all the way: do I enjoy this enough that I want to go through it again? Because it’s not just writing the book, it’s then the marketing side. And, like us, you go, “This is marketing, you and me having a chat is marketing.” This is the thing: if you reframe marketing into something fun. Both of us like writing, so we blog, both of us enjoy Twitter, we like going to events, we both speak: these are things that we do, and other people can do, and they are ‘marketing.’</p>
<p><strong>So you have to find the marketing that you enjoy</strong>, and then you essentially can consider what you want to do next. Are you going to go deeper into one genre, are you going to switch, what are you going to do with your creative products that work into some kind of business model?</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> And what are the things I should be looking out for? Let’s assume I’m not making a million dollars with my first book in six weeks. But what are the things I should be tracking that let me know, “OK, I’m going in the right direction,” that what I’m doing now is going to grow the business for the long term.</p>
<h3><strong>What are some of the indicators I should look for? </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Well, I think again, like any small business, you should have a website and an email list sign-up, because what will happen with your first book is, it’s unlikely you’re going to have an email list of lots of people. I mean, everybody starts with zero.</p>
<p>But if you start an email list off the back of your first book, by the time you have your second book, you should have 10, 100, 1,000 people on that list who will be ready for the next book.</p>
<p>So that’s a really sensible thing to do, is <strong>make sure at the back of the first book, it says, “If you enjoyed this, sign up here to get something else for free, and be on my list for your next book.”</strong></p>
<p>That’s one thing to do.</p>
<p>And then the next thing is to <strong>start writing another book</strong>, whatever that is, or, if you’re going to use that as part of your business, create a workshop out of that book, or however you’re going to repackage it. But essentially, as we said at the beginning, one income stream is dangerous: you’re never going to make a living from one product. It just doesn’t happen, at all. So you have to think about what are the other products I’m going to create?</p>
<p>And then in terms of measuring, for fiction writers, we often do measure word count. I don’t think it’s so common within other industries. But I say now, “I measure my life by what I create,” so if I’m not creating regularly–and by creating I mean “Here is a finished book”—then I’m not doing my job properly. So, it’s really tracking that.</p>
<p><strong>You could track word count, you could track chapters by the end of the month or something so you know you’re ticking towards your goal.</strong></p>
<p>And at this point, you probably have another day job or another income stream, because, as I said, it’s not a full-time income.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> I’d like to just reiterate what Jo’s said about the importance of an email list, because if you’re looking around thinking, “Should I blog, should I Tweet, should I have a Facebook page or a podcast,” all of those things are kind of nice if you enjoy them, and they can all be done really effectively, but none of them—certainly in my experience and most people I talk to—will have the impact of an email list. And if you think about your own experience, you don’t see every Facebook update, it’s a stream. You don’t see everything that goes in your Twitter stream. But you probably see just about every email that hits your inbox, and that’s the reason why email is so powerful.</p>
<p>So, <strong>one metric you can start tracking from Day One is “How many subscribers am I getting?” </strong>And even if it’s only the tens, tens or scores, or one, that’s another potential reader for the next book, which is a huge asset that you’re building for the business.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> And the other thing is, we’ve got to think about future-proofing. There are some people who believe you should go all-in on Amazon, but I saw a <a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2013/12/12/amazon-drones-future-proof/">documentary with Jeff Bezos and Charlie Rose, last year, and Jeff said, “Amazon will be disrupted</a>, in the same way that Amazon has disrupted other industries.” It will be disrupted. We’ve just seen the Alibaba IPO come out, and people going, “Ooh, this is new, this is something interesting.”</p>
<p><strong>And I think if you own your website and you pay for hosting, you own your own email list, you own the rights to your products. nobody can take this business away from you</strong>, ever, because you own that stuff.</p>
<p>And if all of this goes wrong, if Facebook disappears, if Amazon disappears, if everything else goes, you’ll still have your products, the rights you own, the website and an email list. S I think I’m a bit gun-shy, because in 2008, 400 of us, including me, got laid off on one day during the global financial crisis, and at the time, that was my one income stream. And when I got laid off—along with everyone else—I swore I would never rely on one thing again!</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Right. So, if there’s one part of this recording that I could highlight with a yellow highlighter, it would be this!</p>
<h3><strong>Build your own assets, folks. </strong></h3>
<p>More product, that is, more books, that’s intellectual property—maybe we can talk about the rights that can come out of that—more your own website, so you’ve got your own property online, and your own mailing list, which gives you a hotline to your own readers. Now, those three things give you the foundation, and when people say to me, “Isn’t it, a bit risky being self-employed?” I say, “Well, no one can sack me!”</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Yes, and if you have an email list, if you create something they want, you can make money from selling people what they want.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> That’s how it works. I know, where we are, both you and I have been doing this a number of years now, and maybe we sound a bit blasé, but at the beginning, we were both scared, and it was difficult, and when I gave up my job to do this full time, there was a big self-esteem drop. People look at you funny and treat you funny when you don’t have a ‘proper job’!</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Again, it’s not Land of Milk and Honey, at least not straight away. Look, no Cristal here! It’s hard work. And it makes sense, obviously, not to be relying on that one book to be paying all the bills to begin with. But the joy of what Jo is describing here is you’re building something.</p>
<h3><strong>You’re building your artistic oeuvre, your body of work. You’re building your mailing list, your intellectual property, your web presence. </strong></h3>
<p>If you do this right and you even just track it: this month compared to last month. If you sold one more book than last month, got one more subscriber than last month, it’s growing.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> I tell people to <a title="measuring achievement by olympic periods" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2012/08/11/measuring-achievement-by-olympics/" target="_blank">measure this in Olympic periods</a>. Because in one year, you can feel like you haven’t really got very far. But if you try and think about like where you were during the London Olympics, and then before that, the Beijing Olympics, and then if you think where you’re going to be during the Rio Olympics, every four years, things can really, really change.</p>
<p>Between Beijing and London, I had become a fiction author, I’d left my job, loads of big shifts had happened over four years. So, people, you can definitely achieve this, if you want this, but it takes time, and it takes effort, consistently.</p>
<p>It’s like diet and exercise. You know what to do but it’s one of those, it’s simple but it’s not easy type of things.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> OK, so back to our imaginary author. She’s written the first book. She’s building the mailing list, she’s getting the first sales, the first reviews of the book, building the next one.</p>
<h3><strong>What’s the next phase of the journey? </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Realistically, the next bit is when you have a couple of books. I think there’s a jump at three, if three is within the same genre, or as you are non-fiction, three to the same audience. If you can sell one, they’re likely to buy two or three. So, there’s a jump at three, there’s a jump at five, and then things become more regular. When you’ve only got one book, some months you might not earn any money at all from that book, but since I’ve had three books, I’ve earned money every month, and since I’ve had five, it’s jumped up.</p>
<p>So, I interview people, and again, this might sound crazy, but there are people who are making very, very good money who have over 15 books. C.J. Lyons would be somebody, in that group. I interviewed <a href="http://www.stevescottsite.com/">Steve Scott</a>, I don’t know if you’ve heard of him?</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Yes, he does non-fiction short books.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> He does non-fiction, yes, and he’s got 42 books! They’re all very short, though: I would say that. But, the thing is, there is a business, <strong>you’ve got to think about your business model.</strong></p>
<p>When you want to go full time, when you’ve got maybe three to five books, you’re really thinking, “Am I going to be able to leave my day job? Can I make this a full-time career?” So you have to make some decisions around what you’re going to do next, and start thinking about your strategy.</p>
<p>So, for example, <strong>getting clear on your brand</strong>: that’s when I really thought about, “OK, I’m going to be J.F. Penn for my thrillers, because I’m not this shiny, happy person all the time, I’m also this dark little twisted thing.</p>
<p>It’s The Shadow: you know all about The Shadow! That’s my shadow side, and so I wanted to split my brand. That was a decision you make when you’ve done a couple of books, because we’re all a work in progress, but it helps to have that.</p>
<p>And then maybe you’re writing a series, maybe you decide, my business model is going to be, like yours is, speaking, coaching, and books are a small part, or like me, I’ve decided I want my speaking to be 20% of my income; I want my books to be 80%. So I’m working towards that.</p>
<h3><strong>Think about scalable income.</strong></h3>
<p>I’m sure you’ve talked about this, but scalable income is you create it once, it can earn you money forever, which is a book, whereas speaking or coaching, you do it and that time is gone.</p>
<p>So, thinking about how your business model’s going to work, and establish your criteria for going full time. That’s what I did, so I had said, “I have to be making this amount of money before I give up my job,” so I went to part-time work, I was doing evenings, weekends, before work, until I was earning x amount. Then I could give up my job, with the knowledge that I would have to go back to it if I couldn’t sustain an income.</p>
<p>So, I think when you’ve got three to five books, you’re really thinking about those types of issues.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Yes. And note, Jo is not saying, “Leap and a net will appear. Quit your job overnight.”</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> No: I’m saying it took me pretty much three years of working part time to do this.</p>
<p>And in fact, I’ll tell this story, because this is really important. Back in 2002-2004, a while back, I’d just got divorced, my first marriage—I’m happily married now!—but at the time, I’d just got divorced, I was miserable, and I quit everything: I sold my house at that time, quit everything in order to write the Great Novel, as you do. Three months later, having written nothing except a few poems, angsty divorce poems, I went back to my day job, full of, “I can’t do this, I could just never do this, this is not me,” my self-esteem crushed. And I didn’t write again for another four or five years.</p>
<h3><strong>So, I would say to people that you do not need to leave your job to write a book. </strong></h3>
<p>In fact, it’s better to &#8220;write at the edges of the day,&#8221; as Toni Morrison said. So, I would get up at 5 and write for an hour before work; in the evenings I would blog and do social networking, at the weekends I would write. I think it’s better to do that, work part time, and only give up your job when you’re really certain, and when you have money coming in.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> That’s a great example, Jo, of what we were talking about right back at the beginning, <strong>the value of the business really is that it will support your creativity</strong>.</p>
<p>At that stage, you didn’t have a business model and the infrastructure around you that would support you, and it’s a pretty soul-crushing experience to go through. So, again, if anybody is thinking that there has to be a fundamental conflict between business and creativity, what we’re describing is that actually, one supports the other.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Oh, definitely, definitely. And, now, even when you’re a full-time creative, you still have to do all the other stuff, so it will always be a mutually supportive kind of side. And, I hope you agree, you can’t be ‘creative’ all hours of the day. You have that well every day, and then, you do something else.</p>
<p>But what I think I would also say to people: remember when I said I couldn’t even say, “I am creative” out loud: I didn’t used to have ideas, and now I’m just overflowing with ideas, and that’s something that happens more and more. It’s like a muscle, isn’t it: you exercise that creative muscle, and over time, and now, I just have lists and lists of books that I’m going to write, and that only happens over time, basically.</p>
<p>So, be easy on yourself, people: be nice to yourself!</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Maybe we could finish up by looking at a later stage in the business. Our imaginary author’s got a few books out, she’s making significant income every month; maybe she’s even left her job.</p>
<h3><strong>What are some of the things that she needs to be doing to really maximize the value of her work, and to accelerate the growth of the business? </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Writing this book helped me shift phase from being a businesswoman and an author to “I am CEO of my creative company,” and you only feel like a CEO when you know what you’re doing, and writing this book helped me understand how it all worked.</p>
<p>So, one, <strong>you want to exploit your rights.</strong></p>
<p>We talked a bit before about one manuscript is an ebook, a print book, an audio book, in English; those three products can be sold all over the world in English, indies can sell in 170 countries now, and I have personally sold in 58 countries. So that’s three products in English multipled by 58.</p>
<p>Then you can start looking at translations, so <a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/self-publishing-translation/">I’m collaborating with seven translators now</a>. I know, it’s going off! I’ve got books in German, Spanish, Italian, I’ve just signed Portuguese for Brazil, Brazilian Portuguese.</p>
<p>All of those are joint venture partnerships, 50-50 royalty splits, so I’m not even paying them up front, which is crazy, because translators are creative people too, and they want to do this stuff. <strong>I really believe that collaboration is the future of, of creative business.</strong></p>
<p>So that’s one thing, taking that one product, if there’s a book, and turning it into multiple income streams. And if you think that I’ve now got 12 books: each of those can become all of those multiple income streams, you can see how this is a valid business model, because it really is endless and limitless how many things you can turn these things into.</p>
<p>So, that’s one thing. And then you have to be <strong>considering things like your processes.</strong></p>
<p>So, when you first self-publish a book, it’s a bit complicated, in the same way as when you first use WordPress as a blogger, it’s a bit complicated. You have to go through the process a few times. So, for me, now, as I said, I have 11 contractors, I have my editors, I have my cover designer, I have a bookkeeper, I’m doing my accounts right now. You have to put your processes in place as you develop your business properly.</p>
<p>Then I have to mention it, because I think it’s really important if you want to expand, is the <strong>production plan</strong>. So the production plan, which you think of in a factory, it’s more like a promise. You can say it’s like a part of your business plan, maybe writing a business plan is a good idea, but a production plan is, “I will be writing this in this month, and therefore I can book my editor for this month, I can book my cover designer. I can see that I’m going to create three products next year, that’s going to give me this type of cash flow.”</p>
<p>When you actually start planning and forecasting and thinking about strategy, these are words that businesspeople use. <strong>I love just the general, “Let’s just be creative and make stuff” attitude, but then you almost need to put on your other hat</strong>, if you want to expand your business.</p>
<p>I think I’m really talking to those people who are ambitious, who want to earn really good money, of which I am one, and I think you are, as well. We come from this side where we don’t see these things as being mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>This is what’s so great—my friends in this industry, many of them are making six and seven figures from their fiction and their books, which to me is truly exciting!</p>
<p>So, I think if you consider those type of things, actually get your financials sorted. I’m amazed at how many creatives don’t have a bookkeeper. I can’t stand entering my receipts into QuickBooks or whatever, so I love paying my bookkeeper.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307886239/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307886239&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=PFSTPRGX7AAMTWXT"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20892 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-05-at-3.53.19-pm-196x300.jpg" alt="good strategy bad strategy" width="196" height="300" /></a>And then, looking at the longer-term view. There’s been a good book recently, “Good Strategy, Bad Strategy,” by a guy called Richard Rumelt, which I really enjoyed, and was basically <strong>strategy is what you don’t do as much as what you do</strong>.</p>
<p>And that really helped me, and I’ve written about it in the book, to say what I have to say no to, because you spend so much time when you’re growing your business saying “yes” all the time, and then suddenly you have to start saying “no” to everything!</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Yes, and it’s really scary when you first start doing it, isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Yes, and I still struggle, and then I regret it later. I’m, “Oh, why did I say yes to that?” and often, you know how it is as a speaker, people will ask you for stuff, and then you’ll be, “Oh, no, why did I do that?” I think this goes in the business plan as well: “What I am,” so for me, I am an author. I’m an author, a speaker and an entrepreneur, and that’s the order they’re in.</p>
<p>So every day, I should be working around my author business, my speaker business is secondary, and the entrepreneur is kind of over-arching, but I used to sell courses, and I’m selling them less and less now, and focusing more on books.</p>
<p>So, knowing what you can say no to is really important as you become the CEO of your creative company.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Excellent. Well, thank you, Jo. I think we’ve covered a lot of ground here, from the little acorn of the first few words of the first book, to this huge, spreading oak tree of your multinational, multimedia empire. And because we’ve been in touch for a few years, and I’ve seen your journey, I’ve seen your business grow, and the catalog grow, it really is inspiring to see this.</p>
<p>And also, the thing I really want to underline is, Jo works insanely hard. Like, really, really hard. There’s a reason why you’ve got, what, 11 books or something?</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Twelve!</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Twelve books in six years. I mean, that’s a pretty impressive production rate. So, thank you for your generosity. Honestly, I heartily recommend the book, and like I said, even if you are not an author, I would recommend you check this out. It’s what, $5? I mean, you will get way more than $5’s value, even if you’re not an author. If you are an author, and you’re serious about making this a career, you really should read it, it’s great. So, presumably it’s on Amazon. Where do people go to get the book; where’s the best place?</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> It’s available now as an ebook on all platforms, as a print book on Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble, and also an audiobook, if you go to <a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/businessbook/">thecreativepenn.com/businessbook</a>, all the links are there.</p>
<p><strong>T</strong>hanks so much for having me, Mark, it was great to talk to you, and you continue to inspire me as a creative businessman, as well!</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Well, thank you, Jo. The other thing I want to point people to is you’ve got a great blog at thecreativepenn.com, and also, Jo’s podcast I listen to every week, and it’s really one of the very best ways of getting to know what’s going on in the publishing industry. You always have amazing guests on, you learn all kinds of stuff. So, again, if you’re really interested in writing, publishing your own books, have a listen to The Creative Penn, and within a few weeks, you will be an expert in the current state of self-publishing.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Ah, well thank you, thanks for having me, Mark!</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> My pleasure. Thanks, everybody!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s been much teeth-gnashing in the indie community in the last month with lots of posts about quitting, about income dropping with <a title="kindle unlimited" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/technology/amazon-offers-all-you-can-eat-books-authors-turn-up-noses.html" target="_blank">Kindle Unlimited</a> and the new <a title="EU tax law" href="http://onemanbandaccounting.co.uk/eu-vat-changes-2015/" target="_blank">EU Tax Law</a>, about this or that changing.</p>
<div id="attachment_20802" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamesjordan/2715059407/"><img class="wp-image-20802" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-02-at-12.25.49-pm-1024x768.jpg" alt="uphill climb" width="400" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The uphill climb. No one promised this would be easy!</p></div>
<p>There&#8217;s also been a rash of super blog posts, and in this article, I want to round a few things up and add my perspective to the mix.</p>
<h2>On the end of the gold rush and the year of the quitter</h2>
<p>Kris Rusch has restarted her excellent <a title="business musings kris rusch" href="http://kriswrites.com/15371-2/#sthash.0ME3unFu.dpbs" target="_blank">Business Rusch posts</a>, so immediately go and read them and subscribe. In her <a title="musings 2014" href="http://kriswrites.com/2014/12/23/business-musings-things-indie-writers-learned-in-2014/" target="_blank">musings on what indie authors learned in 2014</a>, Kris names 2014 as the &#8216;year of the quitter,&#8217; when many authors discovered that writing is hard, publishing is hard and making a living with your writing is hard. <strong>Achieving real success is also difficult</strong>, the gold rush has ended and that there is definitely a mid-list indie.</p>
<p>My take on this is to nod my head in agreement.</p>
<p>I never thought writing was easy, and after 6 years of blogging and creating online, and 3 years of doing this full-time, I know that success is hard. I still haven&#8217;t met my initial goal of matching my income from the day job. But then I was 13 years as a business consultant, and the first 5 years of any new business aren&#8217;t exactly boom years!</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ve never seen a gold rush on my own books</strong>, and I know most of you won&#8217;t have either. It&#8217;s certainly more common with romance writers, or those few who made the 99c jump before others. There will always be those who hit the zeitgeist, but you can&#8217;t count on a lightning bolt or lottery win.</p>

It&#8217;s since been rewritten as Career Change</p></div>
<p>I self-published my first book in early 2008 &#8211; pre Kindle, pre mainstream print on demand. I&#8217;ve self-published fiction and non-fiction and I&#8217;ve seen <strong>a trickle of income that has slowly ticked up</strong> to an average $1500 &#8211; $2000 a month. My highest income month has been around $3500 from book sales. I think that makes me a mid-list indie and I&#8217;m pretty darn happy with that after only 6 years in the business. Many authors have been writing for many more years and make a lot less than that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m grateful for every day I don&#8217;t have to work in a cubicle [cue happy dance!]</p>
<p>All I have done since 2008 is write, put my work out there and build a business online by attempting to offer <strong>education, inspiration and entertainment consistently over time</strong>. It&#8217;s what I intend to keep doing, because I love it!</p>
<p>Change is the only constant and all that. <strong>Luckily, I am a change junkie</strong> and surfing the stormy seas is fun for me. If it&#8217;s not fun for you, then try traditional publishing, or stick to writing for fun. Otherwise, time to adapt.</p>
<p>Things will continue to change in 2015, there will be bumps and bruises, but some things never change for creative entrepreneurs. Here are some principles that will help you survive, whatever the conditions of the market.</p>
<h2>(1) Write what you love for people who love to read that type of thing</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/pedrosimoes7/14524548741/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20805 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-02-at-1.02.55-pm-300x253.jpg" alt="reader" width="300" height="253" /></a>I don&#8217;t do rainbows and kittens and happy endings.</p>
<p><a title="Jf Penn" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/" target="_blank">My books</a> are filled with supernatural power, international locations, explosions and high body count. They are based on my own travels and in-depth research.</p>
<p><strong>My fiction is about good vs evil</strong> &#8211; that&#8217;s the theme that obsesses me. So I will continue to write <a title="what I love to read" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/books-i-love/" target="_blank">what I love to read</a>, and the fact that it doesn&#8217;t sell as well as romance or sci-fi or fantasy isn&#8217;t the point.</p>
<p>Russell Blake had a post on <a title="the new landscape" href="http://russellblake.com/the-new-landscape/" target="_blank">the new landscape of books</a> where he talked about the cheaper price phase being over.</p>
<blockquote><p>That means you need to <strong>up your game</strong>, that suddenly story and craft will matter more, and that simply being cheap, with a homemade cover and lackadaisical or no editing, won’t cut it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, this is not news. It&#8217;s what many of us have always said and always practiced, eschewing the fast money for the <strong>long term quality product that will sell over time and make customers happy.</strong></p>
<p>Blake also says, in his <a title="2015 predictions" href="http://russellblake.com/2015-predictions/" target="_blank">2015 predictions</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<strong>The importance of brand will increase</strong> &#8230; Authors who want to have careers doing something besides chasing the next fad will have to develop a brand in their readers’ minds that’s worth paying for.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s my aim. Grow a list of readers who <a title="books I love" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/books-i-love/" target="_blank">love the books I love</a> and want to read more books in a similar vein. When I find an author I love, I don&#8217;t really care how much the book costs (within reason). I just pre-order immediately a new book is announced. That&#8217;s what I want readers to do with my books. That&#8217;s what you need to do as well.</p>
<p><strong>You will get what you focus on.</strong></p>
<p>If you focus on writing, improving your craft, on learning more about the best practices in the industry, in building relationships, on positive enthusiasm and helping others along the road, you will build a career as an author slowly but surely, and for the long term.</p>
<h2><img class="alignright wp-image-1931 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/istock_000003521720xsmall-300x199.jpg" alt="money" width="300" height="199" />(2) Think global. Think multiple streams of income.</h2>
<p>For anyone concerned about income, this is for you.</p>
<p>Along with many others in 2008, I was laid off from my day job. 400 of us in my department were handed a piece of paper saying goodbye, two weeks pay and that was that.</p>
<p><strong>I swore then that never again would I be dependent on ONE stream of income.</strong></p>
<p>As much as I love Amazon, if sales on one platform is your only stream of income, be concerned. If you have a day job, by all means, stick with one distributor. But if this is your business, being dependent on one retailer means things will eventually get difficult.</p>
<p>But I take this even further for 2015.</p>
<h3>If selling ebooks in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">US</span> is your only stream of income, be worried.</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10794" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/world-300x212.jpg" alt="world" width="300" height="212" />As a UK resident who has lived in many countries around the world, and with family members from Hungary, New Zealand, Nigeria and Canada, I always have an international viewpoint on things.</p>
<p>It makes me crazy when I read blog posts, tweets and comments that focus only on the US market.</p>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s the most mature digital market but there is a HUGE world out there that has barely discovered digital. The rest of the world is the next big growth industry for ebooks.</p>
<h3>Stop being so short-sighted. Think 5 years ahead. 10 years ahead.</h3>
<p>I was talking to someone recently about how many African nations have skipped desktop computers and have gone straight to mobile. The cellphone business is booming in some of the fastest growing economies in the world. Do you want to bet that these people read on their cellphones? I saw the same thing in India. People want to learn, they want to be inspired and entertained. They want to read.</p>
<p>On a more personal level, I spoke in <a title="self publishing revolution stockholm" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/09/21/self-publishing-revolution/" target="_blank">Stockholm in September</a>. They haven&#8217;t even got Amazon yet, let alone</p>
<div id="attachment_20808" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-20808" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-02-at-1.09.57-pm-225x300.jpg" alt="auckland" width="225" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Rangitoto Island from Kohi Beach, Auckland, New Zealand. From my Dec 2014 trip.</p></div>
<p>KDP or other ways to publish. The Swedish authors and book reading audience are raring to go!</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I spoke in Auckland, New Zealand at the first cross-genre indie author event. The blog posts and tweets afterwards expressed excitement at finally finding a like-minded community in a country that still has $35 print book prices and a restricted literary culture.</p>
<p>I also gave my 9 year old nephew (also in NZ) some money for Christmas books. He said to me, <em>&#8220;I love reading print, Auntie Jo, but I can get four times as many ebooks for the price of one print book so I will buy them on the tablet instead.&#8221;</em> He also uses an iPad for school.</p>
<p>Yes, <a title="NZ as test market" href="http://www.rebekahcampbell.com/2013/09/10/why-new-zealand-is-the-perfect-place-to-startup/" target="_blank">NZ is a small market but it&#8217;s used as a test market</a> for a lot of new technology for the English speaking world so it&#8217;s worth watching.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-19741 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/KoboWritingLifeSalesAug2014-300x194.jpg" alt="KoboWritingLifeSalesAug2014" width="300" height="194" /></p>
<p>My book royalty income 18 months ago was mainly concentrated on sales from the US, UK, Australia and Canadian stores. Now, my books sell in 62 countries and my income streams from smaller markets grow every month.</p>
<p>I am SO super-excited about the growth in the global market. I hope you can be too.</p>
<h3>Create multiple streams of income from your books</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve gone into this model before, but <a title="know your rights" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/01/07/know-your-rights/" target="_blank">read this post </a>if you need a refresher. Your income streams can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Print</strong> &#8211; print on demand through Createspace or IngramSpark</li>
<li><strong>Ebook</strong> &#8211; by distributor e.g. Amazon, iBooks, Kobo, NOOK, Google Play, Smashwords/Draft2Digital for subscription models and smaller vendors</li>
<li><strong>Audiobook</strong> &#8211; ACX.com for US and UK authors. Other options for authors in other countries &#8211; see <a title="making tracks" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B0KL54O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00B0KL54O&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20" target="_blank">Making Tracks by J Daniel Sawyer</a> and <a title="audiobooks for indies" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/12/13/audiobooks-simon-whistler/" target="_blank">Audiobooks for Indies by Simon Whistler</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/01/07/know-your-rights/"><img class="alignright wp-image-17779 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/RightsSmaller-300x220.png" alt="your rights" width="300" height="220" /></a>Multiply these formats by country.</strong> So I am selling in 62. How many are you selling in?</p>
<p><strong>Multiple these formats by language</strong> if you are getting into translations. I have German, Spanish and Italian and the moment, for print and ebook, with my first German audiobook coming in 2015, along with Portuguese and more in Spanish and Italian. <a title="translation" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/self-publishing-translation/" target="_blank">More on translation here</a>.</p>
<h3>Think wider. How can you create more income streams from your books?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently read and highly recommend <a title="money master the game" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476757801/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1476757801&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=2ODVJH5W6EGC33DL" target="_blank">Tony Robbins&#8217; new book, Money: Master the Game</a>. In it, Tony discusses the All-Season investing approach which anticipates the various market changes that inevitably occur in economic cycles. The idea to to have your investments in different quadrants so you can weather any type of market. The same approach can apply to our creative businesses.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476757801/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1476757801&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=2ODVJH5W6EGC33DL"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20558 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-19-at-2.47.10-pm-200x300.jpg" alt="money tony robbins" width="200" height="300" /></a>If you only have one product (or one book) and one market (or one distributor), you won&#8217;t be able to weather the changes will HAVE to occur, since status quo is never an option. I&#8217;ve always taken this approach to my business and will continue to diversify in 2015.</p>
<p>My business card and email signature say: <strong>Author Entrepreneur</strong>. I do not make a full-time income from books. It could be a full-time income if I lived somewhere else, but I live in central London! You can see <a title="3 years author entrepreneur" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/09/12/lessons-learned-from-3-years-as-an-author-entrepreneur/" target="_blank">my last income analysis here</a> if you&#8217;re interested in the split.</p>
<p>In my experience, unless you are one of the very few making hard core cash from writing alone, <strong>you either need a &#8216;day job,&#8217; or you need to make income from other sources</strong>. I love writing books, but I don&#8217;t want to lose the love by forcing myself into a crazy production process.</p>
<p><strong>My muse loves research and travel</strong> and that adds to my creation time. I&#8217;m happy with that, but I don&#8217;t want to go back to the day job, so while I write books at a reasonable clip, I also have other streams of income.</p>
<h2>Multimedia courses, merchandise and affiliate income</h2>
<p>Many non-fiction authors offer <strong>multi-media courses</strong> through sites like <a title="clickbank" href="http://www.clickbank.com/" target="_blank">ClickBank</a> or <a title="udemy" href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">Udemy</a>. The <a title="write publish repeat conversations" href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=jFa0TXZ1zHw&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fwrite-publish-repeat-conversations%2F" target="_blank">Self-Publishing Podcast guys are now doing this for Write, Publish, Repeat</a>, as is J Thorn, with his <a title="manuscript in 60 days" href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=jFa0TXZ1zHw&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fmanuscriptin60days%2F" target="_blank">Finishing a manuscript in 60 days course</a>. I have been selling courses for the last 4 years but have recently moved away from them to focus on more evergreen products that don&#8217;t need updating. I may revisit that decision at some point.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/i_destroyed_literary_culture_white_lettering_tshirt-235733161320280048"><img class="alignright wp-image-20797 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-02-at-10.09.19-am-300x239.jpg" alt="t-shirt" width="300" height="239" /></a>Some authors are also doing <strong>merchandise</strong>. My favorite example is comic creator and author, <a title="xkcd" href="http://xkcd.com/" target="_blank">XKCD</a>, since my husband has been a fan for years and has lots of his t-shirts. Hugh McLeod has a similar model at GapingVoid with <a title="gaping void art" href="http://www.gapingvoidart.com/" target="_blank">Motivational Art for Smart People</a> &#8211; brilliant branding!</p>
<p>Lawyer and indie commentary blog, <a title="the passive voice" href="http://www.thepassivevoice.com/" target="_blank">The Passive Voice</a>, now has a <a title="pithy tshirts" href="http://www.zazzle.com/dpvan1234" target="_blank">good selection of pithy t-shirts</a> as well. I&#8217;ve had a look at Zazzle before and have thought about a &#8216;creative&#8217; range &#8211; this is something I am certainly considering but the quality needs to be good.<em> [I&#8217;d love to hear about other merchandising examples or service providers that you think are good for authors. Please do leave a comment below.]</em></p>
<p>If you have a content-rich website with decent traffic, you can make an income stream through<strong> affiliate links</strong>, which is a commission payment on sales. I have a small income stream from this method, but I am scrupulous about only recommending things I both use and am happy to recommend.</p>
<p>Currently, I <a href="http://learnscrivenerfast.com/?hop=creativep"><img class="alignleft wp-image-18877 size-full" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Ad18-250x250.jpg" alt="Ad18-250x250" width="250" height="250" /></a>recommend the <a title="learn scrivener fast" href="http://learnscrivenerfast.com/?hop=creativep" target="_blank">Learn Scrivener Fast training</a>, Joel Friedlander&#8217;s <a title="book design templates" href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=239841&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=52997" target="_blank">Book Design Templates</a>, Jim Kukral&#8217;s <a title="author marketing club" href="http://bit.ly/14yzSPt" target="_blank">Author Marketing Club</a> and I use Amazon affiliate links for books. If you want to look at the affiliate method in detail, I recommend <a title="smart passive income" href="http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/" target="_blank">Pat Flynn&#8217;s Smart Passive Income blog</a>.</p>
<h2>Professional speaking and audiobook narration</h2>
<p>One of my other primary income streams is <strong>professional speaking</strong>, which also feeds my travel junkie soul. I&#8217;ve written extensively about this in my book, <a title="public speaking" href="http://viewbook.at/speaking" target="_blank">Public Speaking for Authors, Creatives and Other Introverts</a>, if you want to look into that as an option.</p>
<p>In 2015, I will be adding another income stream from <strong>audiobook narration</strong>. I&#8217;ve been podcasting for 5 years now and after narrating my own non-fiction books, I&#8217;ll be opening up for royalty share deals with other authors with decent platforms. Audiobook income has been a revelation for me in 2014, and I believe this is a growth market so I want to be involved. I also LOVE the royalty split deals as it means ongoing revenue for the long term, which is what we all want.</p>

You can also <a title="audiobooks for indies" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/12/13/audiobooks-simon-whistler/" target="_blank">listen to the interview with him here on this topic</a>, including the moment I decided to become a narrator!</p>
<p>There are many other creative ways to make money from your skills, from your books and your knowledge. But in the end, it all comes down to creativity. I love all these other ways to make a living but I&#8217;m an author first, so I want to &#8230;</p>
<h2>(3) Write something magnificent</h2>
<p>This quote from Penelope Trunk caught my eye in a <a title="workplace revolution" href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2014/12/27/2014-was-the-end-of-the-workplace-revolution/" target="_blank">post about workplace revolution</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I want to be writing the ideas people read late at night, with a glass of wine, to dull the searing impact of the life they’ve already chosen.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, I write for those people who are still stuck in the cubicle jobs that I once was. For those people who cry with frustration and unhappiness as I used to. For those who spend their commute plotting escape and their lunch hours reading escapist fiction to get out of their heads for an hour or two.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jbuc/3877351951"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20812 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-02-at-1.31.48-pm-300x201.jpg" alt="create" width="300" height="201" /></a>On my wall I have a sign that says, &#8216;<strong>Create a body of work I am proud of.</strong>&#8216;</p>
<p>Yes, I want to make a good living but I don&#8217;t want to write books that are a waste of my time and yours. I want you to wake up thinking about something I have written.</p>
<p>I want to keep you up all night.</p>
<p>I want you to remember me when I die.</p>
<p>I hope we can all do this in 2015! Happy writing and all the best for your creative business this year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After wrestling with <a title="letting go of self censorship" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/11/20/writing-fiction-shadow/" target="_blank">letting go of self-censorship</a> in 2014, I am ready to embrace the ups and downs of the creative process in 2015. As Dean Wesley Smith says, &#8220;<a title="dare to be bad" href="http://www.deanwesleysmith.com/the-new-world-of-writing-dare-to-be-bad/" target="_blank">Dare to be bad</a>,&#8221; and something good will come out of it!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/silkegb/2633237471/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20698" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2014-12-02-at-1.51.19-pm-1024x661.jpg" alt="colors" width="400" height="258" /></a>I feel as if my basic process and business model is now (finally) set, and now all I have to do is repeat it in order to develop my craft and grow the business. <a title="know your rights" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/01/07/know-your-rights/" target="_blank">This is the magic of intellectual property!</a></p>
<p>Essentially, the model is: <strong>trust emergence</strong> and continue to feed the muse in order to write (which for me involves travel and research), turn those ideas into books, turn that one book into multiple products, distribute globally and reach readers through marketing, and then repeat.</p>
<h3>Oh yes, and have a great life along the way!</h3>
<p>That&#8217;s important, as if you&#8217;re not loving this, then you&#8217;re better off getting a &#8216;real&#8217; job. No one said this was easy after all, and there are much easier ways of making a living. But if you love it, there&#8217;s no better life!</p>
<p>I find all the aspects of being indie fun, so my focus now is more on creativity and the craft of writing to make the books better, and speeding up the various parts of the process, while still enjoying the journey. Here&#8217;s how that translates into my goals for 2015.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/seeminglee/3882941631/"><img class="alignright wp-image-20764 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2014-12-31-at-7.15.03-am-300x287.jpg" alt="notebooks" width="300" height="287" /></a>Creating new things in the world!</h2>
<p>This is what it&#8217;s all about! I measure my life by what I create now and although this is a list of &#8216;production,&#8217; my focus this year will be on deepening creative practice as well. That&#8217;s just not so measurable, and goals generally need to be measurable <img src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>6 books out in 2015.</strong> A combination of novels, novellas and non-fiction, all in ebook, print and audiobook formats. Three more ARKANE books, Deviance in the London Psychic series plus a minor character spinoff and two books in a new supernatural series. This should turn into 18+ products once each book is turned into the various formats.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Narrate my own non-fiction audiobooks</strong> and publish them on Audible. I&#8217;m also looking at doing royalty split deals with other non-fiction authors and getting into ACX as a narrator as well as an author. Like anyone, I used to hate my voice, but after 4 years of podcasting, I am pretty used to it now and I get so many emails from people who like to listen to it. Narration of other people&#8217;s non-fiction books on a royalty split deal will add another income stream as well, so I will announce availability after I get my own 4 non-fiction books done first.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Translations:</strong> While this is not a primary focus, I do have Portuguese underway for Pentecost as Brazil is likely to be the next emerging market for digital. I also have How to Market a Book coming in German, as well as Prophecy and Desecration in Spanish, so I&#8217;m certainly carrying on, but not expanding too much. I am only one person and it showed this year! I will be doing a review of the translation stuff with sales data in Feb/March once I have a bit more historical information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foreign rights.</strong> I actually want to sell more rights rather than exploit them myself. The translation stuff takes a lot more effort than expected, so I won&#8217;t be doing so much of that in 2015. I have various things bubbling around foreign rights sales, and expect to get into this more in 2015.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Filling the creative well, education and creative habits</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn how to edit audiobooks</strong> for Audible/ACX quality in order to produce my own non-fiction audiobooks. <a title="audiobooks for indies" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/12/13/audiobooks-simon-whistler/" target="_blank">See the interview with Simon Whistler </a>for help on this and his great book, <a title="audiobooks for indies" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PW8TNX0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00PW8TNX0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=WPNVV7HYIWMKB4CX" target="_blank">Audiobooks for Indies</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Robert McKee Genre &amp; TV writing days in London, Fall 2015 for more story focus. I learned so much from McKee&#8217;s STORY conference that I am keen to build on that.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Continue to do courses by Dean Wesley Smith &amp; Kris Rusch to <strong>improve my craft and writing business</strong> &#8211; you can find out <a title="dean wesley smith courses" href="http://www.deanwesleysmith.com/online-workshops/" target="_blank">more on them here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Travel more for research and fun!</strong> Traveling feeds my muse and gives me story ideas for my fiction, so I need more of it in 2015 &#8230;</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_20762" style="width: 222px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dullhunk/8385768077/"><img class="wp-image-20762 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2014-12-31-at-7.02.27-am-212x300.jpg" alt="alarm clock" width="212" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">No social media, no internet &#8230; it&#8217;s just an alarm clock!</p></div>
<p>I also feel that I need to change up my creative routines and habits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No apps or email before lunchtime.</strong> I&#8217;ve had over a year of not using email on my phone &#8211; but I have ended up checking other things e.g. Guardian app for news, Twitter, RSS feeds and other things. I sometimes check it in the morning when I am still in bed as I use my phone as an alarm. It&#8217;s hard to resist &#8220;just checking a few things&#8221;! I have bought an <strong>old-fashioned alarm clock</strong> &#8211; shock horror, it only tells the time and has an alarm function with one ring tone! The mornings are for creativity, writing first draft stuff, walking with my husband and I&#8217;m also starting with Headspace for (once again) attempting to incorporate meditation in my life.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Community</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Continue to blog and podcast at The Creative Penn</strong> for another year, as well as continuing to share useful information on Twitter @thecreativepenn. My aim is to provide graduate level education and inspiration for the indie author community. I&#8217;m not going anywhere so I hope you&#8217;ll stick around for another year <img src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></li>
<li>I&#8217;m also intending to do more Q&amp;A videos, so check out <a title="youtube thecreativepenn" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thecreativepenn" target="_blank">my YouTube channel here</a> if you like vids.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ll continue to try and answer all my email, but I won&#8217;t be answering basic questions like &#8220;how do I self-publish&#8221; and &#8220;how can I sell more books,&#8221; as I have all the free <a title="resources" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/resources/" target="_blank">resources here</a> to help people. If you have a more nuanced question, feel free to <a title="contact me" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/contact/" target="_blank">contact me!</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Be an active member of the <a title="alliance of independent authors" href="http://allianceindependentauthors.org/?affid=88" target="_blank">Alliance of Independent Authors</a>, co-hosting the monthly Q&amp;A show with Orna Ross and contributing to the discussion, promoting quality in the indie community.</li>
<li>Be an active member of <a title="ITW" href="http://thrillerwriters.org/" target="_blank">International Thriller Writers</a>, writing for the Big Thrill and organizing UK events</li>
</ul>
<h2>Income</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/59937401@N07/5857148161/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-20767" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2014-12-31-at-7.34.34-am-225x300.jpg" alt="piggy bank" width="225" height="300" /></a>The big change for me in 2015 is the shift away from online education and courses to <strong>income from books and live professional speaking, </strong>as well as affiliate income and sponsorship. Fiction is evergreen and never needs updating (and super fun!) &#8211; whereas I have found that courses constantly need updates and non-fiction needs at least annual updates. There are also pretty much zero customer service issues with fiction! (I&#8217;m not counting fan email which is a pleasure, not &#8216;service&#8217;)</p>
<p>I was intending to withdraw my courses in 2015 anyway, but the <a title="eu vat law change" href="http://onemanbandaccounting.co.uk/eu-vat-changes-2015/" target="_blank">EU VAT law change </a>for digital products pushed me to do this by Dec 31 2014, so that income stream is now over. I need to replace it, as that has been a significant portion since I left the day job. I&#8217;m not writing off doing online education again, but it&#8217;s not a priority.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ramp up <strong>diversified income streams</strong> for my books. I&#8217;m already publishing direct on Amazon, Kobo, iBooks and NOOKPress. I am just returning to publishing through Smashwords for subscription and other minor sites. I&#8217;m finally going to get into Google Play in early 2015. Financially, I want to have my first 5 figure month in 2015. That&#8217;s a stretch goal but I am putting it out there <img src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Move into <strong>audiobook narration</strong> for my own non-fiction as well as other people&#8217;s books. The royalty split options in ACX mean this is potentially a good ongoing income stream and I believe in audio as a growth market. This will be a new income stream, albeit a slow growing one.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Continue to speak internationally for travel and income reasons.</strong> I&#8217;ve already been booked for <a title="Pubsense Charleston" href="http://www.pubsensesummit.com/announcing-2015-pubsense-summit/" target="_blank">PubSense in Charleston, South Carolina</a> in March, as well as the Shetland Islands and Orkney, which must count as travel! You can <a title="speaking" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/speaking/" target="_blank">find my speaking page here</a> if you want to see me live or book me for an event.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Here we are again! The year rushes by and we stand at the end wondering what we achieved in the last 12 months!</h3>
<p>This is one of the reasons I love blogging – the passing of time is actually trackable. We all change, our goals change, but at least by writing out what we want to achieve and then measuring that, we can keep ourselves heading in the right direction!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I set out to do this year <a title="creative goals 2014" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/01/01/creative-goals-2014/" target="_blank">as documented on 1 Jan 2014</a>, and what I managed to achieve:</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/books/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20684" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/NewBooks2014.jpg" alt="New Books 2014" width="300" height="449" /></a>(1a) Stick with Plan A: Write more books and attract more readers</h2>
<p>I didn&#8217;t quite create as many new books as I intended, but here&#8217;s what I did publish in 2014</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="public speaking" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/speakingbook/" target="_blank">Public Speaking for Authors, creatives and other introverts.</a> In ebook and print formats.</li>
<li><a title="day of the vikings" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/vikings/" target="_blank">Day of the Vikings. </a>ARKANE #5. In ebook, print and audiobook formats. I&#8217;m also giving this away for <a title="free book" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/freebook/" target="_blank">free on JFPenn.com </a>at the moment if you want to try it.</li>
<li><a title="delirium" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/delirium/" target="_blank">Delirium, London Psychic Book 2</a>. In ebook, print and audiobook formats.</li>
<li><a title="business for authors" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/businessbook/" target="_blank">Business for Authors: How to be an Author Entrepreneur.</a> In ebook, print and audiobook formats.</li>
<li>Updated Second Edition of <a title="how to market a book" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/howtomarketabook/" target="_blank">How to Market a Book</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jfpenn.com/gates-of-hell/"><img class="alignright wp-image-20691 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/keyfinal1-186x300.jpg" alt="gates of hell" width="186" height="300" /></a>I also finished <a title="gates of hell" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/gates-of-hell/" target="_blank"><em>Gates of Hell</em></a>, it&#8217;s on pre-order right now, publishing 5 Jan in ebook formats and coming soon in print and audiobook.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have done quite a bit of research and networking on the screenplay side of things, but I will be leaving that until 2016 as well. I want to write a screenplay but because it&#8217;s such a new skill, I&#8217;ll be waiting until I am more settled with my fiction production process.</p>
<h2>(1b) Become a better writer</h2>
<p>The focus on the craft is ongoing of course, but this year I have done a couple of things to invest in becoming a better writer:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Thrillerfest" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/07/17/writing-thrillerfest-2014/" target="_blank">Masterclass at Thrillerfest with David Morrell</a> &#8211; a fantastic full day on thriller writing specifically.</li>
<li>4 day <a title="McKee STORY" href="http://mckeestory.com/" target="_blank">STORY conference with Robert McKee </a></li>
<li>Courses with Dean Wesley Smith and Kristine Rusch on productivity, which has included &#8216;getting out of my own way.&#8217; Necessary for someone who still has problems with self-censorship.</li>
<li>And I have found the right editor, <a title="Adian Editing" href="http://www.adianediting.com/" target="_blank">Jen Blood</a>, who both gets my writing style and kicks my ass when I need it. Jen also happens to write <a title="Jen Blood" href="http://jenblood.com/" target="_blank">great thrillers</a> <img src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Working with Jen has enabled me to learn more about effective story structure and improve my craft.</li>
</ul>
<h2>(2) Exploit more rights and focus on global territories</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/self-publishing-translation/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20682" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Translations2014.jpg" alt="Translations2014" width="280" height="427" /></a>I do now have an agent specifically for foreign rights but this year I went into joint venture deals with translators. You can <a title="self publishing translation" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/self-publishing-translation/" target="_blank">read all the articles and interviews here</a>.</p>
<p>As part of 50:50% royalty split, I published the following books. Desecration-Verletzung was published by Ullstein-Midnight for digital rights and we retain print and audiobook rights.</p>
<ul>
<li>GERMAN: <a title="pentecost german" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/pentecost-deutsch/" target="_blank">Pentecost, Ein ARKANE thriller</a> in ebook and print; <a title="german desecration verletzung" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/desecration-verletzung/" target="_blank">Desecration-Verletzung</a> in ebook and print</li>
<li>SPANISH: <a title="pentecostes" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/pentecostes/" target="_blank">Pentecostés</a> in ebook and print</li>
<li>ITALIAN: <a title="Profanazione" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/profanazione/" target="_blank">Profanazione</a> in ebook and print</li>
</ul>
<p>If you read any of these languages and would like a review copy, please <a title="contact joanna penn" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/contact/" target="_blank">contact me</a> <img src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.jfpenn.com/audio/"><img class="alignright wp-image-19037 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ThrillersOnAudiobook-300x226.jpg" alt="ThrillersOnAudiobook" width="300" height="226" /></a>In terms of audiobook rights, ACX expanded into the UK in April 2014 and so <a title="jf penn audiobooks" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/audio/" target="_blank">all my fiction is now available in audio format</a>, and I will be getting into the non-fiction in 2015.</p>
<p>This has added a great new income stream to the business, and I urge you to consider audiobooks if you haven&#8217;t done so already.</p>
<p><strong>So even though I &#8216;only&#8217; wrote 4 new individual books, I actually produced 19 new products</strong> for my author business, each bringing in a new income stream. This is the magic of publishing and intellectual property rights, and if the penny hasn&#8217;t dropped for you on this yet, <a title="know your rights" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/01/07/know-your-rights/" target="_blank">read this post</a>.</p>
<h2>(3) Professional speaking</h2>
<div id="attachment_20121" style="width: 281px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-20121 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-21-at-8.47.32-am-271x300.jpg" alt="Joanna Penn speaking" width="271" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Joanna Penn speaking passionately in Stockholm. Photo Credit: Petra Rolinec, www.8tiesbaby.com</p></div>
<p>My aim was to develop my speaking in 2014 and take it further than before. Things have definitely shifted as because of demand, I have had to decline a number of events. I love to help people but events have to serve one of two other purposes now: revenue or expenses paid international travel, and preferably both of these!</p>
<p>In 2014, I have spoken internationally in New York on a Thrillerfest panel, Toronto at Kobo HQ, Stockholm, Sweden for an event on self-publishing, Frankfurt Book Fair and Auckland, New Zealand. I&#8217;ve also spoken at a number of events in the UK, plus I&#8217;ve also run my own full day events on book marketing as well as how to make a living from your writing, which I hope to repeat in 2015.</p>
<h2>(4) Focus more on creative entrepreneurship on the blog, podcast and YouTube channel</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve definitely shifted focus this year, posting regularly on the creative entrepreneurship side of things, to go alongside my own development and the writing of Business for Authors book.</p>
<p>You can find a <a title="author entrepreneur" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/entrepreneur/" target="_blank">roundup of the entrepreneurial posts here</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to <a title="fighting overwhelm" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/04/24/fighting-overwhelm/" target="_blank">remove guest posts in April</a>, and am really happy with that decision because it focuses the blog on my personal take on the fast-changing indie world, and I continue to share other people&#8217;s thoughts through the podcast and interviews.</p>
<p><a title="The Creative Penn podcast" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">The Creative Penn podcast</a><a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/podcasts/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-16835" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/CreativePennPodcastButton_240x240.jpg" alt="creative penn podcast" width="200" height="200" /></a> hit 200 episodes, you can listen to the <a title="reinvention 200" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/11/01/reinvention-special-200/" target="_blank">round-up episode here</a>. I have two corporate sponsors in <a title="99 designs" href="http://www.99designs.com/joanna/" target="_blank">99 Designs</a> and <a title="kobo writing life" href="http://kobowritinglife.com/" target="_blank">Kobo Writing Life</a>, but now you, the listener, can also <a title="patreon joanna penn" href="http://www.patreon.com/thecreativepenn" target="_blank">sponsor the show through Patreon</a>. Thanks to all the <a title="Patrons of The Creative Penn" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/patrons/" target="_blank">patrons of the show, listed here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/03/17/deadly-dozen-nytimes/"><img class="alignright wp-image-18670 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NYTimesDeadlyDozen130314-300x257.png" alt="NYTimes Deadly Dozen130314" width="300" height="257" /></a>In terms of collaboration, I was part of The Twelve, a thriller writer&#8217;s collective, and in March 2014, <a title="deadly dozen" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/03/17/deadly-dozen-nytimes/" target="_blank">we made the New York Times and USA Today bestseller lists, selling over 100,000 copies of our boxset, Deadly Dozen</a>. Very cool <img src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>I was also in a couple of other box-sets – The Indie PowerPack, Thrill Ride and <a title="dark trinity" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ONG04CQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00ONG04CQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=HNRQM32Z5G6R5XT6" target="_blank">Dark Trinity</a> – and will continue to look for collaboration opportunities in 2015.</p>
<p>Overall, I feel that 2014 has been a pivotal year in my creative career and I&#8217;ve stepped up a rung on the ladder in terms of my professionalism as an author, and in my maturity as a writer and creative entrepreneur. I am certain this is what I want to do with my life &#8211; it&#8217;s now about developing my craft and developing my business over time. And of course, loving the journey!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m ready to step it up again in 2015 &#8211; I hope you will join me!</p>
<h3> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>OK, that&#8217;s me. I&#8217;d love to hear what you&#8217;ve achieved in 2014, whether that&#8217;s finishing your first book, selling your work, or anything at all. We need to celebrate the good times! </strong></span></h3>

<p>This is another must read from Kris, whose business books for authors are fantastic. It will help you if you have any issues with finishing or self-doubt and will help you reflect on what READERS want, instead of what writers and editors want.</p>

<p>I read Tony Robbins&#8217; self-help books when I was trying to change my life in 2006/2007 and his message of empowerment is the driver behind my own optimism and pursuit of the dream. In fact, I started professional speaking because I wanted to BE the next Tony Robbins &#8211; I&#8217;d like to think I am one of the inspirational voices in the indie movement at least!</p>
<p>This book on money is his first book in 20+ years and his decision to research and write it was sparked by the generally inept way that governments have dealt with the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis. This is a massive book, but it will truly help you take control of your finances. I&#8217;ve been reading it slowly since it came out in November and intend to make a plan to implement its advice in 2015. As author-entrepreneurs, we care about money: we want to make it and use it to help our families and others as well as have a good life. This book will help. It&#8217;s not an easy read despite the word &#8216;simple&#8217; in the title, but some of the aspects inside may have a huge impact on your future quality of life. It&#8217;s worth investing the time.</p>
<h2>Fiction I&#8217;ve enjoyed this year</h2>
<p>I like my stories pretty dark, so these won&#8217;t be everyone&#8217;s cup of tea <img src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> For more of the fiction I enjoy reading, check my <a title="books I love" href="http://www.jfpenn.com/books-i-love/" target="_blank">list of books I love here</a> or check out my<a title="Goodreads Joanna Penn" href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2460248.Joanna_Penn" target="_blank"> reading list on Goodreads</a>.</p>

<p>Secret service agent Ethan Burke arrives in Wayward Pines, Idaho, with a clear mission: locate and recover two federal agents who went missing in the bucolic town one month earlier. But within minutes of his arrival, Ethan is involved in a violent accident. He comes to in a hospital, with no ID, no cell phone, and no briefcase. The medical staff seems friendly enough, but something feels…off. Each step closer to the truth takes Ethan further from the world he thought he knew, from the man he thought he was, until he must face a horrifying fact—he may never get out of Wayward Pines alive.</p>
<p>When the twist comes in this book, you won&#8217;t be able to stop reading the rest of the series. Will soon be a TV show, so read the book before you know what happens!</p>

<p>An unlikely trio must form an alliance to save a kidnapped young girl and untangle a nefarious plot that reaches back decades.</p>
<p>Daniele Barbo, the genius webmaster and creator of Carnivia, has never let the government access his servers, and finding the missing girl is not his problem. But then secrets from Italy’s dark wartime past begin to surface—revelations that could put them all in danger. To save his own skin, Daniel must decide how far he’s willing to let them in.</p>
<p>Brings Venice to life from a really interesting perspective, with great characters and I love the Carnivia website world.</p>

<p>Reporters Daniel &#8220;Diggs&#8221; Diggins and Erin Solomon travel to Kentucky to look into the bizarre ritual murder of one of Diggs&#8217; oldest friends. But that single death is hardly the only bizarre occurrence in Justice: soon, power outages, explosions, standoffs, and conspiracy rock the small town, and fundamentalist preacher Jesup T. Barnel claims he knows the reason for the madness: The end times are upon them, and judgment comes fast and furious as the clock winds down.</p>
<p>I like my thrillers with a religious edge, and Jen&#8217;s books deliver this every time.</p>

It’s a blood feud she didn’t start but she is going to finish.</p>
<p>Beatrix has already crossed one name off her Kill List. Her second target is a mercenary being held hostage by Somali terrorists. Can she infiltrate the most dangerous failed state on the planet and scrub him off the List, too?</p>

<p>This is not a zombie book. This is a different sort of tale. It is a story about the unfortunate, about those who did not get away. It is a human story at its rotten heart. It is the reason we can&#8217;t stop obsessing about these creatures, in whom we see all too much of ourselves.</p>
<p>The book Hugh doesn&#8217;t want you to read! This is definitely very dark &#8211; you have been warned. I don&#8217;t read many zombie books but this one is more about free will, or lack of it. Will make you think &#8211; but don&#8217;t read after eating too much Xmas pud.</p>

<p>When novelist Owen Quine goes missing, his wife calls in private detective Cormoran Strike.</p>
<p>When Quine is found brutally murdered under bizarre circumstances, it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer, a killer unlike any Strike has encountered before&#8230;</p>
<p>Full of observations about the media and publishing industry, which of course, JK Rowling knows all about! I love Cormoran and his sidekick Robin, a fantastic new series.</p>

<p>The brilliants changed everything.</p>
<p>Since 1980, 1% of the world has been born with gifts we’d only dreamed of. The ability to sense a person’s most intimate secrets, or predict the stock market, or move virtually unseen. For thirty years the world has struggled with a growing divide between the exceptional&#8230;and the rest of us.</p>
<p>Now a terrorist network led by brilliants has crippled three cities. Supermarket shelves stand empty. 911 calls go unanswered. Fanatics are burning people alive.</p>
<p>Technothriller-ish with a touch of sci-fi.</p>

<p>Jack Sigler, Callsign: King, has been a lot of things in his life. A soldier, a father, a hero. But now he’s taking up a new title: guardian. After a life fighting billionaire madmen, terrorists and unnatural threats, he’s stuck thousands of years in the past, using his knowledge of history and modern warfare to right wrongs and stand up for those in need.</p>
<p>When he meets a twelve year old boy—the prince of the Babylonian Empire—who is to be sacrificed to the ancient goddess, Tiamat, by a twisted High Priest, King steps in, sword swinging. But what starts as a simple snatch and grab, quickly turns into a pitched battle against a legion of men and hideous creatures. As Tiamat rises from her ancient resting place, the fate of the world—and King’s future—is at stake.</p>
<p>If you want pure escapist fun, Robinson always delivers! Plus, I have a degree in Theology and studied the ancient Babylonians so this was interesting from another perspective.</p>
<h2>Oh yes, and here are the books I&#8217;ve published this year, in case you&#8217;d like to try one of these!</h2>
<h2>Day of the Vikings</h2>
<h4><em>A ritual murder on a remote island under the shifting skies of the aurora borealis. </em><em>A staff of power that can summon Ragnarok, the Viking apocalypse.</em></h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K49B3X0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00K49B3X0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=3ZKWZTZUTVQ2VFUO"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1155" src="http://www.jfpenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/VikingsSmall.jpg" alt="Day of the Vikings" width="191" height="287" /></a>When Neo-Viking terrorists invade the British Museum in London to reclaim the staff of Skara Brae, ARKANE agent Dr. Morgan Sierra is trapped in the building along with hostages under mortal threat.</p>
<p>As the slaughter begins, Morgan works alongside psychic Blake Daniel to discern the past of the staff, dating back to islands invaded by the Vikings generations ago.</p>
<p><em>Can Morgan and Blake uncover the truth before Ragnarok is unleashed, consuming all in its wake?</em></p>
<p>Day of the Vikings is a fast-paced, action adventure thriller set in the British Museum, the British Library and the islands of Orkney, Lindisfarne and Iona. Set in the present day, it resonates with the history and myth of the Vikings.</p>
<p>Day of the Vikings features Dr. Morgan Sierra from the ARKANE thrillers, and Blake Daniel from the London Mysteries, but it is also a stand-alone novella that can be read and enjoyed separately.</p>

When a prominent psychiatrist is found murdered in the old hospital of Bedlam, Detective Sergeant Jamie Brooke finds herself investigating the history of madness to fathom the motive. Blake Daniel, a reluctant psychic, helps her to research the case, only to discover that his own family are entwined with the shadowy forces that seek to control the minds of the mad.</p>
<p>As the body count rises, and those she loves are threatened, Jamie discovers that the tendrils of conspiracy wind themselves into the very heart of the British government. Can she stop the killer before madness takes its ultimate revenge?</p>
<p>A thriller with an edge of the supernatural, Delirium is a story of love for family, revenge for injustice and the question of whether we all sit on the spectrum of madness somewhere.</p>

<p><a href="http://pressbooks.com/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20709 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-04-at-2.02.43-pm-268x300.jpg" alt="hugh mcguire" width="268" height="300" /></a>Hugh McGuire is an author, professional speaker and publishing expert, the founder of <a href="http://pressbooks.com" target="_blank">PressBooks</a>, an online book publishing platform built on WordPress, and of <a href="http://librivox.org" target="_blank">LibriVox.org</a>, the largest library of free, public domain audiobooks in the world as well as lots of other things!</p>
<p><strong>Audio has been a big shift in 2014</strong>, with ACX opening up to UK authors and a big growth in the audio market. We discuss the popularity of audio and why it might be growing. Hugh mentions how the success of his company <a title="Iambik" href="http://www.iambik.com/" target="_blank">Iambik </a>was in the genre fiction categories, which is the same with ebooks. It&#8217;s still a niche market but worth looking at to extend your rights. As with any content, marketing is still really important to make a dent, although I point out that <strong>discoverability might be easier in audio</strong>, because there are fewer titles. The more channels you&#8217;re in, the more formats you&#8217;re in, the more likely you are to build a long-term business.</p>
<h2>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly fine to have a writing career that isn&#8217;t a business, but don&#8217;t complain when you don&#8217;t make any money at it.&#8221; Hugh McGuire, Pressbooks</h2>
<ul>
<li> We discuss <strong>exclusivity, Kindle Unlimited and subscription models</strong>. Authors have to decide what makes business sense in the short term as well as the long term. It makes sense for new authors to use exclusivity to get some movement, but if you have a longer term business model, a wider base of distribution is better. <strong>Subscription models</strong> are not designed to make money from one individual book, it&#8217;s more of a way to grow the amount people are reading altogether. These models are growing. You will always be better off growing your own email list so you can always reach people directly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discoverability and how some of the publishing startups looked like a great idea</strong>, but haven&#8217;t worked out quite yet! Hugh talks about how the self-containment of the e-reading eco-systems have stopped discoverability. We talk about <a title="readmill app" href="https://gigaom.com/2014/03/28/dropbox-acquires-and-absorbs-reading-app-readmill-app-will-be-shut-down/" target="_blank">Readmill</a>, which focused on social reading and was bought by Dropbox and shut down. We both liked <a title="small demons" href="http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-small-demons-to-close-unless-buyer-appears-20131106-story.html" target="_blank">Small Demons</a>, which looked at the cultural milieu around books e.g. what music is referenced within certain books and discovering other books that also mention that song. Unfortunately, they also went out of business. [Side note: I did ask them at a conference why they didn&#8217;t open up to indie authors so we could create content for them, but they only wanted to work with trad pub. I still like the idea!] We also talk about <a title="wattpad" href="http://www.wattpad.com" target="_blank">Wattpad</a>, which is a great startup that is thriving, although its user base may be quite different to mainstream publishing at the moment. And of course, we still love <a title="smashwords" href="http://www.smashwords.com/" target="_blank">Smashwords</a>, and Mark has always focused on indies!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a title="Pressbooks" href="http://pressbooks.com/" target="_blank">Pressbooks</a><a href="http://pressbooks.com/" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-20710 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-04-at-2.03.40-pm-300x87.jpg" alt="pressbooks" width="300" height="87" /></a> is based on producing beautiful print on demand files easily from your manuscript and the interface is built on WordPress so it&#8217;s easy for bloggers to use. There are multiple ebook outputs as well, but it&#8217;s focused on the print on demand aspect primarily. We discuss <strong>the importance of print to the market but how more print sales will go online over time</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global market expansion</strong>. We talk about whether the next big thing will come out of another territory. Hugh mentions that African countries are &#8216;skipping&#8217; technology e.g. moving directly to cellphones instead of landlines, and to mobile tech instead of desktops or laptops. There&#8217;s also fantastic innovation coming out of these other markets. English language authors do have an advantage as we&#8217;ve been thinking about this for several years now &#8211; compare this to French authors or other places where the digital revolution has barely begun.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a title="Author Earnings" href="http://authorearnings.com/" target="_blank">Author Earnings</a> and how supply is increasing. I talk about how my hope is that the romance authors are just ahead of the curve because they started earlier in digital, and that <strong>other genres will catch up in terms of % dominance by indie authors</strong>. In thrillers, it&#8217;s still dominated by trad pub, but we&#8217;re on our way up!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We discuss the fact that <strong>the &#8216;bleeding edge&#8217; of publishing is actually here already!</strong> The self-publishing big names are becoming small presses, publishing other people as H M Ward has now started doing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall, a positive time for creators!</h2>

You can watch below or <a title="paul cameron booktrack" href="http://youtu.be/REQAFhy0Sj8" target="_blank">here on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of our discussion include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People often read in public accompanied by a soundtrack of some kind &#8211; either to shut out ambient noise, or to accompany the story.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Books are (currently) one of the only entertainment choices that doesn&#8217;t have synchronized sound.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Authors often choose soundtracks as they write, and share it with readers. For example, check out the <a title="undercover soundtrack" href="http://mymemoriesofafuturelife.com/category/undercover-soundtrack/" target="_blank">Undercover Soundtrack on Roz Morris&#8217; blog </a></li>
<li>Booktrack takes a <strong>movie style soundtrack and synchronizes it with individual reading speed</strong> via apps. You can create these yourself for free &#8211; and it&#8217;s super fun!</li>
<li>Booktrack has a LOT of music and sound available to use &#8211; you can&#8217;t just use any music because of copyright</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.booktrackclassroom.com/#!/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-20596" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-25-at-3.38.08-pm-300x109.jpg" alt="booktrack classroom" width="300" height="109" /></a>They also have an education side, <a title="booktrack classroom" href="http://www.booktrackclassroom.com/#!/" target="_blank">Booktrack Classroom</a>, where schools are using books to help children engage with texts. <a title="university studies on retention" href="http://info.booktrackclassroom.com/university-studies" target="_blank">Studies show that people retain far more when they read with a soundtrack</a>. It&#8217;s also fun to create, and music means a lot for certain age groups.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I mention how soundtracks on film are designed to <strong>underscore emotional elements</strong>, and no film is complete now without a soundtrack. Booktrack is aiming to get to this point in the future.</li>
<li>Readers can find Booktrack on the app stores or online <a title="booktrack" href="http://www.booktrack.com" target="_blank">Booktrack.com</a> &#8211; it&#8217;s free to use and try at the moment.</li>
<li>The company&#8217;s aim is to become something similar to Audible but without words &#8211; <strong>selling books with soundtracks direct to consumers</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http://www.booktrack.com/#!/?booktrackId=cb3b35953dfd408fa4d4f5cf4541ca96"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-20601" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-25-at-4.27.11-pm-180x300.jpg" alt="budapest booktrack" width="180" height="300" /></a>Marketing and sales with BookTrack</h2>
<p>Book marketing is a constant challenge for us all and one way to <strong>stand out is by having more than just text available</strong>. If you can add sound to your words, it brings another atmospheric dimension to the reading experience, and may be enough to draw people into your book.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to do is to check out a few books. Here&#8217;s my <a title="one day in budapest" href="http://www.booktrack.com/read/cb3b35953dfd408fa4d4f5cf4541ca96" target="_blank">prologue for One Day In Budapest</a>, and <a title="Sand Hugh Howey" href="http://www.booktrack.com/read/73875b0430fd437cac7cbf9ff0bd8687" target="_blank">Hugh Howey&#8217;s Sand</a></p>
<p>You can easily share the Booktracks on social media and email, and coming soon, you&#8217;ll be able to use embeddable widgets on your website.</p>
<p>In terms of monetization, you can add a link to all the platforms where people can buy your book as part of the free aspect of the platform. In 2015, Booktracks will be available for sale, so could provide another revenue stream.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.booktrack.com"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-20597" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-25-at-3.52.47-pm-1024x209.jpg" alt="booktrack" width="600" height="123" /></a></p>
<h2>Five useful tips for using Booktrack</h2>
<p>I asked author <a title="Dawn Grant" href="http://www.dcgrant.co.nz/" target="_blank">D.C.Grant </a>to share her tips for using the service. You can check out her book, <a title="where the flag floats" href="http://www.booktrack.com/read/fcd7cb6876494b33a4b5c4ccf18fc247" target="_blank">Where the flag floats, here on Booktrack</a>.</p>
<p>Dawn also has a book for authors, <a title="booktrack for authors" href="http://www.booktrack.com/#!/bookshelf?booktrackId=339829357ddf499db4684a1c3e04c9fb" target="_blank">The Booktrack Author User Guide</a>, which will help you if you want to do DIY.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.booktrack.com/read/fcd7cb6876494b33a4b5c4ccf18fc247"><img class="alignright wp-image-20612 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-27-at-8.52.44-am-172x300.jpg" alt="flag floats" width="172" height="300" /></a>When you are creating a sound track for your book using Booktrack, it is called booktracking.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Treat booktracking time like writing time</strong> – block off a period of time with no distractions, switch off email/ text message/social media notifications. Also limit or exclude other sounds, or work using a headset so that you can concentrate on the tracks.</li>
<li><strong>Booktrack short sections</strong> at a time. Don’t attempt to do too much all at once.</li>
<li><strong>Keep pen and paper handy</strong>, or a note-taking app like OneNote, to make a note of the tracks that appeal to you as you go through the results of your search criteria. It’ll be a certainty that you won’t remember the track that you liked on page 2 by the time you get to page 6.</li>
<li>If you find the diversity of music tracks overwhelming, <strong>search for a composer whose music suits the genre/theme of your book</strong> and make that your ‘go-to’ composer when choosing tracks. For a showcase of composers and the type of music they produce, use the Booktrack Music Showcase.</li>
<li><strong>Layer your sound</strong> – start with music, then layer on an ambience track and finish with sound effects. Or layer two ambience tracks and then sound effects. Or a music track and two ambience tracks and no sound effects. The choice is up to you. You can layer on as many tracks as you like, but too many and things may get muddled! <strong>Play it back</strong> to make sure it’s not too much and that the sound effects don’t get overwhelmed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Booktracking can appear daunting but there’s no better way to learn that to just jump in and do it! Have a go today.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Simon talks a bit about his background, with a degree in business</strong>, then working in Sri Lanka before moving to Prague. He started narrating audiobooks and working with indie authors, and then started his podcast, Rocking Self Publishing, before deciding to write a book about audiobooks to help authors get their books out there. We talk about the creative hub that Prague is turning into &#8230; We discuss entrepreneurship and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PW8TNX0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00PW8TNX0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=WPNVV7HYIWMKB4CX"><img class="alignright wp-image-20644 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-28-at-5.44.05-pm-196x300.jpg" alt="audiobooks for indies" width="196" height="300" /></a>the mindset shift from writing a book to running a business as an author.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why the audiobook market is growing so fast.</strong> Basically because Amazon is behind it, plus the advance of digital technology. People can consume while they do other things, and it&#8217;s on demand now through wireless technology. It can also help you stand out as there are far fewer books available in audio, plus Whispersync means people can combine editions on their Kindle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On ACX and how it works.</strong> You can also <a title="distributing with acx and marketing audiobooks" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/05/01/audiobooks-acx-marketing/" target="_blank">read more about my experience with ACX in publishing and marketing here</a>. We talk about pricing, ACX bounty, marketing, Whispersync and how the various payments work, as well as how to select a narrator.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best practices for working with a voice talent</strong>. We talk about adaptation, interpretation and respecting creative expression &#8211; as well as balancing it with how you want the book to be.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On fiction and non-fiction audiobooks.</strong> Often listeners want to hear the author read non-fiction, so if you can, narrate it yourself. For fiction, you need to do voices and things, so it&#8217;s best to get a professional. Simon talks about using basic equipment for audiobook narration &#8211; you don&#8217;t need to complicate things and it will only cost you a couple hundred $ to get started. Before you do anything, read your book out loud and see how you feel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Getting over your voice</strong>. We talk about becoming a narrator and how it can become another income stream, on when to take royalty split deals, and more. I am considering getting further into narration in 2015, only for non-fiction though.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On podcasting</strong> and when authors should consider it. We talk about the commitment in time per episode as well as how long it takes to get some traction with an audience. Like writing, it&#8217;s a long term game! We also talk a bit about <strong>video and YouTube</strong> &#8211; the most important thing is regular content. Most successful vloggers are doing videos several times a week. We also mention <a title="skype translator" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJIILew6l28#t=36" target="_blank">Skype Translator</a> &#8211; which translates as you speak &#8211; only in beginning stages, but wow! It&#8217;s like Star Trek!</li>
