		<description><![CDATA[Accept the challenge to read at least 12 books in genres unfamiliar to you in 2015.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The new year</strong> often brings determination to tackle new tasks, to develop new habits and eliminate bad ones.</p>
<p>Writers making a New Year&#8217;s resolution often commit to write X number of words per day or week, complete a scene a day or sit writing at their desks for a set number of hours each day, promise to finish a draft, promise to begin a new story, or even declare that they will submit to five agents every week until one of those agents signs them.</p>
<p>Other writers join writing groups for the first time or sign up for classes in fiction or grammar. Some commit to a course of study on their own, determined to delve deep into the fiction elements and hone their skills.</p>
<p>But my challenge for you this year (at least here at the beginning of the year) has nothing to do with writing and everything to do with reading.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m willing to bet that you&#8217;re a reader, someone who has a favorite genre or two and who is thrilled when a favorite author publishes a new book.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably energized by reading, even if you&#8217;re up until two or three finishing a book.</p>
<p>And not being able to relax with a good book for an extended period of time may even make you cranky</p>
<p>So, reader, I want to challenge you to tackle an endeavor you already enjoy.</p>
<blockquote><p>I challenge you not to read more, but to read more broadly.</p>
<p><strong>Set yourself a goal to read at least a dozen books in 2015 in genres that you don&#8217;t normally read</strong>. That&#8217;s just one book per month. Read a handful of different genres or choose just one or two and learn the peculiarities and rhythms and strengths of genres you&#8217;re unfamiliar with (or genres you&#8217;re convinced that you don&#8217;t like).</p></blockquote>
<p>Read romance if you&#8217;ve never done so before (every story is not the same). Read horror if you&#8217;ve always turned up your nose at it (it&#8217;s not all gory). Read three or four positively reviewed (or classic) literary novels that you&#8217;ve stubbornly refused to read.</p>
<p>Go for futuristic sci-fi if you typically read historicals or try paranormals if you usually read westerns.</p>
<p><strong>Read something different, a</strong>t least 12 books&#8212;more if you&#8217;re game&#8212;that you wouldn&#8217;t normally read.</p>
<p>This is a challenge, so it may be tough. You may have trouble getting through one or two of your choices. Push in a little harder. If you still can&#8217;t finish a book, try something else. You&#8217;ve got a year; can you read 12 books from outside your comfort zone in a year?</p>
<p>I challenge you to try. I encourage you to stay with the challenge until you meet or exceed your goal. I&#8217;ll be pulling for you to not only finish the challenge, but to discover a new genre or author to love.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">_______________________________</p>
<p>Why such a challenge? Why encourage you to attempt something that some will find terrifically easy to complete and others will struggle to get through?</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m suggesting this challenge for the busy writer and editor as a means of broadening your interests and opening your eyes to the variety of writing styles and genres, plot lines and characters, that are available for our reading pleasure.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s so very easy to read the same authors and genres, the same settings and eras. It&#8217;s easy to dig in with the familiar until we&#8217;ve dug down so far, we&#8217;re living in a rut. Or deeper still, in a trench that&#8217;s hard to escape. A trench that limits or distorts our view or keeps us from seeing what else surrounds us.</p>
<p><strong>Read as a means of getting out of that rut</strong>. Ruts can be comfortable, of course they can. But new and different can be exciting. And energizing. And simply fun. And the new and unfamiliar can tease you with ideas that the same old, same old can never provoke.</p>
<p>Reading in new genres can open our eyes to knowledge and experiences we can&#8217;t find in other genres. Unfamiliar genres can challenge our viewpoints and opinions. Reading in unfamiliar genres can simply keep us from growing closed-in on ourselves and our own thoughts and prejudices.</p>
<blockquote><p>Reading in new genres can keep us from going stale, from becoming so set in our ways that we can&#8217;t appreciate anything that departs from the familiar.</p></blockquote>
<p>We can all learn from genres we&#8217;re not familiar with&#8212;<strong>I challenge you to learn something new about the craft of fiction writing simply from reading novels you typically wouldn&#8217;t read</strong>.</p>
<p>Read something new this year, keeping in mind that new for you may mean the classics.</p>
<p>Read a few novels from a bestseller list. I&#8217;m not asking you to tackle the top 100 books of all time, just a dozen (or more if you want a bigger challenge).</p>
<p>Read two or three of the classics you couldn&#8217;t finish in high school.</p>
<p>Read an author from a country different from yours.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability</strong></p>
<p>If you want to commit to read a dozen books outside of your favorite genres and need accountability, leave a note in the comments. We can revisit this article throughout the year to see how you&#8217;re doing. (Yes, a public declaration does help us to complete our pledges.)</p>
<p>If you want to tell us what you&#8217;ve read (or what you plan to read) and whether or not you enjoyed a particular book, that would be great too. Maybe you can recommend a book that surprises you.</p>
<p>Need a list of genres to choose from? I&#8217;ve included a list of the most common genres. Most genres have multiple sub-genres, so if you&#8217;re looking for something such as paranormal mysteries or time-travel historicals, you&#8217;ll be able to find plenty of offerings in that category.

		<description><![CDATA[Explanations for why a work in progress doesn't read like a published novel. Includes areas to work on to improve a WIP.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>A reader recently</strong> asked about a book she was co-writing with a friend&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;">We cannot seem to make it sound like a real published novel.</span><br />
<span style="color: #333399;"> It might just be because it is on the screen. Will it help if it is printed?</span><br />
<span style="color: #333399;"> Also, we need to make it longer. Any ideas other than</span><br />
<span style="color: #333399;"> being more descriptive?</span></p>
<p>There are many, many reasons a work in progress doesn’t sound like a published novel. There are even more if the manuscript is a first effort, the first work of long fiction a writer has tried. While I don’t know if the WIP in question is a first novel, I’m going to answer that question as if it were. But before that, let’s look at the easier questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Will it help if it is printed?</strong></p>
<p>The short answer is probably. We’re still used to reading from paper, and a story may well have a different feel if it’s read away from a computer or other electronic device. I always suggest that writers proof their manuscripts from hard copy, if only to find errors. A story read from a different medium and in a different location from where it was written looks different. And problems sometimes leap from the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Any ideas [about making it longer] other than being more descriptive?</strong></p>
<p>Unless a novel truly lacks description, adding description wouldn’t be my suggestion for lengthening it. A novel that’s too short probably lacks action events and contains too little plot.</p>
<p>It’s likely to be too short because while the writer probably included a solid opening and a good ending, it&#8217;s likely that there&#8217;s not enough story to fill the middle chapters.</p>
<p>Story openings, endings, and the climax often come easily to writers, even if the writers eventually change one or more of them. But they are the exciting moments of a story and therefore are the scenes we focus on when we get an idea for a story.</p>
<p>Yet openings, endings, and a key dramatic scene are only parts of a story. Besides just being there, on the page, they need to be connected by other story elements. They need to be built up to. They need to be foreshadowed.</p>
<p>In addition to these key plot moments, characters need to be introduced and those characters need to reveal themselves over time, over the length of the story.</p>
<p>Characters need to <em>grow</em> over time.</p>
<p>Description&#8212;whether we’re talking setting description or description of characters&#8212;is only a small part of a story. That is, small in terms of page space, not importance. <strong>While description is necessary for many reasons, padding a short story to lengthen it will not likely create a better story</strong>. Exceptions if description is completely lacking, of course. But description cannot make up for a sparse plot or insufficient action scenes.</p>
<p>A short novel may lack depth, so character development may be necessary. This may entail showing characters involved in endeavors other than those that lead directly to the story’s climax. While all story events should be related to the main and/or secondary plot, that relationship may not seem obvious until the later chapters of the novel. So a character may seem to be on a different track until a moment of revelation when readers discover he’s been on a course parallel to the main plot all along.</p>
<p>Making a novel longer, then, likely requires more plot points and maybe additional scenes to show character growth. Items to consider include—</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A longer buildup to events</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Twists and turns so characters don’t arrive at the high and low points too soon</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">More major events</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A subplot featuring secondary characters that eventually dovetails with the main plot</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Real-time dialogue rather than reports of what was said</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Yet, rather than trying to make a novel longer, a writer might have to rethink the entire novel</strong>. If there’s not enough plot to fill a novel, maybe the work would be better as a short story or novella. Maybe the writer should begin again, with a story that includes more events.</p>
<p>Not every idea that sounds like it would make a good novel is destined to become a novel of 90,000 words. <strong>Sometimes a good idea isn&#8217;t sufficient for a full-length nove</strong>l. Sometimes there is simply nowhere for the idea to grow, nothing more to be said.</p>
<p>That possibility should be explored. And then a writer can begin a new story, one with more possibilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________________________________</p>
<p><strong>How to Make a Story Sound Like a Published Novel</strong></p>
<p>As I said at the top of the article, there are many reasons a manuscript might not sound like a published novel.</p>
<p>One reason may be that it’s only a first draft. <strong>Unless you are a genius writer with every writing skill hard-wired into you, your first drafts will never read like published works</strong>.</p>
<p>Published books have been reworked multiple times. The final product is not a first draft; it may be draft number ten. That means scenes have been rewritten, moved, abandoned, rewritten again, and abandoned again.</p>
<p>And remember that cleaning up the grammar, spelling, and punctuation of a first draft does not produce a second draft&#8212;it just creates a cleaner first draft. So be prepared to dig in and rewrite whole scenes. Be prepared to make major changes. Be prepared for draft five to read nothing like the first draft.</p>
<p>When scenes and chapters are rewritten and new text is added while other text is cut out, then we’re talking rewriting. And every novel manuscript needs rewriting. <strong>There’s simply no way to include every element in the right measure and in the right order and with the right words in a first draft</strong>. It’s difficult to cover every issue competently in a second or third draft.</p>
<p>The first reason a WIP or a writer’s first effort doesn&#8217;t sound like a published novel? It’s a first or second draft that needs much more work.</p>
<p>A second reason may be that it hasn&#8217;t been edited, or at least critiqued by someone other than the writer.</p>
<p>We all miss errors and weaknesses in our own writing. No matter how good you are, this is true. A writer isn&#8217;t a master at every writing skill and therefore needs someone else&#8212;maybe several other people&#8212;to help find problem areas. An editor is helpful in this endeavor since he or she can often offer suggestions to strengthen problem areas, but even beta readers with no editing experience can provide help, at least to point out sections in the text where they had problems following the plot or making sense of a character’s motivation. You want beta readers&#8212;not readers who buy your books&#8212;to be the ones to say, “That doesn&#8217;t sound like Max” or “That doesn&#8217;t seem like something Joey would do.”</p>
<p>An editor can help a writer cut out what doesn&#8217;t belong in a story. Writers, especially first-time writers, are often attached to every word, insisting that not even a single one can be changed. On the other hand, professional writers and editors realize that cutting or changing words often strengthens the impact of a scene, and they have no trouble changing words or changing or cutting whole scenes.</p>
<p>My suggestion? <strong>Have someone&#8212;another writer or an editor&#8212;read and/or edit the manuscript.</strong> Maybe simply offer a critique. And then be prepared to listen to and consider what this someone has to say. You don’t have to agree with everything, but you should agree to listen and consider the comments and suggestions. This is one of the hardest activities for a writer working with his first or second manuscript&#8212;no one wants to be told his prized work isn&#8217;t perfect. But every writer should want to make his story the best it can be. And readers who can point out problems&#8212;without having to worry that they’re hurting a writer’s feelings&#8212;are a treasure that writers can’t do without.</p>
<p>As usual, I&#8217;ve written a long article, and I still haven’t included all the reasons a manuscript doesn&#8217;t sound like a published novel. I’ll put other possible reasons in list form. These may not be the only reasons an unpublished story doesn&#8217;t read like a published one, but they point out areas a writer will want to look at when faced with the same question. Other than the first three*, these aren&#8217;t arranged in any rank or order. The first three are possibilities you may want to look at first if your own story seems far from a published novel. They are common problems, especially for first novels.</p>
<p>Any one of these issues or a combination of them could produce a story that doesn&#8217;t sound like a published novel. See if any contribute to problems you’re having with a WIP.</p>
<p><strong>*Report vs. Scenes</strong>. If reports&#8212;long stretches of exposition or summary&#8212;take the place of action that occurs in real time, a manuscript won’t read like a finished novel.</p>
<p>Long paragraphs or pages of reports on what happened, with the narrator filling in the reader, make a piece of fiction sound less like a novel and more like a recitation of facts. Be sure that your manuscript contains scenes that happen in real time and in the presence of your readers. Readers should be able to see and hear events as they play out in the story’s setting. <strong>There should be more scenes than there are sections of narrative summary</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>*Not Enough Plot</strong>. If the plot is thin, your WIP definitely won’t read like a novel.</p>
<p>Novels are layered, with events happening on a variety of levels for different purposes and involving different people. Make sure you have enough plot events&#8212;both major and minor&#8212;plot events that change the direction of the story, and events that evoke different emotions.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that plot events must lead to other events. And they need to be causally related, not independent actions.</p>
<p><strong>*Genre Needs</strong>. If genre conventions and reader expectations are absent, a manuscript won’t sound or feel like other stories in the genre. Be sure to include elements of the genre. That means a murder in the early pages for a mystery, hero and heroine meeting early in the story for a romance, and realistic world-building for sci-fi.</p>
<p><strong>Dialogue</strong>. Dialogue that sounds like conversation rather than dialogue, which should contain only the good stuff, is a problem for a novel. All dialogue should have a point. It should advance the plot, raise the conflict level, or reveal character. Or it should do a combination of these tasks. It should also elicit emotion from the reader and reveal subtext.</p>
<p>Dialogue shouldn’t be a space filler or a time waster. Make every word count.</p>
<p><strong>Back Story</strong>. A story with too much back story on the page, especially at the beginning or at crucial moments, still needs work. Readers want to read about the present moments in the characters’ lives, not about the past.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that you can’t include back story or that it’s not necessary, only that you should be discriminating about what to use and when.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s vital for a writer to know back story in order to write believable characters, but most of that info won’t be conveyed directly to the reader. Back story is often a tool for the writer and shouldn&#8217;t appear on the page in its raw form. Work the details of back story into a scene rather than dropping it in whole as a list or as an info dump.</p></blockquote>
<p>Refrain from putting a character sketch in your story&#8212;there’s seldom a need to provide every detail about a character. Keep that info to yourself and use it to create situations that bring out your characters’ strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong>Explanations</strong>. Too many explanations for why a character does what he does takes the drama out of a story. Explain <em>only</em> when necessary, when readers need a little help.</p>
<p>But assume your readers are smart. They know genre conventions. They’ve read many novels. Assume they can catch on to almost anything you put in front of them.</p>
<p>They don’t need to hear your “voice” talking to them as they’re running from a murderer or trying to save the world alongside the characters.</p>
<p>Allow readers to stay lost in the fiction.</p>
<p><strong>Author Preaching and Intrusion</strong>. Related to the last item is this one: don’t force yourself into your story world. That means the reader shouldn&#8217;t be treated to you preaching, teaching, or explaining. Readers shouldn’t hear or see you at all. If you’re promoting a theory or point of view, hide it within a character. Otherwise, readers will see your hand and will be sucked right out of the fictional world and returned to the real world.</p>
<p><strong>Too Much Description</strong>. Whether it’s details about a story’s setting or description of a character, too much description can have readers skipping sections of a story. If your descriptions sound like pamphlets for cruises or exotic getaways, or you&#8217;ve included a character&#8217;s curriculum vitae, you&#8217;ve included too much.</p>
<p>Use only enough description to allow readers to frame in the characters and the setting. Don’t think you have to describe every character down to the color of their toenails and their favorite foods. Include description that&#8217;s necessary to fill in some blanks, but let the readers use their own imaginations for details that don’t influence the plot or other characters.</p>
<p>Description can be vivid and memorable, but it shouldn’t overwhelm. Think light touch with description.</p>
<p><strong>Play-by-Play</strong>. If you&#8217;ve written a play-by-play of common actions, you&#8217;ve included too much and the story won’t sound like a novel.</p>
<p>There’s no need to include every step a character takes between picking up his keys at his house to arriving at his ex-wife’s office. Readers don’t need to watch him going out the door, locking it, opening his garage door, backing his car out, stopping at every light, finding a parking place, entering the office building, getting into the elevator, getting off the elevator, sharing small talk with the receptionist, and then finally storming into his ex-wife’s office.</p>
<p>Cut to the chase; this is the time for summary. Assume that readers understand how common actions, such as driving, work and skip the common actions.</p>
<p><strong>Give the reader the good stuff</strong>. Omit everything else.</p>
<p><strong>Too Few/Too Many Characters</strong>. Too many characters dropped into a story, especially at the beginning, or too few spread over the length of the story may indicate that the story still needs work.</p>
<p>Use only as many characters as are needed to tell this one story. But don’t skimp. If you need to add another antagonist, do it. Fascinating and involving stories need fascinating characters. Provide enough without giving readers too many to keep track of.</p>
<p><strong>Similar Characters</strong>. Do away with characters too similar to one another. Roll them into one if their actions aren&#8217;t different enough or if readers won’t be able to tell them apart because there’s nothing notable about them.</p>
<p><strong>Repetition</strong>. Too much unintended repetition can make a story less inviting for the reader. Be careful not to repeat words, thoughts, or events.</p>
<p>As I said, readers are smart and they catch on. There&#8217;s no need to inundate them with the same information, even if it&#8217;s packaged in a different way.</p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong>. If a theme is too blatant, as if you’re beating a point into the heads of your readers, a story may sound more like a treatise than a novel. Don’t go heavy-handed with a theme; readers will pick up on theme quickly. They won’t need a lot of references to it.</p>
<p><strong>Obvious Clues</strong>. Treat your readers with respect by not being overly obvious with clues, red herrings, foreshadowing, and hints. Almost every writing element can use a light touch.</p>
<p><strong>Character Motivation</strong>. Insufficient reasons for characters to make a stand or get involved (or not get involved) may make your story suffer in a comparison with published novels.</p>
<p>Published novels provide clear motivation for character actions. Make sure you&#8217;ve included logical motivation for your major characters. But don’t only <em>tell</em> why a character behaves as she does&#8212;show her motivation in action. Let it be clear the type of person she is by what she does.</p>
<p>And make sure the characters are consistent.</p>
<p>Characters can grow, but one character shouldn&#8217;t be Jekyll in one scene and Hyde in the next. Unless, of course, he is a Jekyll and Hyde kind of character.</p>
<p><strong>Give characters sufficient reasons to do what they do</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient Reactions</strong>. Characters should respond to the actions and dialogue of others. If you&#8217;ve included too few reactions, especially of major characters or characters who should have a response, your story will feel off in some way. It will feel off because it <em>is</em> off.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The whole purpose of including story events is so that characters can respond, which leads to more events and then more responses—this is the plot in motion, rolling along and gaining momentum</strong>. But <em>you&#8217;ve</em> got to include character responses to events and to the actions of others. Think reaction for every action. Think reactions that build over time. Think of reactions that eventually explode.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Reactions to Fit the Action</strong>. Reactions should build over the course of the story, but they should fit; not too tepid, not too overwhelming.</p>
<p><strong>Boring Characters</strong>. A story that doesn&#8217;t read like a novel may have too many characters the readers don’t care about. Or maybe the main character is a dud.</p>
<p>Bold and unique characters stand out&#8212;don’t hold back with your characters. Create someone unusual, someone necessary to accomplish what you&#8217;ve asked him or her to do in your story world. Someone memorable. Someone who does what the rest of us only dream of doing.</p>
<p><strong>No Conflict</strong>. A story without conflict isn&#8217;t a novel. It may be a synopsis, but it’s not a novel.</p>
<blockquote><p>Novels need conflict, conflict of every kind and every level involving every character.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you don’t know how to write conflict in fiction, start researching. You won’t be able to write an engrossing novel without it.</p>
<p><strong>Touching Reader Emotions</strong>. Your WIP may be flat, never eliciting reader emotion of any kind. To reach your readers, you&#8217;ve got to move them emotionally. This may mean making them laugh or cry or shiver with fright. You may have them grinding their teeth in anger. Whatever the emotion, a novel needs to produce it in the reader. And it needs to include different types in different amounts as the story progresses.</p>
<blockquote><p>Related to emotion, <strong>readers should feel tension from the conflict between characters. And readers should often be on edge, unsure about what’s coming next</strong>. This is true for every story, not only suspense novels.</p></blockquote>
<p>If your story or individual scenes don&#8217;t move your readers, try working on ways to evoke emotions from them.</p>
<p><strong>Subtlety</strong>. I touched on this one in another of the topics, but remember subtlety as you write. Hint rather than going in heavy-handed. Make the reader work a bit to pull meaning from a line of dialogue or a scene. Make readers have to pay attention. (But don&#8217;t be too cryptic. Again, a light touch is best.)</p>
<p><strong>Grammar and Punctuation</strong>. Poor grammar and punctuation will make any story look amateurish. Bone up on the rules and put them to work for you. A writer can&#8217;t get away with saying, &#8220;I forgot all those rules.&#8221; At least not for long. Not forever. It&#8217;s a writer&#8217;s job to learn how to use his tools and to learn what can be done with those tools. Grammar rules are basic writing tools.</p>
<p><strong>Sentence Construction</strong>. This one goes back to the basics of writing: use variety in sentence and paragraph construction.</p>
<p>There are many ways to arrange words into a sentence, so try several of them with most of your sentences. Change patterns and rhythms. Change formats. Don’t allow every sentence to sound or look the same, with the noun first and the verb following.</p>
<p>Write a long sentence followed by two short ones, a paragraph a page long followed by a single-word paragraph.</p>
<p>Try a different word, a different verb form, a different noun.</p>
<p><strong>Word Choice</strong>. Word choices can direct a story, and changing the words can redirect it. If your manuscript doesn&#8217;t sound right, try new words. Go for a different feel or flavor. Change the common to the unusual.</p>
<p><strong>Think unique. Think about word choices that only these characters in this setting under these particular circumstances would use</strong>.</p>
<p>Word choice can <em>make</em> your story; spend quality time choosing the perfect words.</p>
<blockquote><p>And be sure to pick words that reflect your characters’ education, background, culture, and emotions. When a character finally explodes, even his word choices should reflect his agitation.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Maintaining Point of View</strong>. Many first manuscripts have mixed-up points of view, with POVs that change from scene to scene or even paragraph to paragraph. Changing POV is okay, as long as a writer understands what she’s doing and understands how each POV works. Accidentally changing POV due to lack of knowledge about the different points of view is entirely different. Even changing viewpoint characters willy-nilly can cause major problems in a manuscript.</p>
<p>Make sure you&#8217;ve chosen the best POV and best viewpoint character(s) for your story and then be careful to maintain the POV you chose.</p>
<blockquote><p>Keep in mind that you can always rewrite using a different POV or viewpoint character. Doing so may be the salvation of your story.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Tone and Mood</strong>. When the mood of scenes doesn&#8217;t match either the emotions of the characters or the story events, that can cause a story to feel or sound off.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>A scene’s mood should reflect what’s happening and a character’s reaction to those events</strong>. Make sure that the mood you create with your words and sentence rhythms matches the characters and the story events.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Wrong Opening</strong>. A story that starts in the wrong place has a lot to overcome. Make sure that your story has a strong beginning, one that pulls readers in and tempts them to read on.</p>
<p>Genre should be clear in the opening pages. And genre-related elements should pull in readers that love a particular genre.</p>
<p>An event that catches the reader’s attention while also making characters react is a stronger opening than one that takes three chapters to get to the point.</p>
<blockquote><p>A flashback is usually not the best choice for an opening scene. Telling about your protagonist’s school days or youth is usually not the best choice either.</p>
<p>Capture the reader’s attention in your opening pages. <strong>A tried and true starting place is the moment just before the main character’s life is blown apart by unexpected or unpreventable changes</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Chapter-ending Hooks</strong>. Your story may lack chapter-ending hooks, which is another reason it may not sound like a novel. If you end chapters without giving readers something to anticipate&#8212;something to look forward to or fear or worry about&#8212;you’re not taking advantage of reader curiosity. It&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;re not keeping the reader hooked.</p>
<p>End each chapter in a way that will have readers turning the page to read “just one more chapter.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> ___________________________________</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve included quite a few possible reasons that a manuscript might not sound like a published novel. If any of these issues are unfamiliar to you, I suggest you start studying. Each of these areas (as well as others) should be addressed as you work through your manuscript.</p>
<p><strong>But keep in mind that a first manuscript might <em>never</em> sound like a published book. You may have to treat your first effort as practice, a project never to be published</strong>. The first few novel manuscripts of <em>nearly every writer</em> will end up as practice projects.</p>
<p>And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>Most writers don’t sell their first stories. Not their second or third either. <strong>Writers often don’t have the skills to weave together all the many fiction and story elements in a way that pleases a reader, not when writing that first novel manuscript</strong>. Once a writer realizes this, some of the pressure is off. And that’s a good thing. A great thing. The writer can then begin a second and third manuscript armed with the skills and knowledge he gained while working through the first story.</p>
<p>Give your first story your all, even if you acknowledge that it will be your weakest story&#8212;if you don’t give it everything in you, everything you know to do, you’ll be wasting your time. But don’t expect to publish it. And don’t expect it to sound like a published book. You’re comparing the fifth or eighth or tenth effort of a published author&#8212;<em>a professionally edited book, at that</em>&#8212;with the first or second effort of an unpublished writer, one who’s never been through the editing and rewriting process with an editor or publishing house. That’s not comparing apples to apples. That&#8217;s not even comparing one fruit to another fruit.</p>
<p>By the time a book is out in public, the writer has probably written five or six drafts of that one story. And that’s after writing five or six drafts of three or four or five other manuscripts, stories that never sold. That’s a lot of writing and rewriting. And the writing of those stories probably also involved a lot of studying, a lot of dialogue with a critique group or critique partner, and a lot of input from an editor.</p>
<blockquote><p>A published novel sounds and feels different from a first draft or from the work of a beginning writer because <em>it isn&#8217;t the same animal at all</em>. Even the  first and second drafts of professional novelists won&#8217;t be the same quality as published books because they&#8217;re not at the same stage of production.</p>
<p>A story requires a lot of time and work to become a polished novel. That&#8217;s both the short and the long answer.</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of effort goes into a published book; don’t be discouraged if your current project doesn&#8217;t measure up. Just keep working the craft and delving into your imagination. This is one activity where study and practice, practice, practice <em>will</em> produce positive results.</p>
<p>No, your hard work maybe not result in a publishing contract, at least not right away, but it will help create a better writer. And that&#8217;s a goal worth working toward.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Explore today's news to get inspiration for your fiction. Don't hesitate to use tidbits from and elements of current stories in your own work.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>You may be</strong> a writer who has no trouble coming up with plots and story events, tumbling your characters into one mess after another easily and without too much thought.</p>
<p>But if you have trouble devising believable plots, a perusal of newspaper articles, whether on paper or online, could give you enough ideas to last your entire writing career.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not necessarily talking of stealing an idea in full, enough so that readers would recognize the plot or some of the events. I&#8217;m talking about using as inspiration a kernel of some story. You may not even use the idea for your main plot&#8212;maybe something you read in a newspaper or news magazine is perfect, with a twist or two, for a secondary plot. A piece of back story. The key to a character&#8217;s motivation.</p>
<p>Try reading through some stories online. It&#8217;s likely that one that interests you will lead you to other stories and other information and additional topics that inspire something for a story you&#8217;re working on. Use it. <strong>If a topic or oddity or event catches your attention, it&#8217;s likely to catch the attention of others as well. So take what you read about or discover and put it to work in your fiction</strong>.</p>
<p>But use the tidbit or information in a way that fits your story. That means you might need to change it from its original form. You need the interesting (or unbelievable) event to fit your story&#8217;s genre, setting, characters, and other events. You don&#8217;t want to steal a story whole from the headlines, as some TV shows do, and plop it into a novel and call it your own. But you can certainly let the events of a true story influence you.</p>
<p>You are already influenced by all sorts of real-life people and events&#8212;there&#8217;s no prohibition against using topics from the news to add the feel of reality to your fiction.</p>
<p>News reports have shown us&#8212;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">police killing citizens</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">citizens killing police</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">countries invading their neighbors</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">plane crashes</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">cruise ship illnesses and accidents</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">school shootings</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">kids killing other kids</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">acts of uncommon bravery</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">acts of uncommon cruelty</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">selflessness</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">selfishness</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">parents leaving children in hot cars</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">revenge porn sites</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">discovery of mummified remains in odd places</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">the rise of new political groups</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">wars based on religion</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">killer diseases</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">demonstrations based on race or economic factors</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">hiding of kidnap victims for years</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">computer hacking</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">cities falling into ruin</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">the search for the perfect selfie</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">teenager revealing too much of her personal life online</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">not getting a job/getting fired because of negative Internet presence</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">shoppers killing each other over the last toy, sport shoe, fancy purse</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">the rise (and possibilities) of 3D printing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">wild weather extremes</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">stories that seem true at first glance but which prove untrue after an investigation</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">_________________________________________</p>
<p>Can you see it, a mystery based on the discovery of a mummy in a place no mummy should be found? Or maybe a love story based on the same discovery&#8212;what if the love story took place two thousand years ago and an explorer finds the remains of one of the lovers today and recreates the love story from the clues left behind?</p>
<p>Or the discovery of a mummy could lead to a horror story. A mummy that&#8217;s found and then lost again could make a fun and humorous YA adventure.</p>
<p>So many options out of one news story&#8212;don&#8217;t feel that you can&#8217;t take a snippet from real life and wrap a fictional adventure around it. You can. <strong>You can use any piece of information or news that moves you</strong>. You can use any piece of information and fashion it into fiction.</p>
<p><strong>Make it Real<br />
</strong>When you can&#8217;t come up with either the main plot or some event or issue that you need as an influence for a character&#8217;s motivation or goals or personality, get thee to a newspaper and see if you can&#8217;t find something &#8220;real&#8221; that can be folded into your fiction to flavor it with a touch of authenticity.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t copy events detail by detail, but allow your imagination to grab hold of a real-world event and then add it, like a spice, to your story. Instead of relying on old standards&#8212;plot lines that came from some event so far back that you know nothing about it, but likely something based on a real event or a scientific possibility or fear&#8212;substitute something more modern: cyber crime for a traditional kidnapping, ruining a person&#8217;s reputation via social media rather than killing him, hijacking a plane and hiding it rather than demanding a ransom midflight. Or hide the plane for political purposes. Or merely pretend to hijack and hide it. Maybe you don&#8217;t actually take the plane somewhere, maybe your plane never even leaves the airport. With readers primed (from reading the same news stories you read), they may expect a plane to turn up in some hidden airbase. But if you perform some literary sleight of hand, your plane might be hidden at the same airport from which it supposedly departed on its ill-fated trip.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be shy about taking the influences of the day and working them into your fiction. All ideas come from somewhere&#8212;it really is okay to use real-world events to inspire story events. Do you think all the famous novels from the past came solely from the minds of the writers, with no outside influences whatsoever? It&#8217;s not true. We are all inspired. So take what moves you and use that inspiration to influence your readers. Make them cry or shudder or laugh because they can imagine such events happening. Give readers believable fiction, events that they can almost see and touch.</p>
<p>Writers of historical fiction do this all the time, borrow real-world events for their novels. They may use a complex event or they may simply pick one thin sliver from the real world&#8212;a character related to a famous person, perhaps&#8212;but they bring reality to their fiction in a way that readers recognize and respond to.</p>
<p>You can do the same.</p>
<p>Make it real. And don&#8217;t hesitate to use the real to color your fictional worlds and events.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[When you can't find rules for punctuation or grammar, sometimes simply choosing an option and then being consistent with that choice is all the answer you need.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>While there are</strong> rules for the fiction elements as well as rules for punctuation and grammar, most writers eventually discover that they don’t have to be slaves to the rules in order to create compelling stories.</p>
<p>Yes, glaring errors, especially in plot or spelling or even with punctuation, can ruin a reader’s enjoyment of a novel. But consistency <em>can</em> mitigate errors. Maybe not blatant, in-your-face mistakes, but certainly errors where there’s some leeway or discussion over the rules.</p>
<p>I recently read two novels back to back, one with many more commas than I would have recommended and the other with many fewer commas than I would have said were necessary. The novels were of different genres, but both were written by many-times-published authors.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have recommended much of the comma use for either book, but the writers and editors made their choices work because they were consistent over the length of the novels; the choices made for commas at the beginning of the book were the same choices made for comma use at the end of the story.</p>
<p>And while I noticed the use of extra commas in the one book and the absence of what I’d consider necessary commas in the second book, many readers might have noticed nothing “wrong” with either book. That is, because of internal consistency, the comma choices might not have bothered most readers.</p>
<p>And I’m not saying that I’m a super-discriminating reader. I am saying that since I deal with punctuation rules daily, I note an unusual use of commas. I especially notice them when they’re missing from where the rules say they should be and when they’re overused, found in places where the rules say they’re unnecessary. Still, once I got used to the style choices of both authors, I had no trouble accepting those choices. I admit I did keep noticing them, but since I knew they were deliberate choices, I wasn’t bothered by the unconventional comma use.</p>
<p>I mention these two stories because, while we try to follow suggestions for comma use, <strong>not following the established rules is not always a bad thing or a practice to be shunned</strong>. And perfect rule-keeping isn’t always necessary.</p>
<p>You don’t have to worry that ignorance of one punctuation rule will automatically bar you from publication or be the cause of a manuscript being turned down by agent or publisher. When you don’t know a rule, consistency can be a saving grace.</p>
<p>Don’t do what I did with a story many years ago. I didn’t know a particular rule (and didn’t bother looking up the rule). This was before the Internet, when research was a bit tougher. It was well before I knew what the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> was. I was familiar with APA formatting and didn&#8217;t know that there were other resources recommended for fiction writing. So what did I do when I didn&#8217;t know the rule? I was creative&#8212;I tried every option I could think of, a different one each time the particular punctuation requirement came up. Using every possibility, I figured I’d at least get the punctuation right a portion of the time. I was definitely hedging my bets.</p>
<p>You definitely don&#8217;t want to follow my decision in this. Instead, choose one option and be consistent throughout a manuscript. Who knows? By the time you add the punctuation from beginning to end, one or more sentences might help you determine what punctuation (or grammar rule) you should actually be using. That is, you might recognize a pattern or might realize what the correct option is simply by seeing a particular sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestions to help with unfamiliar or uncertain punctuation and grammar</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Review rules of grammar and punctuation periodically. And go beyond <em>Strunk and White</em>. Read some detailed grammar books.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Try to find rules for odd situations you’re unsure of.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When you can’t find a rule and have to make a decision between options, make the decision and be consistent when the same situation comes up in other places in the manuscript. <strong>Be consistent even if you’re consistently wrong</strong>. Once you know the rule or when your manuscript is accepted by a publisher, making changes will be easier if an error has been treated the same way throughout the manuscript.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Decide not to stress over “wrong” grammar and punctuation in books you&#8217;ve already published. If you self-published and can make changes easily, do so. If you can’t, don’t stress over what can’t be changed. There are errors in every novel&#8212;and there are choices that some would call errors but are truly style choices&#8212;and you can’t let worry about possible errors eat away at you. Learn from the error and move on.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Try to create a clean, error-free manuscript, but don’t delay submissions indefinitely by trying to fix every stray jot and tittle. If you have one or two problem sentences, with grammar or punctuation questions that you can’t answer, that’s no reason not to submit, especially if the problem sentences are in the middle of the manuscript. Even if an agent or publisher asks to see your manuscript based on your submission packet, you’ll have time to research the grammar or punctuation issue more.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you can’t find the answer to a punctuation or grammar problem after researching the issue <em>and</em> the problem is not a major one that affects too much of the story, don’t let the issue keep you from submitting. If you’re self-publishing, you owe it to your readers to check the rules again, of course. But you can’t put off submitting or publishing over a small issue.</p>
<p>In order to create understandable phrases and sentences, it’s to a writer’s advantage to know the rules and the reasons those rules work. <strong>It’s also to the writer’s advantage to know when rule breaking can create effects or unique phrases that <em>make</em> a piece of writing, that mark a writer’s style</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Not every writer will punctuate a sentence tor paragraph the same way. You want to write in a clear manner for the reader, but <strong>you don’t have to follow the same path that every other writer would follow</strong>. As there is more than one way to reach a destination by car, there is more than one way to reach a destination in a novel.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can send the reader via the direct route or send him along the scenic route. You can have him stop at sights along the way. You can send him in daylight, when he can notice details of places and objects on the sides of the road or at night, when he would notice little or nothing.</p>
<p>The point is to get the reader somewhere and give him an entertaining ride. But you don’t have to follow an established path or someone else’s road. You <em>could</em>, but you don’t have to.</p>
<p>Whichever rules you follow, apply them consistently so that the reader doesn’t get lost unless you purposely want her lost. Never lose the reader because you didn’t understand how to use your tools properly. Delightfully lose readers in the emotion of a story, in the complexities of plot or character, but not in a labyrinth of confusing or confused grammar and punctuation.</p>
<p>Allow consistency to not only make a story clear to readers, but to help you as you write. Use consistency as a tool to make good writing even better and problem areas a little less problematic.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Invest as much in books one, two, and ten as you did in book one. That is, don't shortchange books beyond the first one.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Most writers are</strong> nearly obsessive about their first novels. They spend inordinate amounts of time crafting the perfect opening line, the most captivating opening action sequence, a memorable final image.</p>
<p>Writers choose each word of that first effort with care and deliberation, changing and reworking until passages sing or scream or whisper with emotion—whatever it is they are supposed to do.</p>
<p>Writers work out intricate plot details and give characters scintillating dialogue. They know the story setting inside and out.</p>
<p>But by the time the writer has put together three or four mysteries featuring the same detective or has written four or five romances or the fifth story in an open-ended series, the writing can become stale. Common. Uninspired.</p>
<p>I’ve seen it happen more than once, this shift from the search for the perfect word or phrase to the acceptance of the ho-hum, but the practice seems more common to writers putting out books at a fast rate, perhaps in order to satisfy reader demand.</p>
<p>My suggestion is that you not shortchange the stories after the first one. Don’t shortchange any story or the reader, but be especially mindful not to hold back on books and manuscripts after that first one. Each novel (or short story or novella) deserves your best effort. Your best words. The full range of your skills and creativity.</p>
<p>Maybe writing the fifth or sixth novel won’t take as much time since you will have learned new tricks and techniques with subsequent stories. But the elements of good fiction should be found in subsequent books no less than in the first effort.</p>
<blockquote><p>Don’t settle for clichés or even common phrases in your stories. Think about craft, about putting what you know to work for you with every writing project.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don’t skimp on the good stuff just because you’ve got deadlines, especially if the deadlines are self-imposed.</p>
<p>Yes, meet your deadlines and don’t take forever between writing projects—I’m not saying that you shouldn’t meet deadlines. I am saying that if you’re going to skip anything, skip the common and the boring, not the necessary.</p>
<p>Common phrases—not quite clichés but phrases that could fit any story, thus not wording peculiar to <em>your</em> characters and plot—make stories seem familiar to readers. They make readers wonder if they’ve read the story before.</p>
<p>You don’t want readers thinking that your fifth novel sounds just like your fourth and, come to think of it, rather like the third as well. Instead of familiarity, you want readers feeling that each novel is new, with new revelations and adventures, even if the characters and/or setting are the same.</p>
<p>You definitely don’t want readers thinking that your book six sounds like the latest from Author X.</p>
<p>And I’m not referring to similar plot lines or characters, though those could be problems as well.</p>
<p>I’m talking about settling for common phrases again and again without expending the effort to come up with story-specific words.</p>
<p>Don’t tire of being creative. Don’t tire of writing for specific characters undergoing specific dramas and adventures in specific places and times.</p>
<p>Every story deserves your best effort. The readers you expect to buy your books certainly deserve your best.</p>
<p>Consider one of your WIPs—have you been coasting through the creation of it? Have you settled for common actions and descriptions and dialogue, content to just get the story down? Do you plan to accept it as “good enough” even though you know it isn’t your best, certainly not the quality of writing you should be producing?</p>
<p>Let me encourage you to push past the common, to go back to the days when you <em>crafted</em> a story, when you didn’t simply throw one out there. Write a work of high quality. Take your new skills and the tricks you’ve learned to not only write faster, but to write better. Write smarter.</p>
<p>Make your second and third and fourth stories at least as creative as the first. They should definitely be stronger in terms of the mechanics and in terms of the fiction elements.</p>
<p>Don’t hold back. Don’t try to get by. Don’t get tired of pushing toward perfection.</p>
<p>I encourage you to not sleep through the writing of your fifth or sixth or tenth books, assuming that your readers want the same old, same old. Give readers new phrasings, new imagery. Remind them of a character’s background or quirks if you’re writing a series or using recurring characters, but don’t give them the same wording again and again.</p>
<p>Give each adventure its own flavor and high points. Give each its own low points. Give every story a new twist or two. A new approach. A new hook.</p>
<p>Remind yourself that you’re not writing new chapters for the first book, but new chapters for a new book, a book that needs its own style and focus and impact.</p>
<p>Don’t shortchange your stories or your readers. Give each book your complete attention and all your creativity. Write great fiction, whether it’s your first or your twentieth book.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A membership area---to include a member-only forum, DIY lessons, and a once-monthly discussion on writing issues---is coming soon to The Editor's Blog.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I wanted to give everyone</strong> a heads-up about new features coming soon (one very soon) to The Editor&#8217;s Blog.</p>
<p><strong>Membership<br />
</strong><strong>Beginning this week if I can finish the setup, The Editor&#8217;s Blog will include a members-only section</strong>. Nothing will change here in the public areas of the blog&#8212;you&#8217;ll still find new articles on craft, on the mechanics of writing, and on encouragement for those days when you need a push. But I&#8217;m expanding the site to include a member forum, do-it-yourself (DIY) lessons, Fiction Talk&#8212;a once-monthly real-time discussion on craft issues and problem areas&#8212;and even some mini-classes (perhaps quarterly or monthly, depending on interest and scheduling realities). There will be a yearly membership fee for this service.</p>
<p>There will also be an ever-growing resource section, with useful links and information for both writers and editors.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">_________________________________</p>
<p>After the member area gets going, next to come will be books. I&#8217;ve been asked more than once to put together collections of related articles from the blog in book form&#8212;I plan to offer collections (PDFs) on both writing and editing topics. You&#8217;ll be able to purchase the collections, and a select few will be included as free downloads to paid members.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a couple other offerings on tap, but those won&#8217;t be started until after the new year.</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll continue to find what you need for both writing and editing here at The Editor&#8217;s Blog.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">_________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Professional Editors and Proofreaders</strong><br />
I&#8217;m also considering adding a separate forum for editors and proofreaders, a place where we can discuss not only craft, but other issues&#8212;how to approach an edit, the different services an editor could/should provide, techniques for explaining story and technical issues clearly to clients, and even techniques to improve our own skills.</p>
<p>Editors, feel free to leave comments about this issue, but I&#8217;ll be providing a link soon so you can share your comments and questions with me directly. Because membership to a Pro forum would need a filter, expect to be asked to offer confirmation that you&#8217;re a professional (or near professional) editor or proofreader in order to join such a forum.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited. This new service and the resources to be found there should help us all improve our skills.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have comments or questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>
<p>Several of you have asked about pricing. I&#8217;ll include my intended prices as of October 29,2014. These prices <em>may</em> change before registration begins, but I&#8217;m pretty firm about the numbers.</p>
<p>Memberships:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Founding Members</strong>&#8212;$35 for the first year and $50 renewal every year thereafter (until membership lapses or until the site closes, whichever comes first). The Founding Member level is a special offer that will be available for a limited time only&#8212;the first seven (7) days that membership is available.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy Members</strong>&#8212;$50 for the first year, $60 every year thereafter. Legacy Membership will also be available for a limited time&#8212;from the day the Founding Members introductory offer is over until December 31, 2014.</p>
<p><strong>General Membership</strong>&#8212;Beginning January 1, 2015, general membership will be $60 per year. This general membership price is subject to change. (As the membership site accrues resources, it&#8217;s likely the yearly membership fee will reflect the growth in content and value.)</p>
<p>No matter what the membership fee becomes after January 1, 2015, Founding Members will never pay more than $50 per year and Legacy Members will never pay more than $60 per year <em>as long as they don’t let their memberships lapse</em>. If Founding or Legacy members cancel membership or let it lapse and then want to renew, membership will renew at the then-current price (at least $60).</p></blockquote>
<p>Books</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>PDF Collections</strong>&#8212;Collections of related articles will be released as PDF books in the near future. Collections will have different prices, depending on the content, but I&#8217;m aiming for most to be between $3.99 and $6.99.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I haven&#8217;t written</strong> an article of encouragement recently, but since the National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo or NaNo) is next month, I thought I&#8217;d take a few minutes to encourage you to begin a new project, maybe push yourself into trying a new genre or writing style, if only as an exercise and only for 30 days.</p>
<p>I also needed a break from the article on misplaced modifiers I was working on. The examples and explanations were getting a bit tedious, so I figured a break was in order. I&#8217;ll get back to that article sometime later this week.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard of NaNo, but if not, check out the good folks that put on this very public and very fun challenge to write at least 50,000 words toward a new novel in 30 days. They&#8217;re at <a title="NaNo" href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo.org</a>.</p>
<p>There is no financial cost to participate, but there is an investment of time. If you&#8217;ve never written more than a couple hundred words a day, you&#8217;ll be surprised to find that <strong>you need to average 1,667 words a day for the month to &#8220;win&#8221; NaNo</strong>. Other than a badge you can display on your own website or blog, you don&#8217;t actually win anything tangible. But you can earn bragging rights. You may also lay the solid foundations of a new novel. Your efforts may see you break through writer&#8217;s block on another project. You may surprise yourself by succeeding at a genre new to you, maybe succeed at writing scenes in a point of view different from one you normally use or find success with a different narrative tense.</p>
<p>I wholly support NaNo and believe every writer should try it at least once. (I tried three times, but only won the first year. Still, I eventually finished the manuscript I started, my first shot at a genre I&#8217;d never attempted.)</p>
<p>The discipline of writing every day may be very different from your normal writing practice, but that&#8217;s a plus; different approaches produce different results. You <em>can</em> push yourself to write more than 200 or 300 words a day.</p>
<p><strong>Because of the relatively high word count, you&#8217;ll have to turn off your inner editor and censor and simply write, a marvelous way to get into the creative flo</strong>w. If you&#8217;re a deliberate writer, writing one exact word at a time, writing with freedom may not only help you create some very free passages, but the approach may get you out of a rut.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that writing this way will ultimately work for every writer, but it is worth exploring by every writer. It is worth your exploration.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not saying that you&#8217;ll have perfect prose at the end of the month&#8212;you may have only the vaguest kernel of a story or the basics for plot or character&#8212;but it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll produce some text you can use or you&#8217;ll have learned a new way to write freely without censoring every word choice.</p>
<p>And you may actually start a story that will ultimately be published&#8212;dozens of novels begun in NaNo have been published traditionally, while others have been self-published.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether or not you try NaNo this year, do consider trying something new in the next weeks or months&#8212;a different style, a different approach, a different type of protagonist. Push yourself to explore the craft in a way you&#8217;ve never done.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you always write a detailed outline, try beginning a new story with only the briefest of outlines. If you never outline, take the next few weeks and outline a new story so that you&#8217;re ready to begin at midnight on November first.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not ready to write, not ready to begin a new project, or don&#8217;t have the time to do so in November, commit to something else.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Read a new grammar book</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Work through <em>all</em> the exercises in a writing book</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Join a writing group and learn to critique</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Spend the month going in-depth with one or two of the fiction elements, preferably elements you either have trouble with or know nothing about&#8212;subtext? theme? mood?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Force yourself out of your comfort zone and make yourself uncomfortable with some writing element (saturate yourself with grammar rules) until you become proficient with it</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Read at least five to ten novels in a genre you don&#8217;t normally read or have never read</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Take an online writing course <em>and participate in the discussion groups and forums</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Find a critique partner</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Submit a finished manuscript to at least five agents or publishers</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you&#8217;re one who&#8217;s always online visiting writing groups and forums instead of actually writing, cut your Internet time and write instead&#8212;yes, I know this may be the most difficult suggestion of the group</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you&#8217;re one who never visits online writing sites and forums and have no idea what&#8217;s going on in the wider writing community, find a few sites and engage with writers already there</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Write some poetry</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Write a three-page synopsis or two for each of your completed manuscripts</p>
<p>I could go on and on with suggestions, but you get the picture&#8212;do something different and challenging. If your stories need an infusion, give them one by breaking out of whatever is commonplace and normal for you and try something else. <strong>Give yourself permission to try something radically different from your normal practices</strong>. Write at a different time of day. Go without lunch every day and give that time over to writing. Just try something different. Shake up normal and see what develops from doing so.</p>
<p>When you make a discovery, positive or negative, push beyond that single discovery and see what else you can discover. Don&#8217;t be satisfied with one revelation&#8212;search for more.</p>
<p>If you can try NaNo, do. If you succeed even partially, you&#8217;ll feel the success and it will spur you to try more.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s plenty of support for those who commit to NaNo</strong>. The NaNo website has forums where you can find encouragement as well as writing tips. There are groups online you can join, or you can physically meet up with groups in many countries around the world.</p>
<p>You can join groups where NaNo &#8220;teams&#8221; challenge other teams to word counts. Some groups even meet for writing sessions&#8212;they get together at cafes or libraries and have write-ins.</p>
<p>You can do this&#8212;I promise that you can. You may need help from a spouse or others in terms of logistics, but this is only one month out of a lifetime of months, a few hours a day&#8212;go for it. Push yourself to try something new. <strong>Push yourself beyond your long-held expectations</strong>.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t succeed, don&#8217;t write 50,000 words in one month, so what? There&#8217;s no shame in not meeting the goal. It&#8217;s a benchmark, not a do-or-die finish line. Try it. See what you can do. See what you can learn about writing, about yourself, about your stories and your style.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Press deep and stop settling for surface successes</strong>. There&#8217;s more inside you than surface-level discoveries. There are deeper emotions and more evocative phrases. There&#8217;s depth and strength and power. There is light and darkness. There are twists and calm seas and surprises. There are stories and characters and worlds that no one else can write.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are adventures and insights in your soul that no one else can uncover, that no one else has ever touched or seen or heard. There is power to create churning inside you, power that needs an outlet, that needs life, and only you can give life to that power, to the power that moves readers and opens their eyes to truths that only your heart understands. We&#8212;all the readers of the world&#8212;we need your gifts and your daring. We need you to be fearless. We need you to let out the stories that are roaring inside your soul.</p>
<p>Give the world your best&#8212;what good is only a percentage of your talent or your effort? What good is good enough when readers want passion and majesty and despair and victory over overwhelming odds? What good is so-so? What reader wants to spend time in a so-so world with so-so characters whose dilemmas don&#8217;t move that reader? That don&#8217;t offer hope? That don&#8217;t challenge? That don&#8217;t even entertain?</p>
<p><strong>No reader wants a writer to hold back</strong>. <em>No reader wants you to hold back</em>. Readers want the full gamut of emotions and adventures that beset characters. They want the richness of every emotion expressed to the nth degree. They want to cry and laugh and rage and fear. They want to feel.</p>
<p>Give readers what they want. Give them what they come to fiction for. Write with power and passion. <strong>Push beyond the safe and explore what the deep places have to say</strong>.</p>
<p>Push yourself. Rise above the ordinary and press into the deep places. Give all and not only part. Write us something astonishing.</p>
<p>Write the story of your heart.</p>
