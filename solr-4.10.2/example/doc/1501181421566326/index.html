				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/to-do-the-deal-review-a-slick-polished-read/"><img width="267" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/22774618-267x400.jpg" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="22774618" /></a><p><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/22774618.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-10880 aligncenter" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/22774618-200x300.jpg" alt="22774618" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>This agreeable work of fiction has an unusual structure: the subtitle describes it as “A Novel in Stories”, and the book comprises ten stand-alone short stories, one set in each year from 1991 to 2000, each one following the same family, from newlyweds to parenthood. One story, “Christmas and the Car Salesman”, had previously been published separately in a magazine.</p>
<p>However, reading them all together they strike you as simply a precisely structured novel following the progress of a young, ambitious but not especially gifted salesman, Kenneth Bodine. Bodine serves as a kind of Everyman figure for small-town American white-collar workers, unremarkable in many ways but with integrity, decency, and an instinct to provide for his wife and children, though a lurking sense of Thoreau-style quiet desperation never far away. We see Bodine steer his way through job opportunities and disappointments, and disruptions from colleagues, employers, family members, friends and neighbours. Throughout he remains broadly optimistic and virtuous, despite numerous temptations and distractions.</p>
<p>The polished narrative is subtle, gentle, unsentimental and understated. It’s easy to relate to the characters and their dilemmas. The story is enriched by implied back-stories hinted at by small details dropped in along the way, e.g. Bodine’s daughters’ obsession with dolls’ house bathroom furniture, wittily echoing their parents’ home improvement plans that threaten to undermine their precarious financial position. I particularly liked the “puzzle soup” incident, in which the little girls liven up a dull playdate at a neighbouring child’s house by mixing up the pieces from all her jigsaw puzzles, to the chagrin of their mother.</p>
<p>There is also effective characterisation for the minor players such as Bodine’s estranged parents, his series of dodgy bosses, and colleagues with lesser ethics than his own. The odd item of dress or make-up can speak volumes about a character. There’s just enough description and believable dialogue to create a real and believable atmosphere, but there’s also a sense of distance between the action and the reader, as if inviting the reader to judge, and an undercurrent of affectionate playfulness.</p>
<p>Baker’s wry yet courteous way with words, reminiscent of Garrison Keillor, often made me smile, e.g. “Kenneth had gained from his youth a certain familiarity with the penal code”; “It was work that anyone who was not stoned could do”, and, describing one of his employers, “He had the girth of a man who is done with stairs”.</p>
<p>The novel ends in 2000, with the Bodine family narrowly averting both a personal finance crisis and also a marital one. Despite knowing from the outset that the book would end in the tenth story and year, the conclusion still felt a little abrupt to me – or maybe it was just that I was reluctant to part company from this unassuming and likeable family who represent so many millions of people across the USA. (The book reminded me of David Byrne’s masterful movie about small-town America, <em>True Stories</em>, which I very much admire.) There was also an element of mischief about ending the book at this historic moment, as we moved into the current millennium with the dubious joys that it was to bring, not least the economic downturn that will have felled so many Bodines at the knees.</p>
<p>This book would be enjoyed by anyone who has a fondness for small-town America, or who has ever been through a similar career path to Bodine, or who has shared his same ideals and found the going tough. It’s also great entertainment for those who like subtle writing of understated cleverness. I, for one, was left yearning for an update on Bodine’s next decade.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/autobiographical-fiction-i-was-there-when-none-of-this-happened/"><img width="700" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mary-Maddox-700x400.jpg" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="Mary Maddox" /></a><p>Fiction writers often begin with autobiography, especially young writers. Life is painful and incomprehensible. Their stories cry out and struggle to comprehend the world. My early fiction was cathartic in this way. But I soon figured out that personal experience is limiting. The characters in autobiographical stories are distorted fragments of the people on whom they&#8217;re based, and what happened is often less significant than what might have happened.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a sea of darkness beyond the uncertain light of memory. The truth is somewhere out there, and once my imagination enters the darkness, I abandon any pretence of autobiography. I&#8217;m not writing about actual people or events anymore. I&#8217;m writing about ghosts and dreams. The story can become anything.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d reached that point when I wrote &#8220;Mandarian Training School.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although rooted in experience, the story is fiction. Most of the events never happened, and the characters only loosely resemble people I met at a summer school for high-school students with mathematical ability at San Diego State University. The distinction matters. The story reflects my imagination, not any kind of objective reality.</p>
<p>At fifteen I was a year younger than most of the participants. People who know me now might be surprised that I applied and even more surprised that I qualified. My friends at Charleston Scrabble Club will tell you that I&#8217;m not exactly a whiz at keeping score. My interest in math is mild at best, and I&#8217;ve forgotten most of what I learned. These days I can barely solve a binary equation.</p>
<p>Mathematics is an elegant and challenging language. It expresses concepts that cannot be understood in any other way. As a child I loved math. The summer in San Diego changed that. Emotionally I was unprepared for the workload or the competition. I worked my butt off and felt like the stupidest person in the program. But when I received our class rankings some months later, my name appeared in the middle of the list. I wasn&#8217;t a failure. Only mediocre. Somehow that seemed just as bad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mandarian Training School&#8221; chronicles my emotional struggle during that summer long ago. And yes, writing it was cathartic. In retrospect, it marked a milestone for me as a writer, the point where I broke away from personal experience and learned to see in the dark.</p>

<p>Mary Maddox is a horror and dark fantasy novelist with what <em>The Charleston Times-Courier</em> calls a “Ray Bradbury-like gift for deft, deep-shadowed description.” Born in Soldiers Summit, high in the mountains of Utah, Maddox graduated with honors in creative writing from Knox College, and went on to earn an MFA from the University of Iowa Writers&#8217; Workshop. She taught writing at Eastern Illinois University and has published stories in various journals, including <em>Yellow Silk,</em> <em>Farmer&#8217;s Market,</em> <em>The Scream Online, </em>and <em>The Huffington Post.</em> The Illinois Arts Council has honored her fiction with a Literary Award and an Artist&#8217;s Grant.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Big 6 are not so big any more &#8211; they’ve shrunk to the Big 5. And that’s not all. According to the latest available figures, Penguin Random House came top of the table with a 24% share of the market, but its sales were down £342m (15%). All the others &#8211; Hachette, HarperCollins, Pan MacMillan, Bloomsbury, and Simon &amp; Schuster were also down. Their total share of the market was only 59% &#8211; down from 70% in 2001. Is this a sign that their dominance of the book trade is fading? I think it is. But they won&#8217;t go down without a fight, so &#8211; more turbulent times ahead.</p>
<p><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/killerpenguin.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-10871 aligncenter" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/killerpenguin.png" alt="killerpenguin" width="200" height="207" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The end of Constable and Quercus</strong></p>
<p>The hope of many &#8216;mid list&#8217; and &#8216;literary&#8217; authors dumped by the Big 5 for commercial reasons has been a group of valiant and well-respected independently owned publishers still willing to take on authors for their literary merit. These presses have been having a hard time of it in the orca-infested ocean that is BookWorld at the moment. The trend for conglomeration in the face of severe competition continues and this inevitably means mergers and job losses. The Penguin Random House merger has seen major bloodshed among the staff (out of the public eye) with the loss of many talented individuals, some of whom have now gone freelance because there&#8217;s simply nowhere else to go. Several small independent publishers have been hoovered up &#8211; sadly the innovative Quercus press was acquired by Hodder (part of Hachette) after making big losses.</p>
<div id="attachment_10869" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Hachette.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-10869" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Hachette-300x131.png" alt="Swallowed by Hatchette" width="300" height="131" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Swallowed by Hachette</p></div>
<p>Constable, which was taken over by Nick Robinson is 2000, has now been taken over by Little, Brown (also part of Hachette) following Nick&#8217;s recent death. This means less choice for traditionally published authors and will precipitate more movement towards the self-publishing sector.</p>
<p>Hachette are now the second biggest publishing conglomerate</p>
<p><strong>Self-publishing and Ebooks on the rise</strong></p>
<p>What the 2013 figures do show is that self-publishing in both ebook and paper book formats is really taking off. Paperback sales through Lulu rose 38% and CreateSpace sales were up a massive 161%.   This is bound to send shivers of fear through the boardrooms of the publishing industry. Half of all book sales (both traditional and self-published) in the UK are now through Amazon.</p>
<p>Rumours that ebook sales are flat-lining are untrue. Obviously they aren&#8217;t soaring at the goldrush rates that happened in the beginning, but they&#8217;re now climbing at more realistic levels. According to Nielsen, ebook sales across the industry were up 20% overall in 2013 and readers spent more than £300m buying at least 80m ebooks. This accounted for more than a quarter of all book purchases. One in five of these sales (12% of all sales) was an &#8216;Indie&#8217; book. Early figures from the first three months of 2014 show that the moment when ebook sales will overtake paper book sales is very close and the percentage of &#8216;Indie&#8217; books is also rising fast, particularly in the USA. In the UK Tesco have just launched their own ebook platform Blinkbox Books with a reading tablet called the Hudl (who thought that one up?). It&#8217;s too early to tell where this will go, or whether this is a significant opportunity for Indies, though they&#8217;ve apparently sold 500,000 Hudls so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tesco-Hudl.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-10874 aligncenter" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tesco-Hudl-300x200.jpg" alt="Tesco-Hudl" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Paperback sales down</strong></p>
<p>The figures for paperback sales were rather more depressing for traditional publishers and booksellers &#8211; sales have fallen by 23% and now account for only 66% of the market. There&#8217;s a lot of pressure within the industry to be more digitally aware &#8211; the publishing and retailing sectors of the book market were initially slow to realise the potential and have been very resistant to e-publishing. Many are still hostile and unable to accept the fact that e-publishing is here to stay. They seem to think that if they throw their weight about a bit they can put it back in the box. They feel the same about self-publishing. It&#8217;s obvious to observers that the two sectors are going to have to co-exist. The Hachette/Amazon dispute is only one of many conflicts as the traditional world of publishing is confronted by a changing landscape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ebook Fiction up from £4m to £200m</strong></p>
<p>The Bookseller also released some interesting publisher statistics that give a bit more information about what is really happening within the genre divisions. In 2013 paper book sales of fiction were down from £561m to £400m, but ebook sales of fiction are up from only £4m to a whopping £200m in the same period. Non-fiction suffered less, with only a minor shift from paper to ebook, but children&#8217;s paper book sales dropped £35m without any compensation in digital sales &#8211; bad news for children&#8217;s authors. But many children are reading on i-pads &#8211; particularly i-pad minis. My 4 year old grand-daughter reads a lot on her i-pad mini and loves interactive books. Her mother (a publishing professional with one of the Big 5) reads on the i-pad when it&#8217;s not otherwise engaged. Authors need to think about Apple much more seriously as a market for books. It may well become bigger than Kindle.</p>
<p><strong>What does it all mean?</strong></p>
<p>The future for ebooks is bright. This doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;ll replace paperbooks entirely, but there will be more of an even balance between E and paper sales. It also means that there will be more opportunities for Indies, but we&#8217;re going to have to be more pro-active in marketing ourselves against increasing opposition from the traditional publishing sector. The problem of visibility also increases as there are more and more authors clamouring to sell themselves in the self-published arena. We&#8217;re probably going to be forced to buy in marketing as well as editorial services if we want to be seen, but there are lots of refugees from the Big 5 offering their experience freelance.</p>
<p>The rosy dawn of self-publishing is over &#8211; it&#8217;s now a serious business and we are in competition with traditional industry professionals who won&#8217;t necessarily play fair. They see themselves as the legitimate land-owners and ourselves as the barbarian hordes. Naturally, they want to protect their commercial interests from the self-published invaders. We will have to think about how we organise ourselves to cope with a probable book war in the near future. The Hachette/Amazon conflict, recently settled, is only the beginning. But history is on our side &#8211; the mighty Roman Empire fell to the Barbarians eventually!</p>

<p><strong>Think about this:</strong></p>
<p>The general perception is that as soon as money comes into play between a reviewer and an author that review is tainted, no longer trustworthy. The assumption is that it would be difficult for the reviewer not to give a good review. Wouldn’t you be nicer in that situation? Probably, and we all know that some people pay for five star reviews or swop them with friends. But you aren’t a professional reviewer.</p>
<p><strong>But what if?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As with the Awesome Indies, the reviewer has no personal contact with the author at all. The contact is done via an intermediary.</li>
<li>The review policy states quite clearly that an honest review will be given and all-star ratings posted regardless of payment.</li>
<li>The name of the reviewer isn’t published, so they have no fear of backlash.</li>
<li>The author does not pay the reviewer. Their money goes into a fund out of which the reviewers are paid by the organisation.</li>
<li>The reviewer is a professional, not just meaning that they get paid for it, but that they adhere to a code of ethics.</li>
<li><strong>Why, in this situation, would they not write an honest review? </strong>I see absolutely no reason for any bias when it is handled this way.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Code of ethics? </strong></p>
<p>Is there one? Of course. Do you think the reviews in your big newspapers are written by people who write nice reviews just because they get paid? No, they write honest reviews because that is what a professional reviewer does.</p>
<p><strong>Think about this:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before the proliferation of book blogs, all published reviewers were written by reviewers who were paid for it. The reviews that still carry the most weight when quoted on a book cover come from reviewers who are paid, like The New York Times, The Sydney Morning Herald and so on.</li>
<li>But very few authors get their books read and reviewed by a big newspaper reviewer. How do some books get read and others don’t? Do you really think there isn’t money involved between publishers and newspapers to get their book on the review list? Publishers pay book stores for their books to be given prominent places; that’s how it’s always worked.</li>
<li>If you were an author and could pay to get a review on The New York Times, I bet you’d be happy to do so, just to make sure it happened. And you wouldn’t expect them to write a nice review, would you?</li>
<li>And yet, you think there is something wrong with paying a professional reviewer with the same qualifications as those employed by newspapers and magazines, just because they publish on a blog, now a newspaper. Duh! We aren’t talking about your general blogger here, we’re talking about qualified professionals in all sense of the word.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Now consider this:</strong></p>
<p>The Awesome Indies is a volunteer organisation.</p>
<p><strong>And:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We require reviewers with formal qualifications (take a look at their Reviewers’ list).</li>
<li>Most qualified reviewers want to be paid.</li>
<li>We have a free submission option, so we cannot pay our reviewers.</li>
<li>Therefore, we don’t have many reviewers;</li>
<li>Therefore, it takes a hell of a lot of time to get your review.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Think about: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How long it takes to:
<ul>
<li>read a book,</li>
<li>analyse it and</li>
<li>write a review.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How many books they would like to put down, but read anyway, just because you expect a review. Poor quality books—and we get them—take the joy out of reading.</li>
<li>How long they studied to gain the qualifications we require of our reviewers.</li>
<li>How far a $20 or $30 fee goes towards compensating a reviewer for their time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do you really begrudge them a little payment? </strong></p>
<p>For so long as you insist that a reviewer who is paid is somehow less honest than one that is not, you will find it very hard to get reviews from the people you most need them from—those who know what they’re talking about.</p>
<p>Are you scared that you’ll pay and get a poor review? That’s a good reason not to pay, but don’t use accusing professional reviewers of unethical behaviour just to cover your real fears. If they were unethical, you wouldn’t have to worry, would you?</p>
<p>Are you simply too poor to pay? Fine, I am too. I won’t pay for a review, because I can’t afford to, but the Awesome Indies has a free system for people like me—proof we’re not out to make money.</p>
<p>We’re squashed between the proverbial rock and hard place. If more authors paid an administration fee, we would have more money in our reviewers’ fund, we could then afford to pay them and we would have more of them. As it is, be prepared for your submission to take a very long time—six months or more in some cases.</p>
<p><em>For your information, we presently have many reviewers who refuse to receive any payment for their reviews even when we offer it, our difficulty is in attracting more reviewers to work for us. </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/when-anyone-with-a-computer-can-publish-themselves-what-determines-the-value-of-a-writer/"><img width="890" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/All-my-books2-890x400.jpg" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="All my books2" /></a><h1></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can dash off a story, whip up a cover, upload a file, press a button labelled Publish and have your book appear on a book-selling website instantly. Okay, so it isn’t quite that simple—you do have to be able to make your word document clean enough for ebook-making software to turn it into something readable on an ereader—but you don’t have to pay an editor. You don’t even have to edit it! And you can throw the cover together yourself in a word document! Sure, the result is likely to be crappy—very crappy—but the point is that you can do that little and still have a published book to your name.</p>
<p>Then readers can find it—if they’re unlucky or you’ve spent a bit of money in advertisements or have a lot of friends and make it cheap or free—and they can even read it and like it and give it 5 star reviews. Argh! Why? Because, as with all art forms, most people don’t know much about technique and matters of craftsmanship, but they do know what they like. They can read a badly written story and not notice it’s badly written because the story is actually quite entertaining. The fact that it can, and should be, better written isn’t a concern for some people. For the reader, they either like it or not, like it a little or like it a lot. Nothing wrong with that. Readers shouldn’t have to be experts, because books shouldn’t be published unless they meet certain standards. Unfortunately, that isn’t the case today. And even poor quality can sell well.</p>
<p>The old system of publishers as gatekeepers was not fair and kept a lot of good books from readers, but the new free for all publishing is not fair either because readers can’t see the good books for all the bad ones. I’m not going to suggest a new gatekeeping system, because too many people will protest and nothing will be perfect. My solution is a vetting system like the Awesome Indies. Let them publish, but make sure that the good ones are identified and promoted. For that to happen in any meaningful way, Amazon needs to have a commitment to promoting quality as defined by independent qualified reviewers, not from reader reviews.</p>
<p><em>So, you’ve published a book. That’s nice. How do I know you’re any good? </em></p>
<p>You don’t.</p>
<p><em>Oh, it says here your book is a best seller. Awesome; it must be good.</em></p>
<p>Yeah; it was in the top 100 in the cosy women’s mystery category on Amazon for one hour.</p>
<p><em>Wow. How many books have you sold? 100,000? A million?</em></p>
<p>Umm, around 500.</p>
<p><em>Oh, that doesn’t sound very good. </em></p>
<p>The book is well written. It’s great story, honestly. It’s had excellent reviews from top literary critics.</p>
<p><em>Like the New York Times?</em></p>
<p>Er, no, just respected book bloggers.</p>
<p><em>That’s nice. What’s your real job?</em></p>
<p>Positive critical appraisal, big book sales or both? What determines the value of a writer? We would all like both, obviously, but if asked to choose one indicator of value, I’d go for positive critical appraisal by people who know what they’re talking about, whether they work for the NY Times or just run their own book blog. That determines real value, but selling books has value too. That worldly kind of success puts food on the table; it allows you to give up your day job and become a full time writer, and it is the measure of success in most people’s eyes. Trouble is, you can still sell lots of bad books. That’s why I go for critical appraisal as the true measure. Sales determine your value as a sales person, not necessarily as an author.</p>
<p>How do you determine the value of an author?</p>
<p>These are the kinds of questions raised in my latest book <a href="http://geni.us/1xyc"><em>Prunella Smith: Worlds Within Worlds</em></a> a metaphysical thriller.</p>
<p>Amy Spahn, literary critic says:</p>
<p>“This book will make you think. Considering the deluge of new works streaming from authors these days, that may be the highest praise a novel can receive.”</p>
<p>Worlds Within Worlds has a unique perspective on the nature of creativity. Its touch is light, its humour distinctive but it reaches deep into the nature of human experience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/four-books-in-one-metaphysical-layer-cake-with-chocolate-buttons-and-bitter-lemons/"><img width="890" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB-890x400.jpg" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="Worlds_Final-WEB" /></a><p><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-10620" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB-198x300.jpg" alt="Worlds_Final-WEB" width="198" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Wow- Four main themes, plus what could be a heap of short stories in one of the most innovative and original works I have read in a long time. I couldn&#8217;t possible pin point this work to a genre, as the metaphysical, the fantasy, the thriller, the speculative, and the literary combine and melt into each other.<br />
This is written on four levels of consciousness- the self disguised, the self as another, the self as omnipresent, and the self in a parallel existence.<br />
If that sounds heavy- it isn&#8217;t. Really well written books are open to most readers, not just to genre, academic and literary world toffs. This is a brilliant general readers book. I have almost never read a novel in one sitting, I am a very slow and precise line reader, but I came very close to doing so this time. Newland&#8217;s vision, writing in the first person as the writer Prunella Smith, worked for me on so many different levels. I forget most books within days, sometimes less. I won&#8217;t forget this one.<br />
Sometimes a clever work like this can help readers escape the myopia of the favoured genre, and in doing so do many favours. Now, obviously one may argue that such books then fall into the trap of never really grabbing anyone. There is no answer to that, but there is no harm in trying something different. Think fusion in cuisine, mixed medium art galleries, market stall shopping, multi-themed gardens, and you will be on the a suitably flexible wave to get stuck into this book.<br />
Once you get going you will get to the end only too soon. Yes, this is compulsive enough to collapse time, but actually it isn&#8217;t a long book anyway. So don&#8217;t do that skim-reading thing, but rather make sure you taste all the words as you float through. Listen to the contemplative Buddhist inside you, so as to suppress your own bit of Dita. No, nothing is required to enjoy this, nothing -ist needed at all. As for Dita- read to find out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/get-on-board-little-children-review-a-damn-fine-story-that-is-extremely-well-told/"><img width="890" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Get-on-Board-Little-Children-890x400.jpg" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="Get on Board Little Children" /></a><p><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Get-on-Board-Little-Children.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-10807" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Get-on-Board-Little-Children-200x300.jpg" alt="Get on Board Little Children" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>When greedy, unscrupulous politicians with ideological agendas and little compassion for their fellow man start to sneak laws into our system to advance that agenda – we’d better beware. Citizens who pay no attention to what politicians do can easily wake up and find themselves under the yoke of a police state and creeping totalitarianism.</p>
<p>In <em>Get on Board Little Children</em> by Victoria Randall, we’re immersed head first in just such a state. The United States has enacted strict population control measures and left it to the states to implement them. Each state has its own views, and some, like the state of Washington, have adopted draconian procedures, up to and including a Bureau of Population Management. In order to legally have children, people must obtain a permit – an expensive and time consuming process – or risk fines and imprisonment, forced abortion, or if the child is born without permit, having it consigned to a labor camp. In order to enforce this, a police state of sorts has been created, complete with officious bureaucrats and scheming politicians drunk on the power they possess.</p>
<p>Sophie Cortez and her husband Joshua find themselves caught up in this byzantine situation when she becomes pregnant with twins. When Sophie and Joshua make the decision to run, they’re taken under the wings of BirthAid, an organization that runs a 21<sup>st</sup> century version of the Underground Railroad that takes immense risks to get them to safety.</p>
<p>Randall has created a compelling cast of characters – many that readers will recognize and identify with, or hate. The beleaguered citizen fighting to maintain a sense of dignity and self-worth: Sophie and Joshua; the uncaring bureaucrat concerned with exercising power and maintaining position: the Bureau of Population Management officials; and those who, when they see someone in need, are willing to step up and be counted.</p>
<p>It’s hard to decide if this is science fiction or thriller, so I just settled with calling it a damn fine story that is extremely well-told. It starts slow, with rising tension that comes to a gentle landing that is satisfying.</p>
<p>This is a book that, like <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>, addresses an important social issue – in this case, individual freedom in the face of efforts at state control – and could like Stowe’s masterpiece become the symbol of this century’s most important struggle.</p>
