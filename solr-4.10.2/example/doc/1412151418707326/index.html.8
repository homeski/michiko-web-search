Or music artists, politicians, magicians, authors, dancers, mega-church pastors. Pick your favorite celebrity flavor.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s often difficult to get famous people to grant you an interview. I spent 12 years pursuing CEOs of major corporations for interviews as a staff reporter, and I was a movie-industry secretary for several years, so I speak from experience on both sides of the fence here.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I learned: To get household names to slot you an interview time, you have to be wily, creative, and unstoppable.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>Here are my tips for landing celebrity interviews:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-4042"></span></p>
<h2>1. Start small</h2>
<p>Major celebrities want to be interviewed by people with a track record of interviewing public figures. So if you&#8217;re interested in this niche, look for ways to get started.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to interview Lady Gaga, start interviewing local singers in your town for the local daily or alternative paper. Into politics? Talk to your small-town mayor, or cover your city council for a local rag. If you swoon over actors, interview the star of your local theater production for a start.</p>
<p>Every town has local celebrities &#8212; the former Olympian or TV star from the &#8217;60s who retired there. Find them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s common these days for big celebrities to do group phone interviews, where hundreds of reporters might be on the line, taking turns asking questions. Don&#8217;t turn these offers down &#8212; go, listen, learn what the big outlets ask, and see if you can get in a question. Sure, it&#8217;s not an exclusive, but it&#8217;s a start at interacting with celebs.</p>
<p>Build up your celebrity-interview track record, so you can show clips that confirm you&#8217;re accurate and know how to get lively quotes from busy people.</p>
<h2>2. Work your connections</h2>
<p>Never assume you know no one who could give you an introduction to a celebrity. The way we&#8217;re all connected online these days, it&#8217;s six degrees of Kevin Bacon out there.</p>
<p>Remember, you may not need a connection directly to the celeb. An introduction to one of their handlers &#8212; manager, agent, publicist &#8212; might work just as well. Start by asking if anyone knows who manages your dreamboat (or Google it and see if you can find out). Getting a warm intro to one of the team could be all you need to get your interview idea a fair hearing.</p>
<h2>3. Appeal to their interests</h2>
<p>Do some research and learn about your celebrity. Do they have a pet charity they love to support? Did they found a charity of their own? Are they a born-again Christian? A Scientologist? A vegan? A motorcycle nut?</p>
<p>Think about publications that might want an interview with your target about that aspect of their life. Celebrities give many interviews, and they like variety. They get tired of being asked the same six questions about their upcoming film, and might love to talk about their new boyfriend, their customized Harley, their backyard organic garden&#8230;anything else.</p>
<p>Develop a focused angle for your interview that&#8217;s off the beaten trail and interest a magazine in it, and you might get a yes. A pitch like &#8220;I want to interview Joe Famous for X magazine&#8221; leaves the celebrity nervous about what you might ask.</p>
<h2>4. Be where they are</h2>
<p>One thing is as certain as the rising of the sun: Celebrities make personal appearances. They turn up at movie premieres and charity events and industry conclaves on a fairly regular basis.</p>
<p>Greta Garbo and J.D. Salinger are dead, and so is the concept of the reclusive celebrity. They all appear sooner or later, and they all want press.</p>
<p>Your job is to learn where they&#8217;ll be, and show up there. Yes, you might need to wangle a ticket to an event, or even buy one. But usually, there&#8217;ll be a media question time at these celebrity sightings, and you could get a chance to pop out a question or two.</p>
<h2>5. Persist</h2>
<p>Top celebrities often have multiple layers of protection around them, and it&#8217;s all designed to get rid of you. A hot actor may have both a manager and an agent, as well as a publicist and a personal assistant. You watched <em>Entourage</em>, right?</p>
<p>All of these people may need to confer and concur that your interview proposal is a good idea. That can take weeks.</p>
<p>Allow plenty of time. Often, you&#8217;ll have to gently follow up, over and over. Never, ever be angry with the team. That will kill your chances dead.</p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t hearing a yes, don&#8217;t just sit on your hands waiting. Keep developing thoughts and ideas and questions&#8230;and send them over. Try a junior member of the PR staff and see if you can pick their brain for tips. Propose different angles. See what might make the penny drop.</p>
<p>With some celebs, this may be a dance that takes years to complete. Just keep working at it and developing relationships with celebrity PR people.</p>
<h2>6. Use social media</h2>
<p>Social media has become the great workaround for reaching celebrities with an impenetrable PR wall. Many celebrities are tweeting their little hearts out. You can stalk venture capitalists on LinkedIn &#8212; I did that more than once for one of my <a title="How They Started" href="http://www.amazon.com/How-They-Started-David-Lester-ebook/dp/B008846LN0/" target="_blank">print business books</a>. I also got one of the biggest interviews in that book by leaving a comment on one very famous company founder&#8217;s blog.</p>
<p>If you think a prominent figure won&#8217;t return your tweet, I&#8217;ll just say that I got <a title="Entrepreneur -- Shark Tank effect" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/slideshow/224405" target="_blank">every investor on the ABC series <em>Shark Tank</em></a> to talk to me for one feature article &#8212; and I connected with most of them on<img class="alignright wp-image-4153 " src="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/Herjevec-answers-my-tweet.png" alt="Herjevec from Shark Tank answers my tweet" width="434" height="227" /> Twitter.</p>
<p>One thing I&#8217;ll note about that tweet on the right: My pitch there also uses tip #3.</p>
<p>What investor doesn&#8217;t want to brag about how smart they are, and how their picks did great? So I didn&#8217;t just tweet them &#8212; I had a question I knew they&#8217;d love to answer.</p>
<h2>7. Dig dirt</h2>
<p>There is one foolproof way to get a celebrity to talk &#8212; find out something scandalous about them that nobody else knows yet.</p>
<p>Comb court records for lawsuits. Interview their former housekeeper. Verify nasty rumors you hear.</p>
<p>This approach won&#8217;t be for everybody, but it&#8217;s the tabloids&#8217; bread-and-butter. Everybody loves an exposé. Even better, if you find your own facts, then you&#8217;ve got a story about a celebrity you can do, even if they <em>refuse</em> to talk. But most often, they&#8217;ll jump at the chance to spin the negative news their way.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s less common, you can also break stories and get celebs on the line by finding out something good that&#8217;s not common knowledge yet, too. That baby on the way, the hot new role they&#8217;ve landed &#8212; that works, too.</p>
<h2>Which comes first</h2>
<p>One of the big questions I get asked about celebrity interviews is who to ask first &#8212; the publication or the celebrity. The answer is the celebrity.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t ever want to tell a magazine you can deliver a celebrity interview, only to have to come back later and say really, you had no contact with that person and they&#8217;re not returning your calls. That can really blow your credibility with that editor.</p>
<p>What you can do is explore with a magazine editor whether they&#8217;d be interested in an interview with Jill Rockstar about X topic. You&#8217;ll almost always get a &#8216;yes&#8217; &#8212; and then you can take that to the celebrity&#8217;s people to show them their star won&#8217;t be wasting their time talking to you.</p>
<p>I once cold-called a celebrity magazine to ask if they were interested in a chat with a film star I knew I would be on-set with soon&#8230;and they about fell over themselves with excitement. They didn&#8217;t even ask to see my clips (which were nonexistent at that point).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got access to a celebrity, it can open a lot of doors. It&#8217;s worth starting small and building up some celeb Q&amp;A clips to show around.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4146" src="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/photodune-5630330-blogging-concept-xs-300x199.jpg" alt="Blogging concept" width="300" height="199" />You may think this is a funny piece of advice for me to write on my blog.</p>
<p>But if you care about earning more as a freelance writer, then you might want to stop writing blog posts.</p>
<p>Why do I say this?</p>
<p>There are four big reasons I want to steer you away from blogging:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-4133"></span></p>
<h2>1. It&#8217;s a time-waster</h2>
<p>One common affliction currently plaguing many aspiring freelance writers is that they start a blog because they&#8217;ve heard they should. Next, they fall in love with the blog, and then spend way too much time on it. All at the expense of finding the paying clients they need, and without examining what they&#8217;re blogging about or why.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the typical diary-you-put-online type blog posts rarely attract many readers. And they don&#8217;t make a good writing sample for luring clients, either. Businesses want fact-filled posts written on a single topic, not random posts about your personal thoughts.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s so empowering, pushing that &#8216;publish&#8217; button on whatever you want to say&#8230;that it becomes addictive.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unusual for writers to tell me:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My goals for this month include posting twice a week on each of my three personal blogs. Plus&#8230;um&#8230;guess I need to do some marketing to find clients.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The blogging sucks up all your free time, the marketing falls to the bottom of your priority list, and next year, you&#8217;re still starving.</p>
<h2>2. It has a crummy reputation</h2>
<p>No client is impressed to hear that you&#8217;re writing blog posts.</p>
<p>Blogging is the entry point. The bottom rung. There&#8217;s no barrier to entry. Often, you have no editor &#8212; and your prospects know it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why blogging isn&#8217;t a prestigious type of writing.</p>
<p>If you can manage to guest post on a big, popular, brand-name blog, that helps your cred a bit. But it&#8217;s still not a byline in <em>Vanity Fair</em> or the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>
<h2>3. It doesn&#8217;t pay well</h2>
<p>Yes, there is an elite rank of business blogging clients that now pay $100-$300 a blog post and more. But even this upper end of blog-post pay is low compared to what you can earn from other types of writing.</p>
<p>And the vast majority of blogging gigs are still going for $5-$25 a post, which isn&#8217;t a living wage in any First World country, no matter how fast you write.</p>
<h2>4. It&#8217;s a shrinking market</h2>
<p>With the ongoing efforts of Google to exclude mass-content sites from its search results, the forecast is for less blogging-for-hire work in future. Most of the cheap, SEO-keyword driven, short-post assignments are drying up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a dying niche because semi-literate, half-baked posts you dash off in 15 minutes for search robots to index don&#8217;t work any more. They don&#8217;t drive traffic because they&#8217;re not turning up in search results. So businesses are not going to pay even $5 for them in future.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re dependent on this sort of work for your living right now, it&#8217;s time to make plans to move into a new niche. You&#8217;ve got all your eggs in a vanishing basket.</p>
<h2>What to write instead</h2>
<p>If I&#8217;ve made you rethink your feelings about blogging, good.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to tell you to stop writing, of course. Just that blogging isn&#8217;t the greatest format if you&#8217;re looking to earn a living from writing (short of seeing a moonshot success on monetizing your own blog).</p>
<p>So what should you write instead of blog posts? Articles.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Articles pay well.</strong> You can earn $1 a word and more, from better companies and publications.</li>
<li><strong>Articles are a prestige assignment.</strong> You&#8217;re not &#8216;just a blogger&#8217; anymore.</li>
<li><strong>Article clips are respected.</strong> Editors and marketing managers alike are impressed when you show them article clips.</li>
<li><strong>People love to read articles.</strong> This is a format that&#8217;s been around a long time, and readers &#8216;get&#8217; it.</li>
<li><strong>Blog posts are becoming articles.</strong> The call for 2,000-word blog posts on many top blogs and websites really means they want articles.</li>
<li><strong>Businesses need articles.</strong> Increasingly, corporate clients are looking for article content for their websites, to set them apart from all those ordinary, low-value blog posts. I&#8217;ve earned $2 a word in this niche.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The secret of online writing success</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you in on a little secret that I think was key to this blog&#8217;s success: I never thought of myself as a blogger.</p>
<p>My concept for this blog has always been that I&#8217;m writing and publishing an online magazine, and these posts are the articles. And that has made all the difference.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why while most blogs blather on about the author&#8217;s personal feelings or whatever strikes their fancy that morning, I do <a title="Writing for Guardian Liberty Voice" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/writing-for-guardian-liberty-voice/" target="_blank">exposés</a>, report on <a title="What the Elance-Odesk merger means for freelancers" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/elance-odesk-merger-freelance-writers/" target="_blank">news that affects freelance writers</a>, and <a title="How will freelance writers earn well from longer blog posts?" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/how-freelance-writers-can-earn-from-long-blog-posts/" target="_blank">discuss trends</a>. Because this is a magazine for freelance writers.</p>
<p>When I started writing article-style posts back in 2008, I think I was a little ahead of the curve. But now, in-depth, fully reported blog posts &#8212; (cough) articles &#8212; are fast becoming the online norm.</p>
<p>If you like writing online, know that article format is the future.</p>
<p>Which makes sense, because readers want great stories and useful information. Fascinating interviews and unique facts. Always have, and always will. In the future, when they&#8217;re laser-beaming content into our brains, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll want.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know how yet, you should learn to deliver this.</p>
<h2>Reposition to earn more</h2>
<p>To sum up: stop writing &#8220;blog posts.&#8221; Stop thinking of yourself as a blogger. Become an article writer instead. If that idea scares you &#8212; of doing interviews and finding facts &#8212; I just want to say: You can do this.</p>
<p>Sell what you&#8217;re writing to clients as articles instead of blog posts. &#8220;Instead of short blog posts, we should create better content that&#8217;s article quality, with interviews and research data &#8212; that&#8217;s what builds authority and really gets you traffic and leads.&#8221; Then, ask for $.50-$1 a word for it.</p>
<p>Ride the trend toward better, article-style content and you&#8217;ll be positioned to earn more as a freelance writer in 2015. Then, you can write whatever you want on your own blog.</p>

<p>First, here are my five best tips for rounding up those stray checks:</p>
<p><span id="more-4044"></span></p>
<h2>1. Friendly email reminder</h2>
<p>I like to begin on the assumption that my lack of a payment is a simple oversight or mistake. The day after the payment was due, I send a friendly email:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m just checking in because my final payment on this project was due yesterday. I know you got my final draft a couple weeks ago &#8212; are we all set? Please let me know if you need anything from me, and do let me know when I can expect payment. Let me know if you need another copy of the invoice.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, that&#8217;s all it takes. The invoice was mislaid, or the accountant was out sick a couple days, and your nudge will send the check your way.</p>
<h2>2. Make the call</h2>
<p>No response to this friendly email? It&#8217;s time to try to get them live on the phone.</p>
<p>Many people are less evasive if you can get them on a call. They may give you a sob story about why it&#8217;s late (set phasers to &#8216;ignore&#8217;), but hopefully they&#8217;ll tell you when you can expect the check.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re too chicken to confront a client about an overdue bill, consider hiring a collections agency to help you, or enlist a friend to do it.</p>
<h2>3. Go up the chain</h2>
<p>After a live chat, if the check fails to arrive on the new (late) date they promised, I usually conclude I&#8217;m talking to the wrong person. It&#8217;s time to try someone else.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re talking to an editor, try the managing editor or editor-in-chief. Better yet, try the accounting department. Often, the bean-counters will tell you the editor has failed to send over your invoice for payment. Or they&#8217;ll reveal that the invoice came too late for this month&#8217;s cycle, so it&#8217;ll pay out in 30 days.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been working with a marketing manager at a company, try the chief finance offer (CFO) or their right hand.</p>
<p>Now, you at least know the problem, and can get back to the editor if it&#8217;s their mistake and they need to supply paperwork.</p>
<p>Editors will sometimes dodge these calls because they feel frustrated and helpless &#8212; they don&#8217;t sign the checks, and are often deeply unhappy that their writers are being jerked around. Hopefully, if it&#8217;s an oversight on their part, they&#8217;ll help.</p>
<h2>4. Bill a late fee</h2>
<p>In the absence of any satisfying responses on steps 1-3, I will sometimes re-submit my bill with a 2% monthly late fee (compounding) applied for the first month. For those of you who aren&#8217;t math dorks, that means next month, I&#8217;ll take this new larger amount and charge them 2% more based on that amount, not the original, lower fee. And so on.</p>
<p>Often, the late-fee bill will wake up the client and they&#8217;ll send a check.</p>
<p>They may only send the regular amount and not the late fee, but they decide it&#8217;s time to pay. The late fee makes them see that not only are you not going away, but you will actually expect more money from them, the longer they drag this out.</p>
<p>Once it&#8217;s clear that they can&#8217;t sit on the bill forever without consequence, it&#8217;s amazing how often deadbeats suddenly find the money they need to pay you.</p>
<h2>5. Social shaming</h2>
<p>I know &#8212; I feel ashamed to mention this. It&#8217;s a little bit mean, I admit. But it often works like a charm.</p>
<p>Publicly &#8216;outing&#8217; a deadbeat client in social media can really get them off the dime. Every company is paranoid about social-media reputation damage. So you&#8217;ll usually get a rapid response to a tweet like these:</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8220;@magazine &#8212; Still looking for my $1,000 article fee due 3 weeks ago. When may I expect it?&#8221;</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>&#8220;@company &#8212; Turned in my final draft 3 weeks ago. Payment now overdue. Please advise when I will see my check?&#8221;</p>
<p>OR, possibly worst:</p>
<p>&#8220;@writers &#8212; anyone else writing for @X company? Having trouble getting paid? Would like to connect&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>My social-shaming hint: Keep it professional. Don&#8217;t be rude or call names. Stick to the facts. Once they see that word of their irresponsibility may spread to their own clients, they&#8217;ll probably overnight you a check.</p>
<p>They owe you money, and it&#8217;s overdue. If you start flaming them, you may hurt your chances of getting paid instead of helping them.</p>
<h2>Stop working</h2>
<p>The other thing to do to protect yourself from deadbeat clients is to stop working on any ongoing assignments you have from that client. Slow payers earn a trip to the bottom of your priority list.</p>
<p>You might choose to let them know that this work stoppage has occurred, or you may decide to keep it under your hat. But you should move on immediately to either do other client work or to do marketing to find more clients.</p>
<p>After all, this payment may never arrive. Don&#8217;t get in deeper and rack up more bills with a client who may be getting ready to stiff you. I hear too many sad stories from writers who end up with $10,000 or more outstanding from a client who&#8217;s gone belly-up.</p>
<h2>Preventing the problem</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to prevent the late-payment scenario in the future, there are three key steps to getting prompt payments. You need to have a contract that defines when you get paid, you need to bill clients promptly, and then you must act immediately if payments are late.</p>
<p>One big pitfall many freelance writers fall into is they don&#8217;t have a contract at all. Or if they do, it doesn&#8217;t define how long the client has to pay you after you turn in your work. I prefer terms like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Final payment due on finalization or 14 days after receipt of final draft, whichever is sooner.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Get in the habit of invoicing clients immediately. That&#8217;s right &#8212; don&#8217;t wait around to hear that your draft has been accepted &#8212; send the bill with the first draft, so it gets in their payment cycle right away.</p>
<p>Some companies will take 30-60 days to cut a check and only pay contractors once a month. You don&#8217;t want any delays on your end that might cause you to miss a week they cut checks and leave you waiting another month.</p>
<p>You also need to set up a payment calendar so that you&#8217;re aware of the exact due date for each outstanding payment. The day after it&#8217;s due, if it isn&#8217;t in your hand, you should be using one of the five steps above to let the client know you noticed and care deeply that your payment arrive.</p>
<h2>Why suing is not the answer</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ll note one of my tips is NOT &#8216;take them to court.&#8217; It&#8217;s increasingly rare that pursuing payment via a lawsuit is a sane choice. Freelancing is increasingly a global business, and often, your deadbeat client will be in a different state or even a different country. This makes applying the law extremely difficult, as you might have to appear in court where they&#8217;re located.</p>
<p>But more importantly, suing does two bad things: It costs you money, and it messes with your head.</p>
<p>Unless you have at least $10,000 owed you, even going to small claims court, it&#8217;s not going to be worth it, between your lost work time and lawyer costs.</p>
<p>Worse, thinking about how this client screwed you all the time as you prep and pursue your lawsuit is very bad. This is not a climate that fosters productivity or finding great new clients.</p>
<p>If you try every approach and there&#8217;s still no payment, I offer one final option: Consider this lost money tuition in the school of freelance life.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking: &#8220;He ripped me off for $X thousands!&#8221; realize that this happened because of your own poor freelance business choices&#8230;and learn from it.</p>
<p>You need to qualify clients better in the future and go after more reputable companies and publications, so that you work with clients that pay their contractors &#8212; on time, and well.</p>

<p>But that’s exactly how long it took me to figure out how to get serious and treat my freelance career as a business.</p>
<p>I hope my story helps you figure it out a lot faster than that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-4059"></span></p>
<h2>I&#8217;m a freelancer?</h2>
<p>I did my first freelance writing in Seattle’s reality TV industry, when I was 23. During my interview with the production company, I was told the gig was temporary and would only last a few months.</p>
<p>It sounded great, so I accepted it — and the $13-an-hour salary that came with it.</p>
<p>But after talking with my coworkers, I found out I wasn’t a typical employee. In fact, I wasn’t an employee at all. I was a freelancer. And when they said the gig ended in March, they weren’t lying.</p>
<p>Over the next several years, I bounced around in gigs that lasted anywhere from three months to a year — with lapses of up to five months in between.</p>
<p>To survive, I took odd jobs doing everything from coaching soccer to selling cell phones. This hand-to-mouth cycle sucked, but seeing my name in the credits on TV made it seem worth it.</p>
<h2>Not making a living doing what I love</h2>
<p>Of course, reality (no pun intended!) eventually hit.</p>
<p>I was now 29, and had a six-week gig scripting TV. Talking with a fellow co-worker about money, I suddenly realized I made a higher hourly rate delivering pizzas than I did writing nationally broadcast TV.</p>
<p>That realization didn’t sit well with me, and I soon left.</p>
<p>I spent the next ten months in my hometown of Chicago, where my writing hit new lows. The only writing income I made was $25 from Fiverr.</p>
<p>Next, I decided to pack my bags and follow my girlfriend to Bangkok, Thailand. I took a job as an English teacher so I could survive while I figured things out.</p>
<h2>The turning point</h2>
<p>Last December, I read the book <em>Eat That Frog</em> by Brian Tracy. In the opening chapter, the author says the key to being successful at anything is to learn what other successful people are doing &#8212; and do the same.</p>
<p>This seemed obvious at first. But I realized that although I’d spent significant time developing my craft as a writer, I never cared to learn what successful freelancers were doing.</p>
<p>So I started learning. I joined the <a title="Freelance Writers Den" href="http://freelancewritersden.com" target="_blank">Freelance Writers Den</a>. On my hour-long commute to my full-time job, I read blogs and e-books by Ed Gandia, Danny Iny, and others. And I set aside 5 hours a week in the evenings to learn.</p>
<p>One big realization is that I had to stop fearing failure. I&#8217;ve started looking at all my business experiments as practice. If I fail, then it&#8217;s not a big deal. It&#8217;s just practice, and I&#8217;ll get better as I go along if I keep going.</p>
<h2>Taking action</h2>
<p>Another thing I realized? My biggest challenge was marketing. It was scary, and I hated it. But if I was ever going to actually make a living writing, I needed to suck it up.</p>
<p>I started by asking family and friends for referrals. No dice.</p>
<p>I sent letters of introduction to hotels that had poorly translated English websites. But none of them could afford a writer, so that was a dead end.</p>
<p>After about six months, I began<a title="7 Networking Tips for Cowards" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/7-networking-tips-for-cowards/" target="_blank"> going to local networking events</a> hosted by Meetup and the Chambers of Commerce in the embassies here in Bangkok. Once I took the advice of the freelancers I was following and started looking to make friends, not just find work, I started to really enjoy in-person networking.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when I started making progress. I eventually found all three of my current clients through networking.</p>
<h2>Finding clients</h2>
<p>My first client came this past August. I used the lessons I learned — and the templates provided — in the <a title="Freelance Business Bootcamp" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/ebooks" target="_blank">Freelance Business Bootcamp</a> offered within the Freelance Writers Den. It was the first time I ever created a freelance writing contract, negotiated the payment myself, and truly felt in control of my freelance destiny.</p>
<p>Eight years in, and I was finally acting like a real freelancer.</p>
<p>When I got three clients, I quit my full-time job. I have a great variety of work teaching writing to one client, writing video scripts for another, and writing content and web copy for a travel/backpacking site.</p>
<p>And even though some of the rates aren&#8217;t what I&#8217;d ask for now, I feel awesome that I negotiated them myself. My best rate — and my easiest client to work with — came when I entered the negotiation with a solid idea of what other people charged for that type of work and the knowledge that I could walk away if I didn&#8217;t get that rate. I&#8217;m actually prepping to re-negotiate one of my lower-paying clients, and I am ready to quit if they can&#8217;t meet my new rate.</p>
<h2>Having a good problem</h2>
<p>I’m drowning in work now, and I&#8217;ve turned down a few other clients already! I&#8217;m not sending out LOIs, but I am still attending networking events.</p>
<p>This whole &#8220;being swamped with clients&#8221; thing is kind of new to me. And it’s kind of scary.</p>
<p>So what am I doing? Same as before…learning how others handle <a title="How I became a more productive writer by doing this one simple thing" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/productive-writer-one-simple/" target="_blank">juggling multiple clients</a>, and doing the same myself.</p>

<p>Do you sometimes feel like an easily replaceable cog in the vast wheel that is the freelance writing marketplace?</p>
<p>If so, you're not alone.</p>
<p>With all the $5 or $10-a-post writing gigs online, it's easy to feel writing has simply become a cheap activity -- and that clients don't appreciate the work you do.</p>
<p>Here's one email I got recently that perfectly sums up the problem many writers face:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>"The thing I struggle with is that I am unable to land a gig where the client really values what I do. Since the clients I worked with have a number of writers on the rolls, they always treat each writer as just another disposable commodity. Which is worrying, because it means they will drop me any time they want.</p>
<p>"So how I do go about building a relationship where I'm not just another writer?"--Ryan</p></blockquote>
<p>Great question! That's exactly what you want to do if you're going to become a successful, well-paid freelance writer. Here's how:</p>

<p>&#8220;So how I do go about building a relationship where I&#8217;m not just another writer?&#8221;&#8211;Ryan</p></blockquote>
<p>Great question! That&#8217;s exactly what you want to do if you&#8217;re going to become a successful, well-paid freelance writer. Here are seven ways to get there:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-3723"></span></p>
<h2>1. Learn to qualify prospects</h2>
<p>First off, to get paid well, you have to find companies that have serious money available to pay you. They&#8217;re successful.</p>
<p>In general, they sell a real product or service in the real world. And they&#8217;ve been around a few years.</p>
<p>Realize that most Craigslist advertisers, and most online platforms promising you great &#8220;opportunities,&#8221; simply aren&#8217;t the client you want. Yes, it&#8217;s so easy to sign up for those&#8230;but you&#8217;ll be caught in the disposable-commodity trap.</p>
<p>You <a title="Get great freelance clients" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/get-great-freelance-clients/" target="_blank">get better clients</a> by researching prospects, identifying good ones &#8212; or finding magazines that pay good rates &#8212; and proactively marketing to them.</p>
<p>When you contact these prospects, they&#8217;ll be looking to build relationships with good writers, because they&#8217;re doing *real* business, not waiting for ad-clicks on a website. They don&#8217;t have time to be constantly auditioning new writers.</p>
<h2>2. Avoid the masses</h2>
<p>I have yet to see an online platform with hundreds of writers working for it that pays well. There is no such business model.</p>
<p>The presence of many writers working for a single client creates an atmosphere that devalues our skills. It&#8217;s also often impossible to build a relationship, because the work is done through an anonymous platform where you may not even know the end client&#8217;s identity.</p>
<p>Any ad you see from a place gushing about how they&#8217;re hiring dozens of writers and have *loads* or work for you, be wary. In my experience, that&#8217;s code for &#8220;I pay crap, and think of writers as Kleenex I can quickly use up and discard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Set phasers to ignore, and move on to find successful companies to work for.</p>
<h2>3. Meet live humans</h2>
<p>Getting out and talking to prospects in person is a great way to find better clients. Even if it&#8217;s a small business with a small marketing budget, I think they&#8217;re less likely to pay you a shockingly low wage when you&#8217;ve met face-to-face. It&#8217;s also a great way to build meaningful relationships with contacts who might do more than hire you &#8212; they might recommend and refer you.</p>
<h2>4. Build authority</h2>
<p>One of the most accessible ways writers can start from scratch and begin earning well is to grab attention online, through their own blog or guest posting for big blogs.</p>
<p>Write on topics that will show your writing expertise to best advantage. I can tell you, the best-paying clients I&#8217;ve gotten in recent years all approached me after seeing my writing on popular blogs. That includes both of my <a title="How to start your business on a shoestring" href="http://shoestringstartup.com" target="_blank">traditional print book</a> contracts. Good clients are doing online searches to find the right writer, because it saves them a ton of time over placing an ad or asking around.</p>
<p>When the client approaches you, they&#8217;re <em>dying</em> to build a relationship with you. They&#8217;ve decided you are the writer they simply must have for their project.</p>
<h2>5. Specialize in a topic</h2>
<p>Another way to build authority that reliably works is to choose a topic area and keep writing on it. The more you research and write on a topic, the more sophisticated your knowledge becomes. That allows you to move up to bigger, better-paying clients over time.</p>
<p>This is exactly how I went from writing for an alternative city paper to a business weekly to a regional business monthly magazine, to <em>Entrepreneur</em> and <em>Forbes</em>. I chugged along covering startups, franchising, and business finance, building my source list and learning more, until I could command top magazine rates for my stories.</p>
<h2>6. Know a product</h2>
<p>If there is a type of product you enjoy learning about, this can be a great way to build expertise. Maybe it&#8217;s apps, software-as-a-service, oil drilling, or jewelry-making. When you&#8217;ve written about one, start marketing your services to other companies that sell a similar thing.</p>
<p>In any complex industry, finding good writers is a nightmare for companies. And they don&#8217;t have time to teach anybody the fine points. If you know their product, they are thrilled to find you and pay you well to stick around.</p>
<h2>7. Sell value instead of hours</h2>
<p>This requires a massive mindshift &#8212; but if you do it, you can earn a lot more.</p>
<p>Writers tend to have a wage-slave, starvation mentality. Many tell me they&#8217;re happy to get $17 an hour for writing or editing, because they imagine they can squeak by on that&#8230;and are worried they&#8217;ll be out of a gig if they ask for professional rates.</p>
<p>Now, flip this equation over. If you write for businesses especially, stop basing what you charge on your life circumstances, past pay rates you&#8217;ve earned at your day jobs, or the total of your monthly bills.</p>
<p>Instead, think of the value you&#8217;re delivering to the client. Will the sales page or brochure or Web copy you&#8217;re writing enable that client to bring in $100,000 more business? You deserve a cut of that. Considered this way, a $5,000 fee is peanuts compared to all that new revenue for the client &#8212; and that&#8217;s how you pitch it in your proposal.</p>
<p>Selling value instead of hours is the approach that builds great client relationships, and puts freelance writers into the six-figure annual earning category.</p>

<p>I did a paid trial piece using the voice I saw on their blog. </p>
<p>It turns out they didn’t like their voice and wanted to go in a different direction. They asked me how I saw myself “fitting in” — a clear sign of doubt. </p>

They had already gone through two sub-par writers, so they were wary of hiring another freelance writer.</p>
<p>I did a paid trial piece, using the voice I saw on their blog.</p>
<p>It turns out, they didn’t like their voice and wanted to go in a different direction. They asked me how I saw myself “fitting in” — a clear sign of doubt.</p>
<p>So I asked for a meeting. Drawing on my background as a slam poet, I paid attention to the way the client spoke and asked questions about their desired voice. The client left the meeting hopeful and satisfied. I won their trust, and I did it using slam poetry.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how &#8212; and why &#8212; I became the one writer this client wanted to work with:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-4091"></span></p>
<h2>What is slam poetry?</h2>
<p>Slam poetry ain’t your mama’s poetry.</p>
<p>Poetry is what makes English students want to light themselves on fire.</p>
<p>Slam poetry is hip-hop music’s eccentric cousin. It’s about wordplay and storytelling, not strict adherence to an arbitrary structure.</p>
<h2>Find the right voice</h2>
<p>My client’s primary concern was voice.</p>
<p>In copywriting, a business’ voice can impact sales. This client thought their voice was too formal, and they wanted more modern content.</p>
<p>Slam poetry has helped me <a title="How Creative Writing Made Me a Better Blogger" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/creative-writing-blogger/" target="_blank">master voice</a>. If you’re struggling with your “writing voice,” listen to different poets. You’ll uncover the devices they use to create a distinct voice, and you can try different tactics to help you do the same.</p>
<h2>Choose words wisely</h2>
<p>The words you choose convey a lot of information about you.</p>
<p>If you want clients to identify with you, you need to talk like them. Spoken word works by using the right word in the right place at the right time. Certain words have persuasive power, and certain other words can have negative connotations.</p>
<p>I noticed that my client used warm and casual words. By choosing more informal language, I was able to connect with her on a personal level.</p>
<h2>Pop-culture shortcuts build rapport</h2>
<p>Who doesn’t love a well-placed pop culture reference? Spoken-word poetry, a performance by nature, is all about speaker-audience interaction and shared stories.</p>
<p><a title="The Carly Simon Guide to Freelance Superstardom" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/carly-simon-guide-overcoming-freelance-fears-achieving-superstardom/" target="_blank">Pop culture references</a> are a great way to quickly create solidarity with your audience.</p>
<p>My client said she’d send me an email, to which I replied, “awesome possum!” Unbeknownst to me, that slang term’s been around for decades. So my client, who is 20 years my senior, laughed and said that she hadn’t heard that expression in years. This one little phrase established an instant rapport!</p>
<p>Slam poetry might seem intimidating at first, but it’s actually quite easy. It doesn’t follow traditional rules, so you don’t need to know anything about sonnets to write it. The tools you learn from slam can even net you new clients.</p>
<p>In just two short weeks I’ve already earned an extra couple hundred dollars — and I owe it to slam.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4092" src="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/photodune-3358341-crazy-clown-excited-to-hold-a-bag-of-money-xs-278x300.jpg" alt="Easy money" width="278" height="300" />Have you wondered if there&#8217;s a point at which the freelance writing life gets easier? I get asked that a lot.</p>
<p>Writers get sick of the hustle and grind of trying to scare up more gigs. Or they tire of being broke all the time.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t there an easier way to earn more money as a freelance writer?</p>
<p>As it happens, there is.</p>
<p>There is one great way to earn more money as a freelance writer that doesn&#8217;t rely on marketing. It&#8217;s my favorite way to earn more, too, as it does not involve working any harder.</p>
<p>Bonus: Now is the perfect time of year to lay the groundwork and make this happen.</p>
<p><span id="more-4029"></span></p>
<h2>What do you charge?</h2>
<p>The simplest way to grow your income as a freelance writer is to get paid more to do what you&#8217;re already doing. In other words, get a raise from your existing clients.</p>
<p>No marketing needed &#8212; no auditioning, writing sample articles, answering ads, going to networking events, sending queries, nothing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so simple! Yet so many writers fail to take advantage of this great opportunity to earn more.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that for this to work, you need to already have clients. And they need to be the right type of client &#8212; the kind where you can get a raise &#8212; <a title="Writing for content mills writers' true stories" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/write-content-mills-writers-true-stories/" target="_blank">not a content mill</a> where they&#8217;ve been paying $15 or $20 for articles for years, and it&#8217;ll never change. Or a revenue-share situation where you earn pennies for ad clicks. Only a miracle will earn you more at these sort of places.</p>
<p>My experience in mentoring hundreds of writers is that new writers often bid too low, and then rarely ask clients for more money. Even though over time, their expertise in that client&#8217;s business and their sector usually grow dramatically.</p>
<p>Often, all you have to do is get more is simply to ask. If you&#8217;ve been writing for a client for 60-90 days, you can often get a raise at that early point. That&#8217;s enough time to make yourself indispensable to the client. You don&#8217;t have to wait a year or more!</p>
<p>Some writers tell me they <a title="5 signs you're ready to raise your freelance rates" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/5-signs-ready-raise-freelance-rates/" target="_blank">don&#8217;t feel ready</a> to ask for a raise yet, or they need to gain <a title="How to feel confident charging more as a freelance writer" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/freelancers-feel-confident-charging/" target="_blank">confidence that they&#8217;re worth more</a>.</p>
<p>Let me help: You&#8217;re worth more. Yes, I can tell from here.</p>
<p>Why is now the best time to get a raise? Well, my <a title="Raise your freelance writing rates" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/raise-freelance-writing-rates/" target="_blank">proven approach to getting raises</a> takes six weeks to execute. Six weeks from now, it&#8217;s a new year. That&#8217;s why this is the perfect moment.</p>
<h2>6 Weeks to more money</h2>
<p>If you give your client a lot of notice near year-end, it&#8217;s fairly easy to get a raise. I&#8217;ll demonstrate why. It takes six weeks for this method to play out &#8212; here are the steps:</p>
<p>1) Notify your client this week that your rates are going up starting in 2015. I suggest a simple script along these lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For some time now, my rates have been rising, but I&#8217;ve kept your rate stable because I love working with you. However, at this point I won&#8217;t be working at this rate in future. I&#8217;m writing to let you know that starting in 2015, my rates are going up from $X to $X (usually 10%-15% more).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>2) Client gets note. Scans it. Sees it says something&#8217;s happening in &#8220;2015.&#8221; Client makes a mental note that this isn&#8217;t something urgent that&#8217;s happening this week. They don&#8217;t have to think about it right now. They can go back to the million emergencies they&#8217;re dealing with because it&#8217;s almost year-end.</p>
<p>3) If you don&#8217;t hear back, you&#8217;ve got two options. Get back in touch and insist they sign a revised contract, or simply start charging more on Jan. 1. You know <a title="Why writers earn more with a simple piece of paper" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/freelance-writers-earn-more-simple-paper/" target="_blank">I recommend having a contract</a>, but your call. I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;ve used the sneaky approach in the past, and it&#8217;s worked out.</p>
<p>4) If you haven&#8217;t gotten confirmation yet, remind them right before Christmas that your rates are going up.</p>
<p>5) Client is headed out the door for the holidays, and realizes time got away from them on this one. Now, they&#8217;ll never find a replacement for you before Jan. 1. They think about it and realize they like your work, and it&#8217;s probably not worth the effort to break in a new writer &#8212; it&#8217;s easier to just pay you a little more.</p>
<p>6) When you bill for January work, you&#8217;re at the higher rate.</p>
<p>One tip: I&#8217;ve found asking for a modest raise pretty foolproof. But I also know writers who were being radically underpaid, who asked for and got 50%-100% raises. So consider your situation and your client, and think carefully about how big a raise you want to shoot for.</p>
<p>Small raises increase your odds that clients will simply agree without giving it a lot of thought, but sometimes the pay is so low you should either quit or get a substantial raise.</p>
<h2>When you can&#8217;t ask for more</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s one big rule of asking for a raise from an existing client: You can&#8217;t do it unless you&#8217;re ready to walk if they don&#8217;t agree.</p>
<p>If they say &#8216;no&#8217; to the raise and you stay, they&#8217;ll never respect you again. This client is now a dead end. You&#8217;ll never earn more here.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re absolutely petrified about asking existing clients for a raise, or simply not in the scenario where you can risk losing the client, you can still help yourself earn more.</p>
<p>How? Raise your rates for new clients.</p>
<p>Grandfather in your old clients at your existing rate, but anybody new pays more. Then, gradually replace those older clients with the higher-paying ones as you go. Once again, this doesn&#8217;t add to your marketing workload &#8212; it&#8217;s just part of what you tell prospects.</p>
<p><em><strong>Will you raise your rates in 2015?</strong> </em>Leave a comment and tell us how you&#8217;ll make it happen.</p>

<p>I’m afraid of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>I don’t mean the financial kind. I mean the kind where you get an exciting writing commission, and then you can't deliver.</p>
<p>Creative bankruptcy happens when you have a pressing writing project — and you know you’ve got nothing.</p>
<p>Don’t put yourself in that position.</p>
<p>Here are three ways you can avoid creative bankruptcy and become a more productive professional writer.</p>

<p>I don’t mean the financial kind. I mean the kind where you get an exciting writing commission, and then you can&#8217;t deliver.</p>
<p>Creative bankruptcy happens when you have a pressing writing project — and you know you’ve got nothing.</p>
<p>Don’t put yourself in that position.</p>
<p>Here are three ways you can avoid creative bankruptcy and become a more productive professional writer.</p>
<p><span id="more-4048"></span></p>
<h2>1. Research your idols and competitors</h2>
<p>Don’t reinvent the wheel with each new writing project. Instead, research what the writers you admire are creating content about.</p>
<p><a title="Buzzsumo" href="http://buzzsumo.com/" target="_blank">BuzzSumo</a> and <a title="Social Crawlytics" href="https://socialcrawlytics.com/" target="_blank">Social Crawlytics</a> are two tools you can use to find that out.</p>
<p>Using BuzzSumo, you can find key influencers and see what type of content they created. You can also search a blog or website for popular posts by topic or author.</p>
<p>With Social Crawlytics, you can analyze a website or blog and find popular articles, according to their social shares.</p>
<h2>2. Invest in your creativity bank</h2>
<p>Professional writers need a creativity bank for depositing ideas.</p>
<p>If you have one, the next time you are creatively bankrupt, you can withdraw from your savings account of ideas and keep earning for your writing.</p>
<p>To build your creativity bank, get into the habit of recording five or ten ideas for topics you want to write about or ideas you have for future assignments.</p>
<p>Don’t judge these ideas. It doesn’t matter how good they are. And you don’t need to act on them. The point is to record them.</p>
<p>Do this for seven days, and you’ll have 35–70 ideas. Do it for a month, and you’ll have 150–300 ideas. Plus, you’ll also have a lot of <a title="2 ways to become that writer with a million story ideas" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/2-ways-writer-million-story-ideas/" target="_blank">practice coming up with ideas</a> — so you can draw on those skills when you need something new.</p>
<h2>3. Take the pressure off</h2>
<p>Writing is demanding — and those of us who put words on the page for money feel an extra pressure to create.</p>
<p>If you’re having an unproductive day (or year), reduce your expectations and lower the bar.</p>
<p>Focus on progressing on your current project in some small way.</p>
<p>If you’re having trouble finishing your article, settle for writing five headlines.</p>
<p>Instead of writing your next chapter, outline it.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about completing five interviews &#8212; just schedule them.</p>
<p>Lowering the bar enables you to end the day without experiencing a sense of failure. Sometimes, just turning up is a win.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not advocating procrastination. Instead, your goal should be to move your project along in small increments and then take a break and <a title="The Impulsive Writer’s Productivity Secret: 3 Reasons to Write What You Want" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/how-i-earned-by-writing-now/" target="_blank">complete it when you&#8217;re rested</a>.</p>
<p>If all else fails, ask your client for an extension &#8212; you&#8217;d be surprised how often that&#8217;s no big deal.</p>
<h2>Your path to creative prosperity</h2>
<p>Being a professional writer is tough. But you have tools you can use to keep yourself working, even when you don’t feel inspired.</p>
<p>Check what your competitors are doing. Make sure you have a bank of ideas you can reuse. And if you’re really stuck, go a little easier on yourself.</p>

<p>Many new writers looking to find that first place they can break in and start earning money from their craft end up signing up for a content mill.</p>
<p>Either that, or they end up discovering a revenue-share site like <a title="How I make a full time living blogging on examiner" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/full-time-living-blogging-examiner/" target="_blank">Examiner</a> or <a title="Writing for Guardian Liberty Voice" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/writing-for-guardian-liberty-voice/" target="_blank">Guardian Liberty Voice</a>, or <a title="Bidding on Elance - how freelancers get screwed" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/bidding-on-elance-how-freelancers-get-screwed/" target="_blank">bidding for gigs on Elance</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after, many of these writers send me emails like this one:</p>

<p>Either that, or they end up discovering a revenue-share site like <a title="How I make a full time living blogging on examiner" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/full-time-living-blogging-examiner/" target="_blank">Examiner</a> or <a title="Writing for Guardian Liberty Voice" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/writing-for-guardian-liberty-voice/" target="_blank">Guardian Liberty Voice</a>, or <a title="Bidding on Elance - how freelancers get screwed" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/bidding-on-elance-how-freelancers-get-screwed/" target="_blank">bidding for gigs on Elance</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after, many of these writers are sending me emails like this one:</p>
<p><span id="more-4009"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a new writer and I was thinking about signing up for Textbroker. What do you think about them?</p>
<p>&#8220;I also registered for Demand Studios &#8212; waiting for approval &#8212; and created a Fiverr profile. I was wondering what your opinion is of those, or if there is a better site I should join?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>The myth of the better content mill</h2>
<p>Aah, the worry that maybe you&#8217;ve chosen the wrong content mill.</p>
<p>Hope springs eternal within writers&#8217; hearts, that somewhere on our vast interwebs, there could be a content mill that pays great. Or a revenue-share site where your posts would earn you a small fortune in affiliate ad revenue, or a mass bidding platform where prices won&#8217;t be nearly nil.</p>
<p>You think maybe, it&#8217;s just a matter of looking harder. Because there must be some mistake, right? You&#8217;re making a pittance here!</p>
<p>Insecure writers tend to blame themselves when things go wrong. It must be me, we think. If only I were a better writer or researcher, I could discover the Valhalla where you write keyword-stuffed quickie content on any topic you like, that doesn&#8217;t require interviews, expertise, or much research &#8212; but it still pays terrific.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem to matter how much reporting I do on <a title="Content mill founder quits will freelance writers follow" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/content-mill-founder-quits-will-freelance-writers-follow/" target="_blank">why content mills&#8217; business model is failing</a> and won&#8217;t ever offer a living wage to writers. (Have you checked out what&#8217;s happened to the <a title="Seeking Alpha DMD" href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/2676575-update-demand-media-reports-q3-earnings-but-is-still-an-avoid" target="_blank">stock of Demand Studios</a>&#8216; parent Demand Media lately, since they spun off their domain-name business and have only the content mills left? Investors get it.)</p>
<p>Still comes the question: &#8220;Which is the best content mill for me to join?&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like to be the person who bursts writers&#8217; bubbles, but there is no best content mill. Wish there was&#8230;but no.</p>
<h2>Taking bad advice</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to see how writers get sucked into this dream, that a better content mill is out there, somewhere.</p>
<p>After all, there so many posts online about the best content mills to join! I did a Google search recently, and found &#8220;best content mills&#8221; gets 106 million results.</p>
<p>I turned up insightful advice, such as that the secret is to &#8220;<a title="5 best content mills" href="http://onlinemoneymaking4all.com/5-best-content-mills-for-making-money-online/" target="_blank">join as many as you can</a>.&#8221; As if trying to keep up with one mill&#8217;s arcane rules, editor demands, and weird topic requests isn&#8217;t enough.</p>
<p>Scan these &#8220;best content mill&#8221; posts, and you&#8217;ll often learn their recommended, best, top mills pay $3 an article. So much better than the ones that only pay $1!</p>
<p>I always hope that alarm bells will ring for writers as they see these rates&#8230;that there&#8217;ll be a &#8220;wait a minute&#8221; gut-check, and they&#8217;ll move on and look for decent-paying clients. But for many, the lure of easy money is too great.</p>
<h2>Changing your vision</h2>
<p>Soon, these same writers are asking me if I can teach them how to write fast enough to crank out ten articles a day &#8212; because that&#8217;s the only way they&#8217;ll earn enough to survive at a mill. And mills are all many writers know.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a crisis of lack of vision. If you can&#8217;t conceive that there is any better writing gig out there, content mills are where you write.</p>
<p>I heard just this week from one writer who wanted to know if $25 was a good article rate or not. She&#8217;d recently moved up from a $10 article mill, and her editor was telling her she was lucky to repeatedly revise her articles for him at this magnificent rate. That this was pretty much the top rate.</p>
<p>I told her the <a title="How I wrote a $2,000 freelance article in a week flat" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/high-paid-freelance-article-writing/" target="_blank">last article I wrote paid $2,000</a>. When I got paid for my first essay in the late 1980s, I got $200.</p>
<p>If a raise from $10 to $25 is super-exciting to you, and you can feed your family on that, then ignore this whole article and write for mills.</p>
<p>But from where I sit, it&#8217;s not going to make a meaningful difference for anyone writing in any first world country. Writing for content mills will never get you in the ballpark of replacing your day-job income.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a whole alternative universe of great-paying writing markets out there. But <a title="Can you really earn a living as a freelance writer?" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/earn-living-freelance-writer/" target="_blank">you have to believe they exist</a> &#8212; and then you have to be willing to expend some effort to find them.</p>
<h2>5 Basic laws of writing online</h2>
<p>Given how often I&#8217;m getting asked which content mill is best, I thought it might be helpful to put together a concise list of basics to know when looking for writing gigs online. Consider these my five<a title="Natural laws of freelance writing" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/3-natural-laws-freelance-writing-understand-earn/" target="_blank"> business laws for freelance writers</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Content mills, by definition, must underpay writers. Whenever mass content is needed, prices must be low, or the mill won&#8217;t turn a profit for its owners.</li>
<li>Revenue share sites can only pay based on your traffic &#8212; which will mostly be tiny. Don&#8217;t write for them without at least <a title="How I learned to love writing for revenue share" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/revenue-share-websites-learned-love/" target="_blank">some guaranteed revenue</a>.</li>
<li>Mass job bidding sites will always offer mostly rock-bottom prices.</li>
<li>Anywhere thousands of writers are present, market forces will drive prices down, down, down. It will be difficult to earn professional rates.</li>
<li>The only proven approach for building a lucrative freelance income is proactively prospecting to find your own clients.</li>
</ol>
<p>To sum up, it&#8217;s not you &#8212; it&#8217;s the business model of mass writing and bidding platforms. Trying to find a better content mill is like trying to find a spot on the Earth where there isn&#8217;t gravity. It doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t waste your time switching from one content mill or big freelance-gig website to another, or signing up for many sites in hopes that one will be a winner. That&#8217;s time you could spend <a title="Get great freelance clients " href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/get-great-freelance-clients/" target="_blank">finding great clients</a> who respect the value you bring, and pay you appropriately.</p>

<p>With a deep breath, I pressed "send" on an email containing months of research and my first article for a <a title="Caroltice.com - 5 good paying writing niches" href="http://www.caroltice.com/5-good-paying-writing-niches" target="_blank">trade magazine</a>.</p>
<p>It was done!</p>
<p>But my excitement was short-lived when my editor replied. I'd called her the wrong name. I screwed up before she even looked at my story.</p>
<p>I panicked. Would she blacklist me? Would she even read my pitch now? Did I just cut myself out of a potentially great freelance writing gig?</p>
<p>Turns out, it all worked out okay. One year later, I'm her editorial assistant.</p>
<p>How did I get myself out of this jam and land a great freelance gig? I focused on three E's.</p>

<p>It was done!</p>
<p>But my excitement was short-lived when my editor replied. I&#8217;d called her the wrong name. I screwed up before she even looked at my story.</p>
<p>I panicked. Would she blacklist me? Would she even read my pitch now? Did I just cut myself out of a potentially great freelance writing gig?</p>
<p>Turns out, it all worked out okay. One year later, I&#8217;m her editorial assistant.</p>
<p>How did I get myself out of this jam and land a great freelance gig? I focused on three E&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-4020"></span></p>
<h2>Excellence</h2>
<p>I immediately replied to the editor with an apology. Thankfully, <a title="How to Conquer Your Terror of Screwing Up a Freelance Writing Gig" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/conquer-terror-screwing-freelance-writing-gig/" target="_blank">my gaffe would be forgotten,</a> because my story on virtual assistants was the best I&#8217;d written in a while.</p>
<p>She gave me another assignment! In return, every email was professional, my stories were done well and on time. Naturally, I always double-checked to make sure I called her by her correct name. At one point, she said I was a great writer. (I saved that email.)</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>For Your Checklist</strong><br />
Step one in maintaining a great writer-editor relationship: create high-quality work in a timely fashion. Use the best sources you can find, adjust to the publication&#8217;s writing style and complete edits immediately.</p></blockquote>
<p>Always over-deliver.</p>
<h2>Empathy</h2>
<p>I noticed a few things about my editor. She sometimes takes a while to respond. I&#8217;d have to send multiple copies of an invoice.</p>
<p>Turns out, she was overwhelmed with work. She revealed her job encompassed far more than editing the magazine. I became a welcome ear.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>For Your Checklist</strong><br />
It&#8217;s easier to be annoyed with your editor than empathize with her. But try it, even if it&#8217;s tough.</p></blockquote>
<p>If an editor apologizes for a late email, tell her you understand — everyone&#8217;s juggling work. Get to know her as a person and not a faceless entity behind an email address.</p>
<h2>Enthusiasm</h2>
<p>She was opening up to me, and I was grateful. One day, I emailed her jokingly that I wanted to move to where the magazine was published so I could work for her full time.</p>
<p>Apparently this gave her an idea. In a later email, she asked about helping more with the magazine. I&#8217;d get assigned features and assist with other sections.</p>
<p>A few phone calls later, it was done. I was an editorial assistant. The best part? She was so grateful for the help and included me in planning for 2015. My editor valued my input.</p>
<p>I made my excitement known and continue to do so. Generally, I don&#8217;t use emoticons and exclamation points in professional email correspondence. I broke that rule when I got this opportunity. I&#8217;m always grateful to do the work, even when it&#8217;s difficult.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>For Your Checklist</strong><br />
Being enthusiastic implies, &#8220;I love my work, and I want more.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep. <a title="Can This Heartfelt Emotion Guide You to Better Freelance Clients?" href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/emotion-guide-freelance-clients/" target="_blank">Excitement equals assignments.</a></p>
<p>Your editors may not react the same way mine did, but trust me, these three E&#8217;s will take you a long way in your writing career.</p>
