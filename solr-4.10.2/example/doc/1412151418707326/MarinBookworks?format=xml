<h3>e-Book Cover Design Award Winner for November 2014 in Fiction</h3>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">James Egan</font> submitted <strong>The Secret Heart</strong> designed by James T. Egan of Bookfly Design.<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Heart-Better-Angels-Book-ebook/dp/B00PA0EE8E/"><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-Secret-Heart.png" alt="cover design" width="300" height="449" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35082" /></a><br />
<img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ECA-Nov-2014-Fiction.png" alt="cover design" width="230" height="199" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35080" /><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>An absolutely sumptuous cover in which every element, every level of detail the designer has introduced plays a part. The careful type treatments and appropriate textural elements all help to convey both the languor of the scene and the period look and feel.</p>
<h3>e-Book Cover Design Award Winner for November 2014 in Nonfiction</h3>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Betsy Kruger</font> submitted <strong>Aesop&#8217;s Keys to Profitable Marketing</strong> designed by 1106 Design.<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aesops-Profitable-Marketing-Betsy-Kruger-ebook/dp/B00ONEJCP8/"><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Aesop.png" alt="cover design" width="300" height="452" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35083" /></a><br />
<img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ECA-Nov-2014-Nonfiction.png" alt="cover design" width="230" height="199" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35081" /><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>This delightful and perfectly targeted cover is so appealing it draws you right in. Who&#8217;s the dog and why is he on the cover? When it&#8217;s this inviting, who cares?</p>
<h3>Fiction Covers</h3>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">A.D. STARRLING</font> submitted <strong>KING&#8217;S CRUSADE (SEVENTEEN BOOK 2)</strong> designed by GLENDON HADDIX, STREETLIGHT GRAPHICS. &#8220;Streetlight Graphics have designed the books and short stories in this thriller series with the same &#8220;dark feel&#8221; in mind. This is the brightest cover of the series so far and it fits in perfectly with the plot and the main character of the novel. I love that fiery sky.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/KINGS-CRUSADE.jpg" alt="KING'S CRUSADE (SEVENTEEN BOOK 2)" title="KING'S CRUSADE (SEVENTEEN BOOK 2)" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Dark and attractive with a hint of mystery.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Adrijus G.</font> submitted <strong>Affliction Z: Patient Zero</strong> designed by RockingBookCovers.com. &#8220;Book 1 in a series.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Affliction-Z-Patient-Zero.jpg" alt="Affliction Z: Patient Zero" title="Affliction Z: Patient Zero" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Good tension, although I initially read the author&#8217;s name as &#8220;lieutenant&#8221; probably because of the proximity to the &#8220;uniformed&#8221; figure.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Adrijus G.</font> submitted <strong>Dead South Rising</strong> designed by RockingBookCovers.com.&#8221;Book 1 of Dead South Rising series. Both submitted. :)&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Dead-South-Rising.jpg" alt="Dead South Rising" title="Dead South Rising" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Very good series concept with stylish design and a cool type treatment.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Adrijus G.</font> submitted <strong>Dead South Rising: Death Row</strong> designed by RockingBookCovers.com.&#8221;Book 2 of Dead South Rising. Book 1 is also submitted.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Dead-South-Rising-Death-Row.jpg" alt="Dead South Rising: Death Row" title="Dead South Rising: Death Row" width="200" /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Adrijus G.</font> submitted <strong>The Wayward Journey</strong> designed by<br />
RockingBookCovers.com.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-Wayward-Journey.jpg" alt="The Wayward Journey" title="The Wayward Journey" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Here the tortured title type doesn&#8217;t add anything to the cover.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Aldrea Alien</font> submitted <strong>Golden Dawn</strong> designed by Cora Graphics.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Golden-Dawn.jpg" alt="Golden Dawn" title="Golden Dawn" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A lot of care was taken with the title and it contributes to the overall effect.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Alex Stargazer</font> submitted <strong>The Necromancer</strong> designed by Kit Foster. &#8220;This is Kit&#8217;s design for the print cover, but I decided it was better than the eCover even at thumbnail. It is meant to showcase a prominent theme (ice) and also: the contrast between gold and blue can represent the Necromancer&#8217;s dichotomous inner thoughts.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-Necromancer.jpg" alt="The Necromancer" title="The Necromancer" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I like the concept but it does indeed look better for a print book since the title will start to &#8220;break up&#8221; when reduced to thumbnail size.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Alice Catherine Carter</font> submitted <strong>The Broken Poppy</strong> designed by Emma Carter. &#8220;My sister Emma Carter painted the poppy on the front cover. The title was formatted through amazon&#8217;s free designs.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-Broken-Poppy.jpg" alt="The Broken Poppy" title="The Broken Poppy" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Unfortunately it looks like you got what you paid for.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Ally Shields</font> submitted <strong>Cross Keys, An Elvenrude Novel</strong> designed by Etopia Press.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CrossKeys.jpg" alt="Cross Keys, An Elvenrude Novel" title="Cross Keys, An Elvenrude Novel" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A very standard genre cover.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Amy Hillsberg</font> submitted <strong>Griffin Blade and the Bronze Finger</strong> designed by Tessa Avila. &#8220;This is an epic fantasy novel about a good-hearted thief that goes on a quest to discover the secret of a series of gems that wield power when held by the right person or being. We are especially happy with the title font choice and the electric-feeling current running across the cover. Thank you!&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Griffin-Blade-and-the-Bronze-Finger.jpg" alt="Griffin Blade and the Bronze Finger" title="Griffin Blade and the Bronze Finger" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I agree that the title is strong, but the rest of the cover just doesn&#8217;t match up very well. It&#8217;s impossible even at this size to read the background as &#8220;electric&#8221; and the way the illustration is used doesn&#8217;t help.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Andrew Browne</font> submitted <strong>The Comet&#8217;s Tale</strong> designed by Andrew Paul Browne. &#8220;There is a system of symbols designed for the jacket and interior of this novel. The cover is designed to communicate the fantastical and cosmic qualities of this self-published work. The book stands alone but also serves to promote the travels and inspirations of the author (who is an artist).&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-Comets-Tale.jpg" alt="The Comet's Tale" title="The Comet's Tale" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>The art is impressive although it can&#8217;t be appreciated at this size, and that&#8217;s a bit of a problem. And who is the author? Don&#8217;t know, the cover doesn&#8217;t say.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Barbara Loos</font> submitted <strong>Disillusioned</strong> designed by Scarlett Rugers. &#8220;The book takes place in Italy. Venice is the most popular recognizable city that is uniquely Italy. The main character has his first introduction in Venice as he is a documentary producer whose goal in life is to record Italy’s past history and finds himself having to take on Italy’s future.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Disillusioned.jpg" alt="Disillusioned" title="Disillusioned" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A clever design that looks like it&#8217;s &#8220;crushing&#8221; the title, which has not been distinguished very well from the author name. But a gorgeous visual for sure.<br />
<span id="more-35043"></span></p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Barry Finlay</font> submitted <strong>The Vanishing Wife</strong> designed by Tom Nickerson at ShokVox Productions. &#8220;The cover is representative of the storyline. The hero, an accountant, must reluctantly exchange his spreadsheets for a Glock 17 to find his wife who has disappeared. The gun is shaded to represent his reluctance. The bright colours are meant to attract attention.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-Vanishing-Wife.jpg" alt="The Vanishing Wife" title="The Vanishing Wife" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Not really a fan of the large expanses of flat black, and what purpose do the orange rules serve other than a distraction?</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Biju Vasudevan</font> submitted <strong>The Contract</strong> designed by Biju Vasudevan and Partridge. &#8220;Hi ! I have been following your steady relentless progress with immense delight n satisfaction. Greetings and Respects&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-Contract.jpg" alt="The Contract" title="The Contract" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Biju, I thought no one had noticed my relentless progress! Thanks. This is your standard stock-photo-with-type cover, very little to attract the reader&#8217;s interest.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Brian Gonzalez</font> submitted <strong>The Tides of Altamar</strong> designed by Brian Gonzalez. &#8220;The challenge for this cover: Fill it while still drawing the viewer into the vastness of space. I chose a modified Yin &#8211; Yang composition for balance and an orange-purple split complementary color scheme for optical punch and used many translucent layers to approximate the richness of oil paints.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-Tides-of-Altamar.jpg" alt="The Tides of Altamar" title="The Tides of Altamar" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>The artwork has promise and I like the &#8220;worlds in collision&#8221; but the overworked type and many strong type elements are battling with everything else on the cover to no good effect.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">C. Michael Lorion</font> submitted <strong>Totem (Book 1: Scars)</strong> designed by Glendon Haddix at Streetlight Graphics. &#8220;This is the third cover I&#8217;ve done for Totem, the first one done professionally. I gave Glendon the themes of a quaint New England city, a blizzard, 1978, Native American teenagers, American teenagers, time travel.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Totem.jpg" alt="Totem (Book 1: Scars)" title="Totem (Book 1: Scars)" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Creepy and exciting, a strong cover.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Cathy Perkins</font> submitted <strong>Cypher</strong> designed by Naomi Raine. &#8220;Unwilling to stand by while her family and world are destroyed, Cara Wainwright rips apart the secrets surrounding Cypher, the company her father built—and will take any measures to defend. I asked Naomi to focus on Cara, her determination and the company.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Cypher.jpg" alt="Cypher" title="Cypher" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>The girl is strong, not sure about the building, it looks a bit like apartments in Los Angeles to me.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Christina Westcott</font> submitted <strong>A Hero for the Empire</strong> designed by Kanaxa. &#8220;I was so happy the cat made it on the cover. He plays an important role in the book; sort of a cross between Garfield and Chewbacca.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/A-Hero-for-the-Empire.jpg" alt="A Hero for the Empire" title="A Hero for the Empire" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Charming featured character, and the cat is cute but I think I would have toned down the background to focus more attention on the main figure.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Christopher Gray</font> submitted <strong>RAKER</strong> designed by Tom Edwards. &#8220;RAKER is a short story that takes place in the same universe as my novel DARK NIGHTS. This time the story focuses on an advanced android named Plato rather than on the human characters. I worked with designer Tom Edwards to fashion an anthropomorphic character with implied battlefield capabilities.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/RAKER.jpg" alt="RAKER" title="RAKER" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>The character came out great, the type looks a bit oversimplified in comparison.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Cindy Blackburn</font> submitted <strong>Unbelievable</strong> designed by Karen Phillips. &#8220;Hi Joel, This is the cover to my new cozy mystery, Unbelievable, which was released on Amazon in early November. The mystery is set in a rural lakeside town in Vermont and those dogs do feature prominently in the plot. I&#8217;m interested to learn what you think! Thanks, Cindy Blackburn&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Unbelievable.jpg" alt="Unbelievable" title="Unbelievable" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I&#8217;m not too familiar with the &#8220;cozy mystery&#8221; genre so it&#8217;s difficult to say if this is what readers will be looking for. There&#8217;s not much here that says &#8220;mystery&#8221; to me and the title is very weak.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Colleen Mooney</font> submitted <strong>Rescued By A Kiss</strong> designed by Cover to Cover Designs. &#8220;The cover depicts the scene where the protagonist kisses a stranger in a New Orleans Mardi Gras parade and how entangled their lives become from an innocent kiss in exchange for a flower.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Rescued-By-A-Kiss.jpg" alt="Rescued By A Kiss" title="Rescued By A Kiss" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>It&#8217;s not very effective because the busy background is right behind the point where we should be focusing: the kiss. The cute type can&#8217;t help and the dog seems like another distraction.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Curtis Edmonds</font> submitted <strong>Wreathed</strong> designed by Dangerdust. &#8220;This is an entry for the November contest. Thanks.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Wreathed.jpg" alt="Wreathed" title="Wreathed" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>See my comment above about big swathes of black, but here it works much better, and I love the way the title is integrated with the art.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Damon Za</font> submitted <strong>Naomi</strong> designed by Momir from Damonza.com.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Naomi.jpg" alt="Naomi" title="Naomi" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Here the designer takes firm control, rendering a cover with simplicity to focus our attention but plenty of subtle detail in texture and the &#8220;reflection&#8221; motif to keep us interested.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Damon Za</font> submitted <strong>Purity</strong> designed by Momir from Damonza.com.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Purity.jpg" alt="Purity" title="Purity" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A nicely captured and composed moment, but I&#8217;m not sure I see the reason for the grungy title.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Dane Low</font> submitted <strong>Bound By A Dragon</strong> designed by Dane &amp; Brittany at EbookLaunch.com.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Bound-By-A-Dragon.jpg" alt="Bound By A Dragon" title="Bound By A Dragon" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Gorgeous detail and careful typography create a classic look, with a subtle but effective series brand.<font color="gold"><font size="+1"> &#9733; </font></font></p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Dane Low</font> submitted <strong>Motive</strong> designed by Dane &amp; Brittany at EbookLaunch.com.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Motive.jpg" alt="Motive" title="Motive" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Hot and exciting. I want to read it right now.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Dane Low</font> submitted <strong>Pier View</strong> designed by Dane &amp; Brittany at EbookLaunch.com.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Pier-View.jpg" alt="Pier View" title="Pier View" width="200" /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Dane Low</font> submitted <strong>The Copy</strong> designed by Dane &amp; Brittany at EbookLaunch.com.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-Copy.jpg" alt="The Copy" title="The Copy" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A hint of spookiness and terrific composition make this cover stand out.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Dane Low</font> submitted <strong>Win Some Lose Some</strong> designed by Dane &amp; Brittany at EbookLaunch.com.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Win-Some-Lose-Some.jpg" alt="Win Some Lose Some" title="Win Some Lose Some" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Great visual storytelling for a tough title to work with. On the other hand, with the alternating type colors in the title the red wash takes time to make sense of, and that&#8217;s not usually a good result.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">David Jacob Knight</font> submitted <strong>The Phone Company</strong> designed by David Jacob Knight. &#8220;I integrated the typography into the environment of this stock image to create the illusion of depth. The warm colors invite readers to pick up the book, while the landscape piques the mind: What&#8217;s back there in those smoky depths? The imagery also reflects some of the themes of the book.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-Phone-Company.jpg" alt="The Phone Company" title="The Phone Company" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Oddly enough, everything else on the cover works better than the title. A simpler treatment might have better highlighted the story.</p>

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Kind of adorable, really, although the girl&#8217;s face could be more prominent.</p>

<p><font color="darkred">Diane Escalera</font> submitted <strong>Latin Heat Trilogy</strong> designed by Gilded Heart Design. &#8220;Latin Heat Trilogy features all three stories in the collection together for the first time in one sizzling edition.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I really like how different this design is, but not the way the noise in the background makes the title so hard to read.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Elisabeth Grace Foley</font> submitted <strong>Corral Nocturne: A Novella</strong><br />
designed by Jennifer Quinlan. &#8220;&#8221;Corral Nocturne&#8221; is a short Western retelling of the Cinderella story. I was delighted with the way Jenny Quinlan brought to life my idea for something that would fit the setting and yet have a bit of a fairytale flavor too (the tumbledown fence references the title and a key scene in the story).&#8221;<br />

<p><font color="darkred">Elise Stone</font> submitted <strong>Shadow of Death</strong> designed by Karen Phillips. &#8220;Shadow of Death is the second in my Community of Faith mystery series. Cover designed by Karen Phillips with another fabulous photo by Ed Mullins.&#8221;<br />

<p><font color="darkred">Elizabeth McCoy</font> submitted <strong>Crucible</strong> designed by Elizabeth McCoy; art by Sarah Cloutier. &#8220;I&#8217;m not entirely happy with the title&#8217;s size; my spouse insisted there should be more space at the edges, while I pointed out hardcovers with narrower title margins. Author-name font is for the fantasy-romance series; title font for this book&#8217;s low romance content (like a prior same-world short).&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Crucible.jpg" alt="Crucible" title="Crucible" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>It&#8217;s not easy to learn typography. The fonts and treatments and overall integration with the cover don&#8217;t make much sense, although the artwork could make an exciting cover.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Ella Medler</font> submitted <strong>Trial Run</strong> designed by Patti Roberts, of Paradox Book Cover Designs. &#8220;All the books in this collection convey the same happy-in-love feeling through their story lines, and the aim of the covers was to reinforce the belief that love conquers all. I wanted to leave the reader with a warm, happy feeling, and I think Patti&#8217;s covers achieve just that.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>It&#8217;s not apparent whether all the stars and swirls add to the effect or subtract from it, but it risks distracting us from the human interaction at the center of the work.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Erica Rimlinger</font> submitted <strong>The Truth About Suzie</strong> designed by Kevin Rimlinger. &#8220;My novel tells the story of friendship, honesty, and breast cancer as seen through—and obscured by—the lens of social media. I wanted a simple cover that evoked Facebook with an enigmatic profile picture of the titular character. The photo was cropped and pixelated to convey the mystery of Suzie.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A clean design with some mystery from the tightly cropped avatar, but a professional would have kerned the title (tucked the &#8220;r&#8221; under the &#8220;T&#8221; in &#8220;Truth&#8221;) and added another element to the bare visuals.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Farina de Waard</font> submitted <strong>Das Vermächtnis der Wölfe &#8211; Zähmung</strong> designed by Darko Tomic and Farina de Waard. &#8220;German ebook &#8211; &#8220;Das Vermächtnis der Wölfe&#8221; translates into &#8220;The legacy of the wolves&#8221; and is the title of the series, &#8220;Zähmung&#8221; is the title of the first book and will be named &#8220;Dedication&#8221; as soon as it is translated.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A creative and interesting visual although some of the type is starting to disappear into the background.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Gordon A. Long</font> submitted <strong>Out of Mischief</strong> designed by Gordon A. Long and Dusty Hagerud. &#8220;I know you don&#8217;t like fine detail pictures, but I hope that the title and the look on the girl&#8217;s face will attract a click, on Amazon, for example. Once the larger cover image comes up, the details of the setting are quite visible.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Au contraire! I love detail and texture and anything that adds to the overall effect. What I take objection to is gratuitous or distracting elements, perfectly exemplified by the odd rule passing right through the title.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">H.J. Bradley</font> submitted <strong>Prince in Exile Book One</strong> designed by Gabrielle Prendergast. &#8220;This is a design of the MC in this book.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Attractive and appealing. Some of the type is well done although the various type elements jump around quite a bit.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Ivan Kendrick</font> submitted <strong>Dream Date</strong> designed by Ivan Kendrick. &#8220;I wanted an appealing cover art that fit the book&#8217;s genre, romance. The heroine (a fashion model) is front and center. I altered her eye color to match her looks in the novel, and made adjustments to make the title art (a key element) more visible.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Despite your hard work the cover lacks interest and attraction for me.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">J C Warren</font> submitted <strong>Cryptic Cribs</strong> designed by Self Designed. &#8220;This cover is for Cryptic Cribs, a novel about a haunted reality TV show. The model is Katrinna Wallace and the photograph was taken by Terrence Drysdale&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Cryptic-Cribs.jpg" alt="Cryptic Cribs" title="Cryptic Cribs" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Nicely done, although I&#8217;d like to see these submitted with a soft border to keep the right edge from bleeding onto the background, as it does here, and the title, while well designed, seems to have been pushed almost to insignificance.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">J. Alexander Greenwood</font> submitted <strong>Pilate&#8217;s Blood</strong> designed by Scarlett Rugers. &#8220;This is the fourth book in my series, and the first time I worked with Scarlett Rugers. Previously I worked with an artist who had no experience in book covers. The covers were artistically valid, but probably didn&#8217;t do much to help me market my books. I think the Rugers direction is more effective.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Good decision, as the designer has used some powerful elements to create an exciting and interesting cover that will pull readers into the book.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">J.B. Simmons</font> submitted <strong>Unbound</strong> designed by Kerry Ellis. &#8220;The result of a fantastic 99designs competition. Thanks!&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Visually interesting, but that tiny red type (can&#8217;t see it huh? I had to enlarge this cover to see it myself) is just lost.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">J.Q. Davis</font> submitted <strong>Turning Grace</strong> designed by J.Q. Davis. &#8220;Grace is turning into something she never thought existed in real life&#8230;a zombie. The cover design was created to show that the transformation is happening in a subtle, but inevitable progression. She is still partly human, but the condition is taking over.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Turning-Grace.jpg" alt="Turning Grace" title="Turning Grace" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Yeah, but no. The photo isn&#8217;t bad, but the cover fails to communicate anything other than &#8220;self-published.&#8221; Hire one of the great professionals whose covers you see here and give them the photo to work with.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jake D. Parent</font> submitted <strong>Only the Devil Tells the Truth</strong> designed by Michael Bunnell. &#8220;Michael is an old friend of mine. He read portions of the book I thought stood out as capturing the ethos I was going for. In the end, I think he really captured the journey and possibilities the book draws its power from.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Wow, there&#8217;s so much texture, art, and story in this cover it demands a longer look. That&#8217;s a good thing, and the overall tone of menace and beauty is hard to beat.<font color="gold"><font size="+1"> &#9733; </font></font></p>

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Fantastic attention to detail in a cover that strongly focuses our view on the central medallion, with it&#8217;s intimations of story. Would have like to see the type stand out a bit more at this size.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jamie Rhodes</font> submitted <strong>Dead Men&#8217;s Teeth</strong> designed by Christa Leask.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Dead-Mens-Teeth.jpg" alt="Dead Men's Teeth" title="Dead Men's Teeth" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Strong design that shows how much you can communicate with simple elements.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jason Post</font> submitted <strong>Songbird</strong> designed by Jason Post. &#8220;The cover was to convey history and the music of WWII. The world map blended with the sheet music from the book lent well. The full print cover features the world map wrapped all the way around to the back cover. The bird itself was inspired by a tattoo I had seen somewhere and fit the book perfect.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Songbird.jpg" alt="Songbird" title="Songbird" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>An interesting and attractive cover that tells a lot with economy. Although I don&#8217;t see any specific connection with the 1940s, it&#8217;s still lovely.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jaxon Reed</font> submitted <strong>Redwood: Servant of the State</strong> designed by bespokebookcovers.com. &#8220;The cover focuses on main elements in the book, highlighting the eponymous giant trees, the cubic city in the distance with futuristic flying objects, and overall the alien simian eyes central to the action.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Redwood-Servant-of-the-State.jpg" alt="Redwood: Servant of the State" title="Redwood: Servant of the State" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>The sense of menace is powerful, makes you want to know how all these things connect.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jean Gill</font> submitted <strong>One Sixth of a Gill</strong> designed by Jean Gill. &#8220;I used my own photos: close-up black lace material for background texture. The girl reading was solarised to give the shiny, fantasy effect. The casual insertion of author first name avoids using Gill twice and fits the personal tone of the contents. Colours and fonts hint at crime and darkness&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/One-Sixth-of-a-Gill.jpg" alt="One Sixth of a Gill" title="One Sixth of a Gill" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Doesn&#8217;t work for me. The visual is confusing, the type is weak, and the device of inserting (&#8220;^&#8221;) the author&#8217;s name into the title simply adds to the confusion.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jeffrey Anderson</font> submitted <strong>Little God Blues</strong> designed by Phillip Gessert. &#8220;Since Little God Blues is a mystery with a rock music theme we wanted to create something visually bold, with an intriguing storyline while giving themes of guitar and mystery. Since it is a first novel we also wanted it to stand out visually in thumbnail format.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Little-God-Blues.jpg" alt="Little God Blues" title="Little God Blues" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Fits the bill, nicely done although the author&#8217;s name here doesn&#8217;t seem to match the overall mood of the rest of the cover. Small letterspaced caps like these are more commonly used on interior elements.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jennifer Tzivia MacLeod</font> submitted <strong>Captain Steve: A story of coming home</strong> designed by fiverr cover designer. &#8220;This is a children&#8217;s story about immigration to Israel after WWII, so I figured the cover would be a challenge. All images in the book are based on photos from the period, and the artist did a good job converting these to kid-friendly illustrations. I think the cover highlights her work nicely.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Captain-Steve.jpg" alt="Captain Steve: A story of coming home" title="Captain Steve: A story of coming home" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>But the designer had a name, didn&#8217;t s/he? I&#8217;d like submitters to credit the designer by name. Here a good concept, not so well executed. The visual in the center should be more prominent and the subtitle, sadly, is way off center.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jennifer Tzivia MacLeod</font> submitted <strong>No Santa!</strong> designed by self. &#8220;I like the simplicity of this for my first middle grade chapter book, about a kid whose Jewish family decides not to celebrate Xmas anymore. It&#8217;s basically two stock images, with text added. I think it&#8217;s fun and non-threatening and hints at the central conflict for the protagonist. (Hope I&#8217;m right!)&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/No-Santa.jpg" alt="No Santa!" title="No Santa!" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Very effective for this audience; needs a border around it.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jessica Baverstock</font> submitted <strong>The Letterbox</strong> designed by Jessica Baverstock. &#8220;This is the first e-book cover I&#8217;ve ever made for publication. The story is women&#8217;s fiction set in the Australian summer so I went for green and gold. I look forward to learning from your feedback.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-Letterbox.jpg" alt="The Letterbox" title="The Letterbox" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A nice effort. Try to find a way to make the three elements here—title, author&#8217;s name, visual—actually relate to each other somehow. They are quite disjointed.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jewel Allen</font> submitted <strong>Ghost Moon Night</strong> designed by Mikey Brooks.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Ghost-Moon-Night.jpg" alt="Ghost Moon Night" title="Ghost Moon Night" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A pretty cool and atmospheric design that feels cramped due to most of the content being confined to the top half. Tweaking the composition to get a better balance would pay off.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">John Bowen</font> submitted <strong>Vessel</strong> designed by John Bowen.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Vessel.jpg" alt="Vessel" title="Vessel" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>An interesting approach for a thriller, whose covers usually run much hotter, and it&#8217;s challenging to figure out the imagery in the central object. However, it&#8217;s still an intriguing and effective cover based on the strong composition and creative type treatment.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jordan Rivet</font> submitted <strong>Seabound</strong> designed by James at GoOnWrite.com. &#8220;I liked this designer&#8217;s pre-made covers, especially for science fiction and apocalyptic fiction. I asked for a custom cover using this evocative stock photo of a stormy sea and a big, bold font like the ones on his other covers. I love the way he branded my name and series title!&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Seabound.jpg" alt="Seabound" title="Seabound" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>So, you&#8217;re &#8220;riveted&#8221; by his design? Firmly attached to that foreboding piece of art? Electrified by the image?</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Josa Young</font> submitted <strong>Sail Upon the Land</strong> designed by Alison Eddy. &#8220;The cover illustration is by the British artist Lawrence Mynott. The central image of the girl&#8217;s head in silhouette is highly graphic and designed to be striking even as a thumbnail. The cover design is by Alison Eddy, who enhanced the drawing with a bold choice of typography and a touch of pink.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Strong illustration, idiosyncratic typography and a controlled palette help this cover stand out from the crowd.</p>

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>This is an attractive cover but one that gives no hint about the circus and its fantastical creatures that lie at the center of the story.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Josh Hayes</font> submitted <strong>Second Star: Breaking Through</strong> designed by Josh Hayes. &#8220;Designed this cover myself for my first book.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A good first effort somewhat confused by the many shapes, colors, and elements in the very active illustration that tend to blur the focus.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">KA Sterritt</font> submitted <strong>The Holly Project</strong> designed by Scarlett Rugers Design. &#8220;My book is a contemporary romance where the main female character is an architect and the main male character is a property developer.&#8221;<br />

<p><font color="darkred">Katy Haye</font> submitted <strong>The Last Gatekeeper</strong> designed by JD Smith Design. &#8220;I have loved every cover by JD Smith that I&#8217;ve yet seen and I&#8217;ve had lots of compliments on it from potential readers. I&#8217;d be interested to hear what you think about it as an example of the YA fantasy genre.&#8221;<br />

<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Kevin Wayne Williams</font> submitted <strong>Everything I Know About Zombies, I Learned in Kindergarten</strong> designed by Kevin Wayne Williams. &#8220;A horror novel about a fourth-grader and twelve kindergarteners was hard to design a cover for, as everything kept coming out cute. This was my final pass: a crumpled paper marked with the hand of a dying child.&#8221;<br />

The author wanted this dichotomy reflected in the cover. You are taking a 2nd look at the infamous bible story, and taking a 2nd look at the cover—instead of mountains &amp; water, you see a partial image of a woman&#8217;s shoulder &amp; hair.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Skill went into this cover and it answers the design challenge, but if you didn&#8217;t tell us about the woman&#8217;s shoulder and hair, would we have &#8220;gotten&#8221; it? And submitters, if at all possible please submit covers without award seals or badges on them so we can evaluate the cover itself, thanks.</p>

<p><font color="darkred">Lee Dunning</font> submitted <strong>Exile&#8217;s Redemption</strong> designed by Lee Dunning. &#8220;First in my heroic fantasy series.

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>The ready availability of type effects like emboss/deboss, drop shadows, texture mapping, and all the rest doesn&#8217;t mean we have to use them, and many designs could be improved by concentrating more on balancing and integrating the type into the overall design. Here, the title is disappearing a bit into the background.</p>

<p><font color="darkred">Liz Crowe</font> submitted <strong>Good Faith</strong> designed by Mina Carter. &#8220;For the final novel of my family saga/romance Stewart Realty series I asked the designer to help me reflect the challenges faced by the characters including mature marriages, teens with addictions, crumbling &amp; rebuilt friendships &amp; other &#8220;real life&#8221; issues.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A highly effective cover highlighted by the designer&#8217;s use of the image and type elements to focus us directly on the telling detail, in this case the glass.</p>

<p><font color="darkred">Liz Marshall</font> submitted <strong>Seeing Eye &#8211; A day at the fair</strong> designed by Elizabeth Marshall. &#8220;A mystery about a reluctant psychic. She&#8217;s at the Arizona State Fair, posing as a cheesy fortune-teller, and now she gets dragged into a murder investigation. The cover design came from the imagination of Liz Marshall, but it was brilliantly executed by Josh Kampmeier.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A creepy image combined with poor font choice and a seeming lack of understanding of how to use type don&#8217;t add up to much.</p>

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Moves the needle on the &#8220;creepy&#8221; scale nicely, and the understated design works to its advantage since there&#8217;s nothing to distract from the main point.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Madeline Wynn</font> submitted <strong>DAUGHTER OF THE FALLEN</strong> designed by Creative Paramita. &#8220;The book has a mystical feel to it, a girl becoming part of a previously great unknown, and the cover just captured that feeling perfectly.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Looks like the designer had quite a battle to try to make the type legible and tame the very active background, and only partially succeeded.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Maer Wilson</font> submitted <strong>Relics</strong> designed by M Joseph Murphy. &#8220;We wanted a cross-genre cover that would appeal to Urban Fantasy and Sci Fi fans. M Joseph Murphy delivered a concept where we see behind the curtain to find many worlds when magic returns to Earth.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>It&#8217;s almost like you can read the design brief: &#8220;Must have a football and a soccer ball on the same field&#8221; &#8220;Oh, and a high heel shoe.&#8221; &#8220;And a bra.&#8221; What does it all add up to?</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Marty Safir</font> submitted <strong>Field Anomaly</strong> designed by Marty Safir. &#8220;In the future, intrusive government surveillance has become the norm. The design reflects how people appear as stars on the surveillance monitors, and how some register as explosively bright anomalies. When viewed close, the anomalies are a torus shape, represented by the &#8220;O&#8221; in the title.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>High impact design that uses confident type handling to put all of our attention on the emblematic image of the heart.

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Something of a 50s-60s throwback style but a better font might have helped.</p>

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>There&#8217;s a lot of skill on display here in both the illustration and typography, despite a slightly confusing raven shape that frames the woman&#8217;s face.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Peter Clothier</font> submitted <strong>The Pilgrim&#8217;s Staff</strong> designed by Amy Inouye/Gregg Chadwick. &#8220;The novel has two narrators: an 18th century English rake, and a 21st century figure painter. This is reflected in the dual aspect of the book&#8217;s cover, the artist&#8217;s studio and a painting that riffs on 18th century erotic art.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Probably started as an interesting concept but ended up with so much visual confusion that it&#8217;s rendered ineffective as a book cover.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Peter J Story</font> submitted <strong>Things Grak Hates</strong> designed by Marie Story. &#8220;The goal with this design was to evoke thoughts of &#8220;primitive,&#8221; &#8220;bloody,&#8221; and &#8220;dark.&#8221;&#8221;<br />

<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Rachel Cole</font> submitted <strong>Escaping the Tiger</strong> designed by Littera Designs. &#8220;The original hardcover design was quite dark and not particularly eye-catching. The author wanted a design that featured soccer&#8211;something many kids could relate to&#8211;but still had an element of danger to it.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Well, I guess that&#8217;s a win. Not sure why the 2 word title needs 2 separate font weights.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Rasana Atreya</font> submitted <strong>28 Years A Bachelor</strong> designed by Manoj Vijayan from Inkbug Design. &#8220;I wanted a whimsical cover which also matched the styles of my previous books. Manoj Vijayan of Inkbug Design nailed it. The cover of The Temple Is Not My Father, which merited a gold star from you, was also designed by Manoj.&#8221;<br />

<p><font color="darkred">Renee Barratt</font> submitted <strong>Muses to Sustain the Thoughtful Life</strong> designed by Renee Barratt, The Cover Counts. &#8220;The author wanted something peaceful and inviting that allowed the reader to join him for a bit of self reflection in nature.&#8221;<br />

<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Robert McGee</font> submitted <strong>Justifiable Homicide: A Political Thriller</strong> designed by Roy Migabon. &#8220;The ebook addresses the question of when killing political leaders constitutes justifiable homicide. The cover includes a photo of the Capitol building in Washington as seen through the cross hairs of a high-powered rifle scope.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A strong cover. The tree relates to a famous Jefferson quote that&#8217;s superimposed on it and too small to read at this size, and comes very close to visually overweighting the cover.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Sandra Ulbrich Almazan</font> submitted <strong>Seasons&#8217; Beginnings</strong> designed by Book Cover Diva. &#8220;Maria Zannini of Book Cover Diva designed this cover. I completed a questionnaire about the book, and we discussed it further over e-mail. I did ask her to make my main character&#8217;s clothes white, but other than that, there were minimal changes.&#8221;<br />

<p><font color="darkred">Scott Rezer</font> submitted <strong>Shadow of the Mountain: A Novel of the Flood</strong> designed by Tamian Wood ~ Beyond Design International. &#8220;For this cover, Tamian Wood transformed the two main words in the title into images (Mountain and Flood) to create this simple, yet vivid cover.

<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Stacy Wray</font> submitted <strong>The Girl from the Kitchen Store</strong> designed by Scarlett Rugers Design. &#8220;This is my first book and I loved working with Scarlett.

<p><font color="darkred">Stephen Bryant</font> submitted <strong>Savage</strong> designed by Stephen Bryant. &#8220;For Savage, we wanted an ominous amusement park/dock. I am a big fan of horror being about the unknown, subtlety and tonality and hoped to capture an abandoned and old carnival dock appearance. For the type, I wanted to tie into the abandoned carousel vibe with a slight askew carnival type.&#8221;<br />

<p><font color="darkred">Storm Grant</font> submitted <strong>Shift Happens</strong> designed by Willsin Rowe, Coverage Designs. &#8220;Readers tend to expect male/male books to be erotic romance. SHIFT HAPPENS is a paranormal action adventure. To address this, we used illustration rather than photos. The author name and rainbow bar are used across all my books to indicate GBLT themes and my branding.&#8221;<br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Fantastic illustration style for an ebook cover, I&#8217;d love to see more like this one. I can understand the rainbow is important to your branding, but it&#8217;s on the border of intrusive.<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Contrary to many of the covers we see over the months, this one has clever and interesting typography but the image simply can&#8217;t hold up its end of the bargain.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Valerie Comer</font> submitted <strong>Sweetened with Honey</strong> designed by Hanna Sandvig at Book Cover Bakery. &#8220;Hanna Sandvig of Book Cover Bakery is the illustrator of my Farm Fresh Romance series, of which this is Book 3. This cover is in keeping with the previous novels and attracts a lot of attention.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I&#8217;m sure your readers will instantly recognize the distinctive illustration style, which takes center stage here.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Waheed Rabbani</font> submitted <strong>Doctor Margaret&#8217;s Sea Chest</strong> designed by Lin Shih, Stonepatch Design. &#8220;Book I of a series covering India&#8217;s freedom from the British Raj. Doctor Margaret&#8217;s sea chest, containing her diaries, is discovered in a hospital in Delhi. Margaret, born in New Jersey, marries her Canadian cousin. They serve in the 1854 Crimean war, before Margaret continues her journey to India.&#8221;<br />

<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>The many visual elements contribute to a lack of focus, especially since the woman is remote.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Wayne Elsner</font> submitted <strong>Tannion</strong> designed by Wayne Elsner. &#8220;The cover was designed by SelfPubBookCovers.com/Shardel. Thanks Wayne&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Tannion.jpg" alt="Tannion" title="Tannion" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Pardon me, but I think &#8220;designed&#8221; isn&#8217;t the right word here.</p>
<h3>Nonfiction Covers</h3>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Bill Jones</font> submitted <strong>I Was Thinking the Other Day About&#8230;</strong> designed by Elise Warnock. &#8220;Elise developed the idea for the cover, digitized my handwriting for the title graphic, and took the photo of my &#8220;stuff&#8221; to include in the cover photo. (Bill Jones, Author)&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/I-Was-Thinking-the-Other-Day-About.jpg" alt="I Was Thinking the Other Day About..." title="I Was Thinking the Other Day About..." width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Nicely done and so in tune with the topic.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Issy Flamel</font> submitted <strong>Ancient Wisdom for Modern Problems</strong> designed by Issy Flamel and Jimmy Gibbs at Fiverr.com.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Ancient-Wisdom-for-Modern-Problems.jpg" alt="Ancient Wisdom for Modern Problems" title="Ancient Wisdom for Modern Problems" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Shows the strengths of good type handling and composition, but the juxtaposition of the two eras and illustration styles is a bit jarring. (Has a different title on it in the Kindle store.)</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jacky Donovan</font> submitted <strong>Simon Ships Out: A heroic cat at sea</strong> designed by Dana Rizki Nur Adnan. &#8220;The idea for the cover was envisaged by author Jacky Donovan and executed by Dana Rizki Nur Adnan.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Simon-Ships-Out.jpg" alt="Simon Ships Out: A heroic cat at sea" title="Simon Ships Out: A heroic cat at sea" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Although I like the layout, and I&#8217;m a sucker for dogs (and cats!) on book covers, the combination of a photo imposed on top of a loose illustration really doesn&#8217;t work and detracts from the cover.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Janet Roberts</font> submitted <strong>The Power of Distant Healing</strong> designed by Mary Jo Stresky. &#8220;Mary Jo and I had many discussions about this cover, and eventually decided a rainbow was the best idea.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-Power-of-Distant-Healing.jpg" alt="The Power of Distant Healing" title="The Power of Distant Healing" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Rainbow or not, this is a very familiar look to covers done by non-designers grappling with how to integrate the various elements and then giving up.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Janna Graber</font> submitted <strong>Chance Encounters: Travel Tales from Around the World</strong> designed by Sanja Spajic. &#8220;I wanted to evoke the sense of place that is a key component in each of the stories in Chance Encounters: Travel Tales from Around the World. The stories focus on how those we meet while traveling can change our experiences or even our lives. The design includes two people who will cross paths.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Chance-Encounters.jpg" alt="Chance Encounters: Travel Tales from Around the World" title="Chance Encounters: Travel Tales from Around the World" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Communicates its subject well in a classy and atmospheric style, if a bit staid.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jennifer Tzivia MacLeod</font> submitted <strong>Now You Know: Chanukah for Kids</strong> designed by self. &#8220;Two simple elements combined using GIMP. Because most of my writing is fiction, I wanted the nonfiction / educational aspect of the book to really &#8220;pop&#8221; &#8211; hence the stylized speech bubble.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Now-You-Know.jpg" alt="Now You Know: Chanukah for Kids" title="Now You Know: Chanukah for Kids" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Could be instantly improved by simplifying the background image and making the bubble smaller and less obtrusive.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jennifer Tzivia MacLeod</font> submitted <strong>Now You Know: Israel for Kids</strong> designed by self. &#8220;Two simple elements combined using GIMP. Because most of my writing is fiction, I wanted the nonfiction / educational aspect of the book to really &#8220;pop&#8221; &#8211; hence the stylized speech bubble.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Now-You-Know-Israel-for-Kids.jpg" alt="Now You Know: Israel for Kids" title="Now You Know: Israel for Kids" width="200" /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Jill b.</font> submitted <strong>How to Keep Backyard Chickens &#8211; A Straightforward Beginner&#8217;s Guide</strong> designed by David Marsz.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/How-to-Keep-Backyard-Chickens.jpg" alt="How to Keep Backyard Chickens - A Straightforward Beginner's Guide" title="How to Keep Backyard Chickens - A Straightforward Beginner's Guide" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Awesomely cute chick you&#8217;ve got there. And a design that works on every level.<font color="gold"><font size="+1"> &#9733; </font></font></p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">John Blain</font> submitted <strong>Four Easy Steps</strong> designed by John and Emilia Blain. &#8220;A simple clean design to reflect the quirky and light hearted approach that this book takes to the serious business of losing weight for the long term. The front cover cartoon, drawn by Emilia Blain, is one of many used throughout the book to highlight the challenges of dieting.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Four-Easy-Steps.jpg" alt="Four Easy Steps" title="Four Easy Steps" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Despite the care that went into this, I think you can see by comparing to the other covers here that it just doesn&#8217;t work due to the very small and disappearing visual and typographic elements.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">John Doppler</font> submitted <strong>Drowning a County</strong> designed by John Doppler. &#8220;Drowning a County is an exposé of the Virginia Department of Transportation&#8217;s neglect of rural drainage systems. The goal was to create a simple, arresting image that works with the title to evoke the catastrophic consequences of that inaction.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Drowning-a-County.jpg" alt="Drowning a County" title="Drowning a County" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Nicely displays the subject matter of the book in a controlled way, although the title might have been a bit more stylish.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Judy Lair</font> submitted <strong>From the Other Side of the Couch</strong> designed by Judy Lair. &#8220;Photography and cover art by Tabitha Stone. I wanted the cover to draw readers into the intimacy of my counseling office with the afghan from my aunt that sits on my couch. The colors entice the eye and the organic craft work brings a sense of warmth and comfort, important counseling qualities.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/From-the-Other-Side-of-the-Couch.jpg" alt="From the Other Side of the Couch" title="From the Other Side of the Couch" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A good idea, and this cover is carefully put together, but I can&#8217;t help feeling the image has been allowed to push aside the title/subtitle where the actual information is conveyed.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Kashonia Carnegie</font> submitted <strong>Brainwashed: A True Story of Psychological Domestic Violence</strong> designed by Chris Bull and Alex Pazeto–fiverr.com/alerrandre. &#8220;The lead designer shredded the author&#8217;s head-shot for the cover, to indicate the shredded mental state of the author as a result of being psychologically abused.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Brainwashed.jpg" alt="Brainwashed: A True Story of Psychological Domestic Violence" title="Brainwashed: A True Story of Psychological Domestic Violence" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>The shredded image and the color scheme all work together, but I&#8217;m mystified by the type size and odd color changes, and that&#8217;s distracting.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Kay Tuckton</font> submitted <strong>Yellowed Pages &#8211; torn from a travel journal</strong> designed by K G Tuckton. &#8220;The background is a royalty-free image of an old sheet of paper; the photo is mine, cropped and given a sepia treatment. To fit the feel of years gone by: a traditional font for title and author: a convincing handwritten font (Galeforce) for the sub-title. No risk of being taken for a guide-book.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Yellowed-Pages.jpg" alt="Yellowed Pages - torn from a travel journal" title="Yellowed Pages - torn from a travel journal" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>A good idea, but the end result really lacks excitement, drama, or interest. Where&#8217;s the hook?</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Kevin Parham</font> submitted <strong>The Vineyard We Knew—A Recollection of Summers on Martha&#8217;s Vineyard</strong> designed by George Foster. &#8220;The cover design for &#8220;The Vineyard We Knew—A Recollection of Summers on Martha&#8217;s Vineyard&#8221; reflects the nostalgic story of a time gone by. What we&#8217;ve attempted to capture through the design is a feeling of a simpler time in life (1950s &amp; 60s), all within the context of a humble existence.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-Vineyard-We-Knew.jpg" alt="The Vineyard We Knew—A Recollection of Summers on Martha's Vineyard" title="The Vineyard We Knew—A Recollection of Summers on Martha's Vineyard" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>What I really like about this cover is the way the designer leads us from the intimacy of the top photo, through the masterful typography in the center, down to the bottom photo with the subtitle. Makes you want to read the book to find out more.<font color="gold"><font size="+1"> &#9733; </font></font></p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Laura Roberts</font> submitted <strong>Confessions of a 3-Day Novelist: How to Write an Entire Book in Just 72 Hours</strong> designed by Bojan at PixelStudio. &#8220;This is the first in a planned series of &#8220;Indie Confession&#8221; books (the second will be on editing, and the third on publishing), so ideally the two other books will use a similar color scheme and fonts to help with branding &#8212; so long as this cover meets with the Book Designer&#8217;s approval, of course!&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Confessions-of-a-3-Day-Novelist.jpg" alt="Confessions of a 3-Day Novelist: How to Write an Entire Book in Just 72 Hours" title="Confessions of a 3-Day Novelist: How to Write an Entire Book in Just 72 Hours" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>I think it&#8217;s great, but needs more contrast because the whole thing is sinking into monochrome. The place for that contrast is in the title treatment, the weakest element of this cover.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Lori Schafer</font> submitted <strong>On Hearing of My Mother&#8217;s Death Six Years After It Happened: A Daughter&#8217;s Memoir of Mental Illness</strong> designed by Lori Schafer. &#8220;I originally hired a designer to create this book cover. We agreed on a stark, simple design &amp; on the base image-but I hated her result! It was clunky and totally unprofessional-I would have been embarrassed to use it. I was so upset that I thought I could do a better job myself, so I gave it a try.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/On-Hearing-of-My-Mothers-Death-Six-Years-After-It-Happened.jpg" alt="On Hearing of My Mother's Death Six Years After It Happened: A Daughter's Memoir of Mental Illness" title="On Hearing of My Mother's Death Six Years After It Happened: A Daughter's Memoir of Mental Illness" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Good job, a visually expressive design for a poignant subject.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">N. J. Lindquist</font> submitted <strong>A Taste of Hot Apple Cider</strong> designed by N. J. Lindquist. &#8220;Clarification on the category. This book is an anthology. While the majority of the content is nonfiction (true personal stories), there are also three poems and one short story (fiction.)&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/A-Taste-of-Hot-Apple-Cider.jpg" alt="A Taste of Hot Apple Cider" title="A Taste of Hot Apple Cider" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Just love it, from the happy orange color to the delightful apple and alluring title.<font color="gold"><font size="+1"> &#9733; </font></font></p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Rebecca Bielawski</font> submitted <strong>Bees Like Flowers</strong> designed by Rebecca Bielawski.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Bees-Like-Flowers.jpg" alt="Bees Like Flowers" title="Bees Like Flowers" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Charming and perfectly aimed at young children.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Renee Davis</font> submitted <strong>Become the Best You</strong> designed by Helen Braid.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Become-the-Best-You.jpg" alt="Become the Best You" title="Become the Best You" width="200" /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Robert McMechan</font> submitted <strong>Allison&#8217;s Brain</strong> designed by Jennifer Ettinger.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Allisons-Brain.jpg" alt="Allison's Brain" title="Allison's Brain" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Nicely composed illustration but the poor treatment of the title throws the whole thing out of whack.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Rosa Raskin</font> submitted <strong>Mentoring Power</strong> designed by Rosa S. Raskin. &#8220;The cover is a photograph of one of the authors sharing a book with her great-niece, first thing in the morning, before they both dressed for the day&#8217;s activities. We can find mentors close to us or in formal programs, in this case a senior, age 65, is shown with a toddler, age 22 months.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Mentoring-Power.jpg" alt="Mentoring Power" title="Mentoring Power" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>An ebook cover that only a mother could love. Overcome artlessness by hiring one of the great designers whose work you see on some of the covers in this article.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Ruby Romera</font> submitted <strong>First Orgasm</strong> designed by Ruby Romera. &#8220;I found your awards invaluable when finalising my cover design. I knew I wanted it simple and striking and thought that for this topic, just the few colours worked best. Thanks for your website, it&#8217;s awesome&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/First-Orgasm.jpg" alt="First Orgasm" title="First Orgasm" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Well, thank <I>you</I> Ruby. I wish I could say the same about your cover. Considering how juicy this subject is, I&#8217;d love to see something that better reflects the human quality of your subject.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Sandra Chambers</font> submitted <strong>Lord, It&#8217;s Boring in My Prayer Closet (How to Revitalize Your Prayer Life)</strong> designed by Myself&#8211;Sandra Chambers. &#8220;I did the cover photo myself and used a filter in Photoshop to make it look a little more edgy. I looked at several covers available to purchase for my book, but nothing fit my title, so I decided to try it myself. Voila!&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lord-Its-Boring-in-My-Prayer-Closet.jpg" alt="Lord, It's Boring in My Prayer Closet (How to Revitalize Your Prayer Life)" title="Lord, It's Boring in My Prayer Closet (How to Revitalize Your Prayer Life)" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>Despite an appropriate stock photo, the lack of understanding how covers come together and how to work with type is very apparent.</p>
<hr />
<p><font color="darkred">Tim Riordan</font> submitted <strong>Immovable: Standing Firm in the Last Days</strong> designed by Jenn Riggs. &#8220;My book is about Bible prophecy for the last days. Much of it relates to spiritual armor of Eph. 6. You will notice the letters or the title are made out of a knight&#8217;s mail.&#8221;<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Immovable.jpg" alt="Immovable: Standing Firm in the Last Days" title="Immovable: Standing Firm in the Last Days" width="200" /></a><br />
<strong><font color="crimson">JF:</font> </strong>No, actually I wouldn&#8217;t have known it was chain mail without you telling me, it just looks like a distracting texture that makes the title even harder to read than it already is. The photo is terrific, I just think you&#8217;ve overworked it, and it would be much more powerful without the extraneous detail and challenging layout.</p>

</p><p>With snowstorms and flooding, it&#8217;s been quite a week, hasn&#8217;t it? While we can&#8217;t rely on the weather, we can depend on a steady supply of great articles on writing and self-publishing. I&#8217;ve picked out some of the best from this week to share with you. Hope you find them interesting!</p>

&#8220;Facebook has more than 1 billion users worldwide, and it ranks as the No. 1 site (or No. 2, depending on whom you ask) in the United States. For this reason alone, it’s often one of the first topics of conversation when discussing an online marketing plan or author platform. Should it be?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Anne R. Allen</strong> on Anne R. Allen&#8217;s Blog &#8230;with Ruth Harris<br />

&#8220;Not everyone will like your book. And sometimes, you may end up with a one-star review. I’ve been there, and initially it feels like a punch in the gut. So what’s the best way to deal with a negative review? Respond? Ignore? Take the feedback into consideration?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Simone Collins</strong> on Live Write Thrive<br />

&#8220;One of the best ways aspiring authors can develop successful writing careers is to listen to and apply advice from successful authors.

&#8220;Two years ago I posted a set of New Year’s resolutions for writers, which was well enough received that I posted another set of resolutions the following December. This holiday season, since I’m all about tradition (as opposed to being all about that bass), I’ve assembled several more resolutions for writers to consider as the new year approaches.&#8221;</p>

</p><p>By <a href="http://twitter.com/caballofrances" target="_blank">Frances Caballo</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor.</em><br />
—Truman Capote</p>
<p>Who likes to fail?</p>
<p>No one, right?</p>
<p>I don’t even like the synonyms for failure: tanked, bust, crashed, burned.</p>
<p>They make it sound as though you can’t redeem yourself. As though along with failing, that failure itself signifies a finality to your endeavor.</p>
<p>The opposite is true. Failure always brings us to new beginnings.</p>
<p>That “new beginning” stuff sounds like a platitude and when we’re depressed about our defeat.</p>
<p>But it’s more than a platitude. It’s the truth.</p>
<p>I was fired once over a philosophical belief. It’s a long story (it always is). The short story is that I held a certain belief that my board of directors didn’t endorse.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I was without a job.</p>
<p>I went through the usual turmoil of anger and resentment. To friends I said, “How could they?” “You won’t believe what they said!” “They can’t be serious.”</p>
<p>Well, they were serious.</p>
<p>So I painted some rooms and thought about my future. During those months, I decided to launch my own business and here I am today.</p>
<p>I’m happier now than if I had continued in that job. And that’s the truth too.</p>
<h3>How to Rise from Failure</h3>
<p>So how does this blog post apply to you? Good question. Failure comes in different shades and degrees and applies to different layers of life.</p>
<p><strong>Failure as an Author</strong></p>
<p>Do you ever feel as though you’re failing as an author? Take these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign up for a writer’s conference.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Hire the best developmental editor you can afford.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Take workshops to help you develop your craft.</li>
<p></p>
<li>If you write nonfiction, hire a book coach.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Sign up for webinars and teleseminars on craft.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Write another book.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Try a different genre.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Write some poetry.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Read great authors, you know, the masters: Faulkner, Woolf, Hemingway, Chekov.</li>
<p>
</ol>
<p><strong>Failure as a Marketer</strong></p>
<p>Let’s face it; if you’re an Indie writer, you’re also a marketer. If you want your books to sell, you’ve got to put some energy into building your platform.</p>
<p>Authors new to marketing worry about mistakes. Here’s the truth: we’ve all made them, and they can all be corrected or at least ameliorated.</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you select the wrong Twitter handle? That’s easily taken care of. Just log into your twitter account and change it. Then remember to change it everywhere else, such as your blog, website, email signature, business cards, etc.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Would you like to start over with your Facebook page? Unless you have a thousand or more page Likes, delete it and start over.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Is your book priced too high? Log into CreateSpace, KDP or IngramSpark and lower the price.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Did you send a tweet you wished you hadn’t? Follow these directions:
<ol type="a">
<li>Visit your Profile page.</li>
<li>Locate the Tweet you want to delete.</li>
<li>Click the More or ellipsis icon ( ••• ).</li>
<li>Click Delete Tweet.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<p></p>
<li>You can remove items from your Facebook Timeline, but that won’t negate the fact that they’re already in your fans’ and friends’ news feeds. To get rid of status updates from your Timeline:
<ol type="a">
<li>Hover over the post on your Page’s Timeline.</li>
<li>Click the arrow in the top-right corner of your post.</li>
<li>Select Hide from Page or Delete Photo, which will delete the entire post and image.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<p></p>
<li>Do you want to start all over with Twitter? Cancel your current account and start anew.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Are you beating yourself up because you didn’t send a press release when you launched your book? Write one and send it today.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Do you wish you had chosen a different domain name or chosen another WordPress theme? Hire a web developer, select a new theme, buy a new domain and transfer the content.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Have you been promoting your books too frequently on social media? Stop. Adopt the 80/20 rule: 80 percent of the time post quotes, images and content from other writers and 20 percent of the time promote your stuff.</li>
<p>
<span id="more-34866"></span></p>
<li>Do you hate your profile image? Ask a friend to spend some time with you taking new shots, and then use PicMonkey.com to edit the image.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Join a LinkedIn or Facebook group or a Google+ Community to learn more and develop your marketing skills.</li>
<p></p>
</ol>
<h3>How to Avoid Social Media Gaffes</h3>
<p>There’s only one way to prevent a serious gaffe on social media. Self-reflect before you self-reveal. Ask yourself if what you’re about to post would be something you wouldn’t want your employer, rabbi or pastor to see.</p>
<p>If you make other errors, they can almost always be corrected to some degree.</p>
<p>Just try not to worry about errors. Venture out onto the social web, create some profiles, read blogs and try to improve your skills over time.</p>
<p>Remember, others will be far more forgiving of the errors you make than you will. So cut yourself some slack, experiment with your content, and have fun.</p>
