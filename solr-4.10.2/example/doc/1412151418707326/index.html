<p>Bill Kirton&#8217;s <em>The Darkness</em> charts the moral journey of a doctor who succumbs to fantasies of revenge. Dr. Andrew Davidson seeks justice for his brother, who commits suicide after his wife and daughter die in a car crash. He wants to punish not just the drunk driver who caused the accident, but other sociopaths who destroy lives and evade punishment. One by one, suspected criminals begin to disappear from the streets of Cairnburgh, Scotland.</p>
<p>Inspector Jack Carston, charged with investigating the disappearances, has mixed feelings. He isn&#8217;t sorry to have rapists, child molesters, and killers off the streets, but whoever has taken them is equally a criminal. He and his partner set about solving the cases in their quiet, methodical way.</p>
<p><em>The Darkness</em> pits a compelling antihero against a reticent hero. Both are intelligent and likable. Davidson is kind to his patients, considerate of his coworkers, and sweet to his girlfriend. Carston loves his wife and enjoys his work. But the doctor eclipses the inspector through most of the story.</p>
<p>The doctor becomes the dramatic center as soon as he appears, largely because of the narrative point of view. Most of the narrative is third-person omniscient, but the doctor addresses the reader in first-person, which is direct and intimate and places him at the emotional core of the story. Everything happens around him. Eventually we learn that we&#8217;re reading his confession, addressed to Carston. This device links the doctor to the detective and underscores their shared need to see justice done.</p>
<p>Once the investigation begins to break, Carston&#8217;s role becomes more active and his character takes center stage. Still, the doctor remains the heart of the story. What will he do with the captives in his basement? Will his sanity survive the trauma of the crimes he&#8217;s committed?</p>
<p>Kirton writes elegant prose and creates memorable characters. Even secondary players stand out. I won&#8217;t forget the prostitute Rhona or her devoted boyfriend, Billy, for a long time. <em>The Darkness</em> might confound some readers who expect every mystery novel to follow a conventional pattern, but those who enjoy intelligent psychological suspense are in for a treat.</p>

<p>This is an excellent children’s picture book for Christmas. The story is beautiful, written by Jay Dee in simple but elegant and evocative prose, and the illustrations by Darren Geers are beautiful, colourful without being garish and with a truly lovely light quality. The book has also been beautifully produced, nicely printed and well laid out.</p>
<p>The illustrations create a large part of the book’s charm. The artist has imbued the drawings of Elfie, the other elves and Santa Clause with a great deal of expression. They beam off the page.</p>
<p>But the story itself does something wonderful; it merges the story of Santa Clause with the birth of Jesus, and also makes a clear statement on the kind of dedication required to achieve perfection. Santa Clause and his role as gift bringer to the good, and Christmas as the story of Jesus Christ’s birth can easily seem like two unrelated ideas of Christmas, but this story shows that it doesn’t have to be like that.</p>
<p>I love this story so much that I will read it to my family on Christmas day—and my child is twenty one!</p>
<p>I give this book 5 stars, and nominate it for an AIA Seal of Excellence as an excellent example of a children’s picture book.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/worlds-within-worlds-review-long-overdue/"><img width="890" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB-890x400.jpg" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="Worlds_Final-WEB" /></a><p><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-10620 aligncenter" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Worlds_Final-WEB-198x300.jpg" alt="Worlds_Final-WEB" width="198" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I received a free copy of Tahlia Newland’s Prunella Smith: Worlds within Worlds for review, and I have to say up front – this is a book that is long overdue. It addresses cyber bullying, especially as it pertains to writers and reviewers, but does so in a chilling way that will live you looking over your shoulder with every word you write.</p>
<p>Prunella Smith is a freelance editor and author who is up against a deadline on an editing job – a fantasy story about an adventurous woman, Kelee, who is having an affair with a young groomsman on her estate. Ella, as she is known, is also a book reviewer, and a recent review of a not-so-good novel has provoked the author, Dita, to begin a campaign of on-line stalking and bullying. Dita’s cyber bullying begins to take its toll, interfering with Ella’s ability to objectively edit Kelee’s story, and things only get worse when she discovers that she has a physical stalker as well.</p>
<p>Newland’s tale kept me interested from page one – and the little surprise she threw in near the end, well -2 I didn’t see that one coming. A thoroughly entertaining story. An easy five stars here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/waverton-good-read-award-big-in-the-village/"><img width="890" height="400" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/the-ghosts-of-eden-sharp-890x400.jpg" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="the-ghosts-of-eden-sharp" /></a><p>In 2004 the novelist Tony Saint lamented that he was not even the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3619863/Im-not-even-the-fifth-best-novelist-in-Waverton.html">fifth best novelist</a> in the village of Waverton after his first novel had failed to reach the shortlist for the annual <a href="http://www.wavertongoodread.org.uk/winners.html">Waverton Good Read Award</a>.</p>
<p>Never heard of the WGRA? You are not alone. A little history, then. A family doctor in a village in France decided it might give his patients something to think about beyond their ailments if he got them all reading and voting on the latest novels. So Le Prix De La Cadière d’Azure was born and although the prize is now discontinued it inspired enterprising people in the village of Waverton (pop. 2000) in Cheshire, UK, to do the same.</p>
<p>Publishers are invited to send debut novels by British authors to be read by dozens of villagers who create a long list, then a short list and then – voila – the winner. It’s one of the few literary prizes run by readers and is now in its twelth year. Previous winners have included Mark Haddon for <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em> and Maria Lewycka for <em>A History of Tractors in Ukrainian</em>. There are also one or two winning authors that you’ve never heard of like … ahem … myself, for <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ghosts-Eden-Andrew-JH-Sharp-ebook/dp/B0055HM3EO/ref=sr_1_1_twi_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417611657&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+ghosts+of+eden">The Ghosts of Eden</a>. The Waverton win came and went but then came calamity: my publisher ceased trading and my literary agent changed career.</p>
<p><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/the-ghosts-of-eden-sharp.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1029" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/the-ghosts-of-eden-sharp-300x300.jpg" alt="the-ghosts-of-eden-sharp" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Despite the collapse of my marketing support, I was delighted that out there, beyond the baying and smog of the city, the steady readers of rural England had liked my novel. In the villages of my home patch it was all bouquets and elderflower champagne. Deep in the rural county of Rutland, in mink-and-manure Manton, the villagers filled the village hall for my author talk and in Kibworth in Leicestershire the effervescent owner of the Kibworth Bookshop corralled locals into the pub for a book group evening over gin and beer. In tiny Arnesby, where thatch is as rampant as roses, I fielded questions that good family folk really want to know from an author, such as what his mother thinks of the swearing in his novel. In book groups in Knighton, a village long ago swallowed up by Leicester, we drank glass after glass of wine until we’d all forgotten why we were sitting there with a novel in our laps. In Woodhouse Eves, retirement village for philosophers it seemed … I was probably out of my depth. Nevertheless, I was flattered and grateful for those evenings with readers.</p>
<p>They say that the British comedian Norman Wisdom was big in Albania when he was unknown elsewhere and I like to fantasise that I was big in the village once.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="featured_image_link" href="http://awesomeindies.net/aia-what-does-it-mean/"><img width="300" height="295" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/aia_low-res_sm-300x295.jpg" class="aligncenter wp-post-image" alt="aia_low-res_sm-300x295" /></a><h1><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/aia_low-res_sm-300x295.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10332 aligncenter" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/aia_low-res_sm-300x295.jpg" alt="aia_low-res_sm-300x295" width="300" height="295" /></a></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Awesome Indies Books (#AIbk) is an independent book publishers’ and self–publishers’ accreditation, review and book listing site. The books listed on this website have passed a <a href="http://awesomeindies.net/for-authors/submissions/">stringent review process</a> and have been Awesome Indies approved (AIA) by our <a href="http://awesomeindies.net/about/approved-reviewers/">highly qualified reviewers</a> as being the same, or of a higher, standard of craftsmanship as a mainstream published book. Our books <em>are</em> the <em>awesome</em> indie books. Only roughly 40% of books submitted to us for accreditation meet our clearly laid out criteria. Another 10% meet the criteria after revising their books to some degree; usually this involves another proofread and very often a line edit.</p>
<p>Even books where their authors say they have been ‘professionally edited’ do not always meet the criteria because the reviewers look at all levels of editing. It’s isn’t a matter of having no typos; AI approval requires a high level of editing at all levels—developmental/structural editing, line editing, copyediting and proofreading. Although the reviewers try to review submissions as objectively as possible—like a tutor marking an assignment or a publisher looking for their next book—where it isn’t clear which side of the accreditation line a certain book lies, subjectivity does, of course, enter in to some degree. At this point you could say that we have a &#8216;house style&#8217;, one that favors books that hold attention and have a strong voice and good craftsmanship. We like books that fall outside of the box, but only if they&#8217;re well executed.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Awesome Indies only one opinion was required, but that allowed too much subjectivity and variation depending on which reviewer reviewed the book. Now AI approval requires at least two—and often three—opinions from <a href="http://awesomeindies.net/about/approved-reviewers/">qualified reviewers</a>, so any new additions to the Awesome Indies Books website are guaranteed to be excellent examples of a well-crafted book.</p>
<p><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/bookstore/intelligent-design-revelations-j-m-erickson/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-10538 size-medium" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IntelligentDesign-AMAZON-187x300.jpg" alt="IntelligentDesign-AMAZON" width="187" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>But why does the Awesome Indies accreditation badge have the extra A on it, as in AIA? AIA means Awesome Indies Approved. There is an organisation called the American Institute of Architects who use that anagram, and when it has &#8216;Editing&#8217; or &#8216;Publishing&#8217; after it, as in <a title="AIA Editing Services" href="http://awesomeindies.net/for-authors/full-editing-services/" target="_blank">AIA Editing</a> and <a title="AIA Publishing" href="http://awesomeindies.net/publishers/aia-publishing/" target="_blank">AIA Publishing</a>, it means Awesome Independent Authors, but when you see it in a gold or silver circle on a book cover or on an author’s website, it’s the Awesome Indies Badge of Approval. It has nothing to do with architects. If it’s a pure gold symbol, not the one with black lettering, it is the Awesome Indies Seal of Excellence.</p>
<p><a href="http://awesomeindies.net/bookstore/lethal-inheritance/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-10645 size-medium" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/DPS-LI-web_Seal-199x300.jpg" alt="DPS-LI-web_Seal" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://awesomeindies.net/about/the-seal-of-excellence/">AIA Seal of Excellence</a> is awarded to books where one of our reviewers thinks the book is outstanding enough to nominate it for a Seal, a second reviewer has agreed, and a sample has been checked by a senior editor. Only books that excite our reviewers get a Seal of Excellence. To see these books select <a href="http://awesomeindies.net/product-category/seal-of-excellence-recipients/">Seal of Excellence Recipients</a> from the Book Categories drop down box.</p>
<p>So that’s it in a nutshell. Any questions?</p>

<td>Tom&#8217;s about average height, but he&#8217;s built like a muscle-bound bull. He&#8217;s got dirty-blond hair that tends to stick up a bit, bright blue-green eyes that are often narrowed in either amusement or anger, a straight, noble-looking nose (despite the fact that he&#8217;s broken it at least once as far as he can remember), and full lips that are smiling more often than not. He tends to eschew shirts, so he&#8217;s tanned to a deep honey from working outdoors aboard the pirate ship. The thing that is alarming about Tom is that he is covered in scars; the knife scar that runs through one sandy blond eyebrow, the crisscrossed white lines on his knuckles, and the layers upon layers of healed whip marks on his broad back are all evidence of a dark and disturbing past.<a href="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Tom-bluenight-large-1024x948.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10673 size-medium" src="http://awesomeindies.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Tom-bluenight-large-1024x948-300x277.jpg" alt="Tom-bluenight-large-1024x948" width="300" height="277" /></a></p>

<p>Jane Davis has the insight and sensitivity of a great writer; with a little more refinement, she could be a great writer. This story is about a school teacher accidentally stabbed as he tried to break up a fight at school. As he recovers in hospital, he remembers his childhood and the people who left him. People always leave him, and that’s why he avoids a relationship with a female colleague, the second on the scene of the accident and the one who visits him regularly in hospital because he doesn’t really have anyone else—except a student in need that he has reached out to.</p>
<p>The story has several themes. One is the downside of the rules of disclosure and child protection laws when a teacher comes across instances of abuse in a child’s family, and the limitations put on a teachers’ ability to help when a student needs help beyond what can be given within the school’s walls. Another is the affect a missing person has on those that care for the person, and the third is the challenges faced by those living ‘on the wrong side of the tracks’, particularly in relationship to negotiating the gangs.</p>
<p>Davis is skilled at creating real, complex characters that we can relate to and quickly care about. Their circumstances draw out our empathy and increase our understanding of a lifestyle that is probably foreign to most readers. The plot revolves around the suggestion that the two teachers may get together, the question of whether he will live or die and what will happen to the neglected boy with the candid opinions and insightful perception of his two teacher’s lives. As in real life, things do not run smoothly or tie up neatly, and yet the book comes to a satisfying conclusion that is neither soppy nor depressing.</p>
<p>This is a book to which I would love to award 5 stars, but this is not possible due to some formatting issues (blank lines between every paragraph), the occasional clumsy prose constructions and several instances of poor grammar that, though not noticed by your average reader, would not pass an editor in a major publishing house—and this is the benchmark that the Awesome Indies measures against in awarding 4 stars. I have pointed out these issues to the author and I believe that the formatting will be fixed.</p>

<p>In Prunella Smith: Worlds Within Worlds, Australian writer Tahlia Newland addresses the timely problem of authors harassing, stalking, and even physically attacking reviewers who have panned their books. But this novel isn&#8217;t a lurid melodrama. It&#8217;s a contemplative story about the creative process that&#8217;s also, amazingly, a page-turner. I put everything else aside and read it in a single afternoon.</p>
<p>Editor and author Ella Smith lives with her cat in an isolated area of the Australian bush. She has one or two close friends and goes on an occasional date, but most of the time she&#8217;s alone. That&#8217;s how she likes it. Then she begins receiving email threats from &#8220;Dita,&#8221; an irate author whose book she reviewed. She has no idea who Dita is. He uses pseudonyms online and writes under a pen name.</p>
<p>Her response is to retreat into the inner worlds that nourish her creativity. A serious Buddhist, she meditates to overcome the fear and anger triggered by Dita&#8217;s threats. She doesn&#8217;t have time for them; a deadline is approaching for a major editorial project. Besides, what can he actually do to hurt her? She soon discovers that even in the abstract world of the Internet, Dita can inflict damage to her reputation and livelihood. He highjacks her Facebook account and bad-mouths her in online forums. Her book receives a spate of one-star reviews. Editorial work dries up. The threats in his emails escalate. It become harder and harder for her to retreat to a place of safety.</p>
<p>The novel contains long passages from the fantasy novel that Ella is editing, and I become caught up in that story, just as she does. When the fantasy&#8217;s plot takes a wrong turn and she tries to persuade the author to rewrite, Newland reveals that characters from the fantasy also appear in her Lethal Inheritance series and their fate depends on Ella&#8217;s being able to change the fictional author&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the metafictional aspect of Worlds Within Worlds. Newland includes a foreword emphasizing that she is NOT Ella. She doesn&#8217;t need to explain, at least not to me.</p>
<p>The novel has some weaknesses. Long passages describe the process of meditation. I found them interesting (although a bit didactic at times), but some readers may feel they slow the story. The plot culminates in a revelation that I figure out very early, but Newland covers her foreshadowing enough to make me wonder if I&#8217;m wrong.</p>
<p>Writers will appreciate Worlds Within Worlds for its exploration of the creative process. Intelligent readers will enjoy the memorable characters, the suspense, and the intricacies of Ella&#8217;s interlocking worlds.</p>

<p><em>Off the Beaten Track</em> is a memoir of long time travel writer Frank Kusy, author of the AIA Seal of Excellence winner <em>Rupee Millionaire</em>. Kusy’s experience as a writer shows in the fluid, vibrant prose he uses to describe his travels in Asia in the seventies. This is an engaging story full of anecdotes that have you smiling and shaking your head at the antics of the young Kusy.</p>
<p>The difficulty in memoir writing is to find a thread that unifies the story in the way that the plot does in fiction. Generally, real life isn’t as dramatic as fiction, and in unskilled hands, it’s easy to lose a reader if the account of a person’s life wanders aimlessly. This would be particularly easy to do in a travel memoir, but Kusy has worked skilfully with his material and used the thread of his efforts to both secure and avoid getting a wife in the same way that a fiction writer would use a plot. Though the various anecdotes are interesting in themselves, without this emphasis, they would not provide such a satisfying whole. We want to read to the end to see how young Frank’s bumbling efforts at romance turn out. Frank is an endearing character and his perspective on the world and efforts to live as a Buddhist add another layer of interest to the memoir.</p>
<p>The other theme, as the title suggests, is his desire to get off the beaten track, and the events that thwart his attempts to really experience Asia without a whiff of tourists provide further interest beyond a mere account of his travels. Though not as dramatic as Rupee Millionaires, it’s still a great read, especially for anyone interested in travel in Asia. Highly recommended.</p>
<p>The editing is excellent. My only misgiving was that I would have liked the author to have gone more deeply into some aspects of his journey; for example, the ceremony when the Joju Gohonzon was enshrined in the main temple in Jakarta. No doubt the author has his reasons for staying clear of it, but I felt it was a missed opportunity to go deeper into the culture.</p>
<p>All up Kusy is a very talented memoir writer and this book should be enjoyed by a wide variety of people.</p>
