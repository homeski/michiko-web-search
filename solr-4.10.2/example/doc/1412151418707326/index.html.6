				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="triberr_endorsement"></div><p id="stcpDiv"><span style="color: #003366;">Hi everyone! Because it is crazy town in Angela&#8217;s house as she tries to keep up with deadlines and prep for Christmas, she&#8217;s giving a past <a href="http://seekerville.blogspot.ca/2014/01/10-reasons-our-hero-need-flaws.html">Seekerville</a> post some new love. Please read on to better understand why compelling Heroes (and Heroines!) MUST have flaws!</span></p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/hulk-fists.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-11546 size-medium" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/hulk-fists-300x225.jpg" alt="hulk fists" width="300" height="225" /></a>When we see the word <b>Hero</b>, we think heroic, which is ironic because our protagonists are usually anything but at the start of a story. Instead they are often jaded, lost or incomplete in some way, toting along a collection of flaws and false beliefs about the world and themselves. But that’s okay, because characters that fascinate readers most are layered, complex, and most of all, human. Brainstorming flaws can be difficult—which faults to choose, how many to give them and why, but here are ten reasons why all heroes need them.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">1) TO CREATE REALISM AND EMPATHY:</span></strong></p>
<p>In real life, people have faults-no one is perfect. It stands to reason that for a character to be believable, he also must be flawed. Readers are people too, ones who are as prone to poor choices, mistakes, and overreactions due to their shortcomings as our hero is. When they see the fallout created by a character’s faults,  they empathize, knowing just how it feels to screw up. And as the character learns more about himself and works toward overcoming his flaws to reach his goals, the reader will cheer him on because the desire to achieve self-growth is universal.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">2) TO UNDERSTAND BACKSTORY:</span></strong></p>
<p>To write a compelling character, it isn’t enough to slap a few attributes and flaws into their personality and then throw them at the story. Fascinating characters come about by understanding who they are at their core. If you know a character’s flaws, you can brainstorm their past to better understand what experiences made these negative traits form. Backstory is valuable to know (for you as the author, not to dump into the story) because it helps you plot out what motivates them, how they will behave (their choices, mannerisms, pet peeves, etc.), and what they avoid to keep from being emotionally hurt. Knowing these details means you’ll be able to write them authentically, making them real to readers. (If you would like help brainstorming your character’s past, I recommend trying the <a href="http://writershelpingwriters.net/writing-tools/">Reverse Backstory Tool</a>.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;"> 3) TO CAUSE RELATIONSHIP FRICTION: </span></strong></p>
<p>When everyone gets along, a story flat lines. Flaws act as sandpaper in a relationship, rubbing characters against one another to create delicious friction. A flaw vs. flaw (sloppiness pitted against a perfectionist) or a flaw vs. an attribute (inflexibility vs. free-spiritedness) both build tension and conflict which draws readers in, quickens the pace and raises personal &amp; relationship stakes. For more detail, here’s an article on <a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/01/04/clashing-personalities/">How to Create Friction In Relationships</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">4) TO CREATE CONFLICT: </span></strong></p>
<p>Flaws mean blind spots, biases, pet peeves and irrational emotional reactions to name a few. All of these things cause the hero to mess up along the way, creating conflict. A story road paved with mistakes, misjudgements and poor choices amp up tension at all levels, and make it even harder for the character to succeed. The antagonist can turn the hero’s mistakes to his own advantage, becoming an even greater threat.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">5) TO PROVIDE A BALANCE: </span></strong></p>
<p>If a hero has too many strengths (positive attributes), not only will he come across as unrealistic, it will be too easy for him to succeed. This makes the story predictable because as conflict pops up, there are no flaws to hamper the hero’s efforts or create setbacks, and he will always win. Readers want to see a hero struggle, because it makes the victories so much sweeter. Failure is also important to a character’s  arc: he must hit bottom before he can succeed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">6) TO REVEAL EMOTIONAL WOUNDS: </span></strong></p>
<p>Flaws bloom into being as a false protective measure when a person suffers an emotional wound. Why false? Because while they appear to “protect” a person from bad experiences (emotional pain), they actually hold back growth and damage relationships. Take a girl who grows up with parents who have high standards. They only bestow affection when she proves herself to be the best and so later in life, she equates anything less than perfection as failure. She may become a workaholic, inflexible, and overachieve, all to protect herself from feeling low self-worth at not measuring up (thanks for that, Mom and Dad!). Flaws are guideposts to these deep emotional wounds, something every author should know about their characters as it ties directly into Character Arc (see below).</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">7) TO GENERATE INNER CONFLICT: </span></strong></p>
<p>Inner conflict is the place where the characters faults (flaws) and negative thoughts (I’ll never be good enough, I’ll never find love, I’m not worthy, etc.) reside. Good story structure dictates that a protagonist’s flaws should be counterproductive to achieving his goal and that his negative thoughts should sabotage his self-worth. These things are what the hero must face about himself and change. Only through subduing his flaws will he have a chance at achieving his goal.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">8) TO BE A FORCE FOR CHANGE: </span></strong></p>
<p>Flaws get in the way at the worst times, pressuring the character to act. Let’s say our hero is determined to take control of his family’s struggling company, but he’s notoriously irresponsible. To keep the business afloat, he must apply himself. His desire to not disappoint the people counting on him force him to take a hard look inward at his own irresponsibility, which he must change to succeed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">9) TO ENCOURAGE SELF-GROWTH: </span></strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned before, one of the core needs of all people is to grow as a person. Growth is tied to happiness and fulfillment, so if your characters has flaws, small ones or big ones, showing him overcome them allows him to feel satisfied and happier, and will resonate with readers who are on their own journey of self-improvement.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">10) TO COMPLETE THE CHARACTER’S ARC: </span></strong></p>
<p>Flaws shouldn’t be random—each flaw forms from a negative past experience. In Character Arc, there should be at least one core flaw that stands in the character’s way (see inner conflict) of achieving his goal. For the character to win (his outer motivation) he must face his fears, deal with the emotional wounds of his past, and see that achieving his goal is more important that the risk of suffering another emotional wound. Only by subduing his core flaw and banishing his negative thoughts can he be free of fear. This necessary self-growth will help him find the strength needed to achieve his goal.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #800000;">What <a href="http://writershelpingwriters.net/negative-trait-thesaurus/">types of flaws</a> do you burden your character with? Is it a challenge for you to find a way for him to overcome these flaws?</span> </strong></h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="triberr_endorsement"></div><p>Today we&#8217;re taking a field trip to touch on something all writers struggle with at some point: story doubts. It might come about because of a less-than-enthusiastic reaction from a beta reader, or after requests for fulls go nowhere. Maybe you have rewritten your opening 9,000 times or have three drafts of your novel, all told from different points of view, and still feel uncertain which version is the right one.</p>
<p>Doubt &#8211; soul crushing worry that we are not capturing our story well enough &#8211; can not only snuff out a novel, but the writer&#8217;s spirit as well.</p>
<p><strong>Jennie Nash</strong> has some excellent insight into this pool of doubt, and how to swim through it to write deeply from passion, telling the story as only the author can.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Fleuron.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6244 aligncenter" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Fleuron-300x119.png" alt="Fleuron" width="300" height="119" /></a>I’m a book coach, and all day long I have writers coming to me who want to work out the Where and What and How of their story. Many of them are in the midst of some kind of writerly anguish: they have a pile of agent rejections, or they are 2/3 of the way through their 23rd draft and they’re still not sure the book is working, or they got to the last scene and suddenly realize that nothing has happened in the last 150 pages so there’s nothing to resolve. They are not sure how to move forward or even if they <em>should</em> move forward. They are, in other words, full of doubt, and somewhere along the line, they have come to believe that the way out of that doubt and that anguish is to focus like a laser beam on these <em>Where, What, How</em> questions:</p>
<h2><strong><em>Where should my story really start? What needs to happen in the middle? How is the best way for it to end? </em></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Agony-and-Defeat.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-11261 size-medium" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Agony-and-Defeat-200x300.jpg" alt="Agony and Defeat" width="200" height="300" /></a>Nine times out of ten, they are asking the wrong questions. Instead of Where, What, and How they should be asking <em>Why?</em> – and not even about the story itself, though that is an extremely powerful exercise, too*, but about <em>themselves as writers</em>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re anything like me and almost all the writers I work with, your story has been haunting you for quite some time. It keeps you up at night. It nags at you when you are reading other people&#8217;s stories. It pops into your head at times when it is least welcome.<strong><em> It wants to be told. </em></strong></p>
<p>It can be extremely useful to know <em>why</em> you think it&#8217;s haunting you. I actually believe that not knowing the answer to why is one of things that holds a lot of writers back. They know they like to write, they know they&#8217;re good at it, they know they have a story to tell, but they don&#8217;t know why it matters to them, or what, exactly, it means to them.</p>
<p>As a result, they write a book that doesn&#8217;t ever really get down to anything real and raw and authentic. They write pages that skate along the surface of things. And if there&#8217;s one thing readers don&#8217;t need, it&#8217;s to skate along the surface. That&#8217;s what the Internet is for. And cocktail parties. And the line at Costco.</p>
<p>Listen to <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action.html">Simon Sinek&#8217;s TED talk</a> on how great leaders inspire action. It&#8217;s 18 minutes long, but even if you listen to the first 6 minutes you&#8217;ll get it. The main point of the talk is this: &#8220;People buy things because of WHY you do them, not because of WHAT you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Writers want someone to buy something from us as much as the folks over at Apple and Nike. We do! Even before we talk about dollars and cents, we want readers to buy that we have something important or entertaining or illuminating to say. We want agents to buy that our idea is generous and alive.</p>
<p><strong>So all this work you&#8217;re going to do on WHAT your book will be?</strong> <strong>It often all hinges on WHY you want to write it</strong> — on why it is haunting you, on what captivated you from the start, on what the spark was, on why you care so much. If you can articulate that, it will probably unlock the story in very powerful ways.</p>
<p>In 2002, literary agent Ann Rittenberg gave a speech at Bennington College that sums this up beautifully.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>          <span style="color: #333399;">  </span></em><span style="color: #333399;">What kind of writer can make characters [you care about]? I think the kind of writer who is not afraid to access the deepest places in himself, and is not afraid to share what he comes up with… I see plenty of writing that has kernels of good in it, but it&#8217;s hedged around with so much tentativeness, or uncertainty, or excess, or stinginess, that it doesn&#8217;t allow the outsider — the reader — in… Yet when I read something that speaks to me, that absorbs me, that remains vividly in my head even when I&#8217;m not reading it, I&#8217;ve been intimate with the person who wrote it before I&#8217;ve even met him. This isn&#8217;t to say I know anything about him. I only know he or she&#8217;s the kind of writer who&#8217;s willing to explore the deep essence of character&#8230;.</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><em>That’s the kind of writer I am guessing you want to be. So how do you get there? Ask yourself the following:</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Try to recall the moment your story came into your head. What took root in that moment?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why does it matter to you? What does it mean to you? It wouldn’t have stuck in your head if it didn’t mean something and matter to you – a lot.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Have you been shying away from the truth of that moment – out of fear of how raw it is, or how powerful it is? Let yourself to get closer to it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Let that truth inform your story from beginning to end. Let it be the engine that drives your narrative forward. A story that has a single driving force tends to be a story that has a solid beginning, a gut-wrenching middle and a satisfying end.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>*Ask why of your characters, as well. Why do they care about what they care about? Why will it hurt them not to get it? Why are the afraid? Why can’t they do what they know they should? Why did they do what they just did? Why did they cry? Why, why, why. It can be the key to great writing.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="triberr_endorsement"></div><p><b>As writers, we want to make our characters as unique and interesting as possible. One way to do this is to give your character a special skill or talent that sets him apart from other people. This might be something small, like having a green thumb or being good with animals, to a larger and more competitive talent like stock car racing or being an award-winning film producer. </b><br />
<b><br />
</b><b>When choosing a talent or skill, think about the personality of your character, his range of experiences and who his role models might have been. Some talents might be genetically imparted while others are created through exposure (such as a character talented at fixing watches from growing up in his father’s watch shop) or grow out of interest (archery, wakeboarding, or magic). Don’t be afraid to be creative and make sure the skill or talent is something that works with the scope of the story. </b></p>

<p>Why do the best ideas come in the middle of the night, when we have nothing to write with, and getting up from the warmth of blankets is a Herculean task? Perhaps it is karma for all the bad things we do to our protagonists.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="triberr_endorsement"></div><p><span style="color: #ff6600;">I have a confession. *whispers* <em>I&#8217;ve never been interested in writing short stories.</em> I put so much planning and research into my writing that it always seemed like kind of a waste of time to write something so&#8230;short. But after hearing Ian Martyn&#8217;s arguments in favor of short story writing, I can absolutely see his point. As a matter of fact, I think I&#8217;m going to recommend his Inspiration Word exercise to my writing group&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In one of my blogs, I advocate blog writing as a tool for improving your writing, whatever your genre or subject. However, today I want to champion short story writing, and also the reading of short stories. I think too often these pieces are dismissed as less important than full-length novels—somehow frivolous or not worthy of our attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I’m a member of a writing group, and at the end of every session we are given a word. We can write whatever we want, and occasionally I have experimented with poetry, which for a fiction writer is always an interesting exercise. However, most of my efforts result in short stories. Some of the stories on my site come from those inspiration words: <em>Weather Vane, Dancing, Pickpocket, Watching</em>. I have numerous others, some of which I am trying to edit and submit to competitions and others that I will try to publish.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So as an author, why should you spend your precious time on short stories?</span></p>
<div id="attachment_11327" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aprillynn77/24111292/in/photolist-38zrX-8QKuz4-37Tp3m-8dh9tU-hjbY9-5BJrNp-dEK32f-9uekHs-cUxeGq-hKEF7R-4RevVU-4uyrcn-6xDeFF-38zrW-6aH1Sc-8p35CL-5Z241e-Zm3sr-5Gsigr-8mMA88-5BJkg9-5eYk97-6TpAdd-68rcQL-9pRzps-6Tpzr7-6TpzfC-at2T9V-rcZ-9WbE1c-cKNF5y-ciirrA-4Revkf-5GsiYt-4xBQtC-9vZFQW-5eYeK9-99jZ8m-3ftCGg-5GsmFz-nkvMH-2KEwfN-fBm85W-gHgSha-4jm9XZ-4zduiF-4zhJib-cCpLco-hPXoef-hrfk9G" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-11327 size-medium" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/24111292_3bdcd3d997_b-300x200.jpg" alt="24111292_3bdcd3d997_b" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">April Killingsworth @ Creative Commons</p></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They’re fun.</strong></span> I mean it, they are. In my writing group, we’re given a word and one week to produce the goods. (OK sometimes I get behind, but never mind). For me, the result turns out to be about 1500 words long; I think the reason for this is because with a piece of this length, there is enough room to explore a topic without distracting me too much from my other work. Anyway, after some wracking of brain cells I get the first inkling of an idea and then run with it. For a writer, that’s great. Enthusiasm for writing any story is usually greatest at the beginning. When writing shorter works, you get to feel that energy more often—energy that will often transfer to your other writing projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">2) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They provide the opportunity for quicker feedback.</strong></span> Because short stories don’t take as long to write, you’re able to share more often with writing groups or critiquers. This means you get feedback faster and can more quickly apply what you’ve learned during the process. If you’re not a member of a writing group, pass your short story around to friends and family and ask them for feedback. It’s a little easier than having them review something you’ve worked on for months. Also, non-writers will find a shorter piece less daunting to critique, and they’re more likely to be honest, especially if you tell them you’re ‘experimenting’.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">3) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They provide the chance to experiment</strong></span>. Short stories provide the opportunity for you to try out new ideas, writing styles, even different genres, to see if they work. It’s hard to do this with a novel, because you’re often too invested to feel comfortable experimenting. I’ve read science fiction short stories by a number of authors including Asimov and Alistair Reynolds, and I’m sure this was their goal (in part) when writing these successful pieces.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">4) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They provide more outlets for getting your work out there.</strong> </span>Earlier, I mentioned my intent to enter some of my short stories in competitions. I also intend to submit more to magazines. If you are inspired to write short stories or you have a few already gathering dust, why not do the same? What have you got to lose? If you’re successful, you’ve gotten your name out there. Even if you don’t succeed, you’ve gotten valuable experience polishing a piece for publication, and that’s good practice for when you’re revising your novels.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">5) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Reading short stories gets the wheels turning</strong></span>. Take time out from reading novels to try short stories. It’s a great way to sample different ideas and styles, learn, and get inspiration. In the ‘Inspiration’ section of my site I list Robert Silverberg’s ‘Science fiction 101’, in which he reviews some classic sci-fi short stories, explaining why he thinks they’re so good. For anyone writing short stories in this or any genre, I would recommend taking a look at these. Then pick out other writers’ shorts to check out. And don’t forget all the <a href="http://letswriteashortstory.com/literary-magazines/" target="_blank">short story magazines</a>; there are many out there in all genres</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So that’s five reasons why I think writing (and reading) the humble, often overlooked short story is such a good idea. Which makes me realise that I now need to go away and work on a few more for my site. Perhaps you’ll read then and make a comment.   If you have short stories on your site, let me know. I’ll try to have a look and comment in return.</span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #800000;">ORGANIZATION</span></h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Description</b></span>: The ability to discern what is needed for a particular project or event, and then to prepare and collect any people, resources or information into a state of readiness so that everything moves forward efficiently.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Beneficial Strengths or Abilities</b></span>: A good organizer can look at what must be done and immediately formulate a plan of action that is effective and insightful, taking into consideration any factors that might create challenges so that they can be prevented or minimized. Having foresight of what the path ahead may look like, being educated and familiar with common practices and factors that may cause friction regarding the project needing organization are both important. Punctuality, thoughtfulness, and being able to articulate oneself well will help one obtain resources, support and help as needed. A good organizer has strong time management skills, can split their attention to complete different action items, and is able to set aside their ego and be a team player. Projects might be small, day-to-day items requiring navigation, or larger events that involve many people, resources and high stakes.<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://writershelpingwriters.net/2010/10/character-traits-thesaurus-collection/">Character Traits</a><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;"> Suited for this Skill or Talent</span></span></b><span style="color: #000000;">: efficient, orderly, articulate, friendly, inspiring, tenacious, analytical, hard working, clever, imaginative, visionary, trustworthy<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Required Resources and Training</b></span>: A strong organizer usually has checklists and time management tools to keep both herself and others on task, ensuring all pieces of the project are in place each step of the way. Experience can also be gained by volunteering under the leadership of a mentor will expose them to the many different factors that goes into organizing a project or event. Understanding a particular subject, industry or set of circumstances will require investigation and/or experience. For example, a planner for a climbing expedition must understand mountaineering and the particulars of a specific climb to ensure the right gear is obtained. They also need to understand potential hazards such as weather, terrain, and local animal dangers in order to plan what might be needed in an emergency (first aid medicines and supplies, a mode of communication such as a satellite phone, etc.). They would have also need to investigate guides to find the right match for the climb, plan and buy supplies for hydration and nutrition that are tailored for climbers, stay within a pack weight ratio and manage a budget. Without first understanding what climbing is like and what factors into a climbing expedition, planning properly would be difficult and mistakes could put participants at risk.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Scenarios Where this Skill Might be Useful</b></span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Tactical organization, when one must plan a single attack, prepare for war or defend one&#8217;s home and resources</li>
<li>Planning an escape, when success depends on minimizing as much danger as possible</li>
<li>Preparing one&#8217;s resources for survival (understanding how many pounds of meat is needed to survive the winter, or being prepared to take advantage of opportunities such as collecting rainfall, harvesting grain or vegetables at an optimal time) and then storing it effectively</li>
<li>Managing money or resources</li>
<li>Climbing the ladder at one&#8217;s workplace and being a go-getter</li>
<li>Delegating jobs to people who one is in part responsible for, in order to give them hope when it is lost, make them feel valued or needed, or to collectively achieve a goal for the betterment of all</li>
<li>In a leadership role, or any position that one has authority and responsibility</li>

That statistic claiming that more people are afraid of public speaking than of anything else in the world. I mean, the everyday person would rather be trapped in a cave, touch a spider, or be chased by clowns than address a crowd. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">But in today&#8217;s market, visibility is huge. Somewhere between 600,000 and 1 million books were self-published last year IN THE US ALONE. For readers to know about our books, we&#8217;ve got to get out there and be seen. And that means book signings, school visits, library engagements, speaking at conferences, etc. If the mere thought makes you break out in hives, take a deep breath, because Rachel Amphlett is here to share 3 simple tips for surviving any public speaking event. IT CAN BE DONE, PEOPLE!</span></em></p>
<div id="attachment_11171" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ter-burg/5807870061/in/photolist-6A9jW1-7Z2cqT-g6qJeW-74nJta-762KYT-5pe4Ph-bUVsVh-766Fij-6FiSCR-fcE8fe-7d1Kcz-9RdRqH-psgDFg-9Rbkn8-9RebsL-9Reaid-9RebTW-7kadjF-9EWrFd-fcUr79-av1aCV-9Rejuu-cMkRJo-9j7nKd-51oerJ-9djzvy-9RebHS-766Dxy-9Reujp-7nsca2-6KkHqH-7faEfj-7nw7CQ-4W16E6-g6qnA2-fcUr8L-6FiSGD-51oeo9-9K9QSZ-766EhE-fAtnCr-766HRE-7aAHov-7oLzus-9aosJy-fcE8ba-cMkQ6y-754xeL-egtPjA-x5oBy"><img class="wp-image-11171 size-medium" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/5807870061_8c95c6ccbb_b-300x200.jpg" alt="Creative Company Conference 2011" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sebastiaan ter Burg @ Creative Commons</p></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Most writers I know, myself included, are quite happy in their own little worlds. We might venture out to go to work, socialize with friends, or do the shopping but we’re never happier than when we’re tucked away daydreaming or scribbling down frantic notes for our current works in progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The problem is, when we are required to do public speaking, we’re simply not equipped for it. In fact, we’re terrified. So, how do you go from happy introvert to confident extrovert, even if it’s just for a few minutes?</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">Prepare Yourself</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">You’re probably going to be asked to read an excerpt from your latest work. The trick here is to read it out aloud on your own a couple of times during the week leading up to the event.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Talking out loud is a lot different to talking in your head. You’ll spot the words you’re likely to trip over, you’ll discover a whole new meaning to ‘pacing’ and, more importantly, you’ll find the places where you can come up for air.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Yes, remember to breathe – please. We don’t want you passing out from lack of air.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">Know Your Audience</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The first public talk I ever did with regard to my writing was in a library, on a Saturday morning, to two people. Yes, two.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I was still scared. These lovely ladies had read about my first novel in the local paper and had decided that they’d better come along to see what I had to say for myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I quickly realised it would be ridiculous if I insisted on standing and pacing about in front of them, so instead we pulled up a little circle of chairs and I started off by explaining how I decided to write a book. Before I knew it, a whole hour had gone by, two of the library employees had joined us, and they’d all grabbed details of how to download my book (it was only available as an eBook at the time, and the library still supported me, thank goodness), and we’ve exchanged emails since that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Sitting down and being at the same level as my audience meant we were a lot more approachable to each other – the gesture broke down any ‘us and them’ barriers that might have otherwise been in place, and led to a much better engagement. And I realized that they weren’t so scary after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The key here is to size up your audience and adjust your presentation, if necessary. Are the guests talkative and chatty? Engage them with questions. Are people taking lots of notes? Slow down the tiniest bit to allow them time to write. Reading your audience is hugely helpful in allowing you to tailor your presentation to their needs, which can make for a more successful event.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">Take Your Time</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For the life of me, I can’t remember where I learnt this trick, but trust me – it works. Whatever the occasion, when it’s your turn to stand up in front of an audience, make them wait.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Not too long, though. By taking your time, I mean walk up to the podium, stage or whatever speaking platform has been set up, and either open the book and run your gaze over the first few sentences, or adjust the microphone. Adjusting the microphone is my favorite trick. Personally, I haven’t got an excuse, because at six foot tall I usually tower over my host anyway, but it’s a fantastic way to prepare for public speaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When I was asked to read an excerpt from my first book at an international thriller author’s book launch, I adjusted the microphone, looked up at the audience, and asked if they could hear me okay. A few people at the back called out that they could, and off I went. Those precious few seconds allowed me to:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">• Get my breathing under control</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> • Eyeball my audience</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> • Engage with my audience, and prepare them (and me!) for the sound of my voice</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Hopefully the above tips will help ease your nerves leading up to your moment in the spotlight. If public speaking is something you’d like to develop, there are several groups you can join, <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org" target="_blank">Toastmasters</a> being the obvious choice, and one I’ve participated in a couple of times. I found them to be incredibly supportive and attentive listeners and the feedback is invaluable. Often, the hurdle is getting used to your own voice, but once you’ve done that, you’ll be well on your way to being a confident public speaker, even if it’s just for a few minutes.</span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHITTLING</strong></h1>
<div id="attachment_11189" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tinytall/5068714787/in/photolist-odqBV7-edshcj-f2coEY-64Jdcf-eia1pm-azuRMo-3T31w-6CMNbr-5kSjB7-6B139u-azuRyL-eAY4eU-e6Xmn9-azuRHd-8HUujg-eAUWZc-pr2QG-fxhXQo-6QS8N1-aNKDuv-8Gsq6d-5thmC9-5thmCh-5m6XbW-yd3rK-yd3mj-7WFaA8-eia2km-6fXnJU-7Bj6bf-nsYSmP-5kQdnE-2Gajg-7WF9vK-6wn2x1-6bSnqx-7owz9j-7WJ2Jy-7WJnrb-9FK7CS-6bSkCK-6bWvRC-9vQXNs-7WFaTR-fW9sd-3wHrWj-dRerXi-fW9wM-9vMVdv-9vMUsB" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-11189 size-medium" src="http://cdn.writershelpingwriters.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/5068714787_2c685a966a_b-300x300.jpg" alt="5068714787_2c685a966a_b" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Andrea Parrish-Geyer @ Creative Commons</p></div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Description</b></span>: <span style="color: #000000;">To shape a piece of wood by chipping or cutting small pieces from it</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Beneficial Strengths or Abilities</b></span>: good hand-eye coordination, dexterity, a steady hand and firm grip, the ability to sit for long periods of time without getting stiff or sore</span></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://writershelpingwriters.net/2010/10/character-traits-thesaurus-collection/">Character Traits</a><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;"> Suited for this Skill or Talent</span></span></b><span style="color: #000000;">: imaginative, artistic, patient, calm, resourceful, meticulous, focused, obsessive</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Required Resources and Training</b></span>: Whittling is a time-consuming activity that takes much practice to master. It can be learned with little or no teaching; all you really need is a sharp knife, a piece of wood, and lots of time. It helps to have a basic understanding of wood types, so you can choose the type of wood that will yield the best result for the project. And while you can whittle with any knife, smaller ones work best, and different kinds of blades can help with different cuts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Associated Stereotypes and Perceptions</b></span>: The most common stereotype associated with whittling is the country bumpkin (usually male) sitting on the front porch whittling sticks down to toothpicks. While it makes sense that an avid whittler needs access to wood, he doesn&#8217;t have to live <em>in</em> the actual woods. Items can be whittled from wood chunks or twigs found in a park, or even from lumber bought at a hardware store.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Scenarios Where this Skill Might be Useful</b></span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">for relaxation or stress relief</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">as a way of passing the time when one has excess time on one&#8217;s hands</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">coming up with a new product or technique that can be turned into a much-needed money-making venture for the hero</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">when a small, secretive item is needed to help save the day (a lock pick, wooden coin, weapon, etc.)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">when it&#8217;s necessary to camouflage something important as an everyday object</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Stories Where Whittling is Used As Part of the Plot Line</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Shawshank Redemption—though Andy Dufresne whittled soapstone instead of wood</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Spindle&#8217;s End (Robin McKinley)</span></li>

<p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">So, I mentioned that November is insane, right? My son&#8217;s birthday falls just before Thanksgiving. This year, we&#8217;re throwing his first party. He wanted a Darth Vader theme, and I may have gone a teensy bit overboard. Regardless, his birthday party, combined with his actual birthday, followed by my father-in-law&#8217;s birthday, and then Thanksgiving for the family at MY HOUSE THIS YEAR&#8230; Well. Let&#8217;s just say that it&#8217;s all about planning and pacing right now. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Advice that is so often true of writing, too.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">And I just happen to have this nifty post on the subject, which originally aired at <a href="http://lisahallwilson.com" target="_blank">Lisa Hall-Wilson&#8217;s excellent blog</a>. So, in homage to the difficult topic of pacing, and in an effort to maintain my natural hair color through yet another November, here it is, for your viewing pleasure&#8230;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I’d like to start this post by stating an opinion that I think pretty much everyone shares: Pacing Sucks. When you get it right, no one really notices. I mean, how many times have you read a 5-star review that went on and on about <em>the awesome pacing</em>? On the other hand, when the pacing’s off, it’s obvious, but not always easy to pinpoint; you’re just left with this vague, ghostly feeling of dissatisfaction. One thing, though, is certain: if the pacing is wrong, it’s definitely going to bother your readers, so I thought I’d share some tips on how to keep the pace smooth and balanced.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">1. Current Story vs. Backstory</span>. </strong>Every character and every story has backstory. But the relaying of this information almost always slows the pace because it pulls the reader out of the current story and plops them into another one. It’s disorienting. And yet, a certain amount of backstory is necessary to create depth in regards to characters and plot. To keep the pace moving, only share what’s necessary for the reader to know <em>at that moment</em>. Dole out the history in small pieces within the context of the current story, and avoid narrative stretches that interrupt what’s going on. Here’s a great example from <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JOPE4C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007JOPE4C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theboomus06-20&amp;linkId=HUCY2PWK25CKUNEP">Above</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theboomus06-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B007JOPE4C" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></em>, by Leah Bobet:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>The only good thing about my Curse is that I can still Pass. And that’s half enough to keep me out of trouble. But tonight it’s not the half I need because here’s Atticus, spindly crab arms folded ‘cross his chest, waiting outside my door. His eyes glow dim-shot amber—not bright, so he’s not mad, just annoyed and looking to be mad.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Bobet could have taken a lengthy paragraph to explain that certain people in this world have curses that are really mutations, that Atticus has crab claws for hands and his eyes glow when he gets angry. But that would’ve slowed the pace and been boring. Instead, Bobet wove this information into the current story—showed Atticus leaning against the door, showed his crustacean claws and his freaky, glowing eyes so the reader knows that he’s a mutant and, to the narrator, at least, this is normal. This is an excellent example of the artful weaving of backstory into the present story.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2. Action vs. Exposition/Internal Dialogue</strong></span>. Action is an accelerant. It keeps the pace from dragging. Granted, there will be places in your story that are inherently passive, where characters have to talk, or someone needs to think things out. The key is to break up these places with movement or activity. Characters should be in motion—smacking gum or doodling or fidgeting— while talking. Give them something to do during their thoughtful moments, whether it’s peeling carrots or painting a picture. These bits of action are like an optical illusion, fooling the reader into thinking something’s happening, when really, nothing’s going on. This is one scenario when readers actually prefer to be fooled, so make sure to energize those narrative stretches with action.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3. Conflict vs. Downtime</strong></span>. On the flip side, you can’t have a story that’s all go and no stop. One might think that since action is good, more action is better. Not true. Readers need time to catch their breath, to recover from highly emotional or stressful scenes. A good pace is one that ebbs and flows—high action, a bit of recovery, then back to the activity again. Even <span style="color: #339966;"><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QE3CTY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QE3CTY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theboomus06-20&amp;linkId=2IG4LJI3M2O5DGFW">The Maze Runner</a></em></span>, possibly the most active novel I’ve ever read, has its moments of calm. When it comes to conflict and downtime, a definite balance is needed for the reader to feel satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4. Keep Upping the Stakes</strong></span>. We know that conflict is important—so important that every single scene needs it. But for conflict to be effective, it needs to escalate over the course of the story. To keep the reader engaged, each of the major conflict points needs to be bigger, more dramatic, and with stakes that are more desperate. One of my favorite reads of 2013 was Ruta Sepetys’ <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H4XCTQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004H4XCTQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theboomus06-20&amp;linkId=TEOJZCXPEJ6KWUZD">Between Shades of Gray</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theboomus06-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004H4XCTQ" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></em>, a historical fiction novel about the deportation of a Lithuanian family during World War II. It starts out ominous enough, with the family being forced from their home. Over the course of the story, they’re moved by cattle car across the continent, relocated to a forced labor camp, and eventually reach their final destination—a camp in the Arctic Circle where they’re expected to survive the elements with whatever resources they can scrounge. Clearly, lots of other conflict is interspersed, but when it comes to the major points, each one should have greater impact than the last.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>5. Condense the timeline</strong></span>. When possible, keep your timeline tight. If it gets too spread out, the story will inevitably drag. It’s also hard, in a story that covers a long span, to keep things smooth; there will be time jumps of weeks or months or even years between scenes. Too many of these give the story a jerky feel. So when it comes to the timeline, condense it as much as possible to keep the pace steady.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For sure, pacing is tricky, but I’ve found these nuggets to be helpful in maintaining a good balance. What other tips do you have for keeping your story moving at the right pace?</span></p>
