<ul>
<li><strong>Simon talks a bit about his background, with a degree in business</strong>, then working in Sri Lanka before moving to Prague. He started narrating audiobooks and working with indie authors, and then started his podcast, Rocking Self Publishing, before deciding to write a book about audiobooks to help authors get their books out there. We talk about the creative hub that Prague is turning into &#8230; We discuss entrepreneurship and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PW8TNX0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00PW8TNX0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=WPNVV7HYIWMKB4CX"><img class="alignright wp-image-20644 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-28-at-5.44.05-pm-196x300.jpg" alt="audiobooks for indies" width="196" height="300" /></a>the mindset shift from writing a book to running a business as an author.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why the audiobook market is growing so fast.</strong> Basically because Amazon is behind it, plus the advance of digital technology. People can consume while they do other things, and it&#8217;s on demand now through wireless technology. It can also help you stand out as there are far fewer books available in audio, plus Whispersync means people can combine editions on their Kindle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On ACX and how it works.</strong> You can also <a title="distributing with acx and marketing audiobooks" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/05/01/audiobooks-acx-marketing/" target="_blank">read more about my experience with ACX in publishing and marketing here</a>. We talk about pricing, ACX bounty, marketing, Whispersync and how the various payments work, as well as how to select a narrator.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best practices for working with a voice talent</strong>. We talk about adaptation, interpretation and respecting creative expression &#8211; as well as balancing it with how you want the book to be.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On fiction and non-fiction audiobooks.</strong> Often listeners want to hear the author read non-fiction, so if you can, narrate it yourself. For fiction, you need to do voices and things, so it&#8217;s best to get a professional. Simon talks about using basic equipment for audiobook narration &#8211; you don&#8217;t need to complicate things and it will only cost you a couple hundred $ to get started. Before you do anything, read your book out loud and see how you feel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Getting over your voice</strong>. We talk about becoming a narrator and how it can become another income stream, on when to take royalty split deals, and more. I am considering getting further into narration in 2015, only for non-fiction though.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On podcasting</strong> and when authors should consider it. We talk about the commitment in time per episode as well as how long it takes to get some traction with an audience. Like writing, it&#8217;s a long term game! We also talk a bit about <strong>video and YouTube</strong> &#8211; the most important thing is regular content. Most successful vloggers are doing videos several times a week. We also mention <a title="skype translator" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJIILew6l28#t=36" target="_blank">Skype Translator</a> &#8211; which translates as you speak &#8211; only in beginning stages, but wow! It&#8217;s like Star Trek!</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The fast-growing self-publishing environment is attracting all kinds of start-ups and companies that intend to serve authors.</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fensterbme/4783366926/ "><img class="alignleft wp-image-20513" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-16-at-5.40.24-pm-300x166.jpg" alt="editing" width="450" height="250" /></a>However, most of them seem to aim at the periphery of what authors really need, which in my opinion, is primarily editors and cover designers.</p>
<p>Then I met Ricardo Fayet at a number of events, and discovered that his start-up, <a title="Reedsy" href="https://reedsy.com/" target="_blank">Reedsy</a>, is aimed at connecting indie authors with editors and other professionals. The providers on the site are curated so you can trust that they offer a quality service.</p>
<p>Reedsy itself is a partner member of the <a title="alliance of independent authors" href="http://allianceindependentauthors.org/?affid=88" target="_blank">Alliance of Independent Authors</a>, which also gives it another level of trust, in my opinion. Here&#8217;s a piece on the company in <a title="techcrunch reedsy" href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/06/reedsy-launches-its-marketplace-for-indie-authors-to-unbundle-traditional-publishing-houses/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>.</p>
<p>I asked Ricardo a few questions about what he sees in successful indie authors and what Reedsy can do for them.</p>
<h2><strong>You go to a lot of author events. What are the commonalities you see in successful indie authors?</strong></h2>
<p>First, and this is something that has always struck me, I’m amazed at how <strong>indies are all such positive and energetic people</strong>. Or at least this is what they all appear to be (I know you have repeatedly said you have a<a title="JF Penn" href="http://www.jfpenn.com" target="_blank"> dark side</a> &#8211; I can’t imagine it, but I’ll take your word for it).</p>
<p>I think <strong>this kind of positive energy is absolutely key for indie authors today</strong>: you have got to believe that you can make it and persevere in your work with that belief until things begin to pick up. The process is slow and tedious and it’s easy to get discouraged after you’ve put the first couple of books out there and see they’re not selling themselves…</p>
<p>I also see <strong>a willingness to experiment.</strong> Distribution models have changed, and so have marketing ones. Thinking outside the traditional box usually pays off, but that requires a lot of trying new things and techniques, failing, and “iterating” (to use the start-up jargon).</p>
<p>Finally, I see<strong> union and an incredible willingness to help each other</strong>. All successful indie authors have become successful partly thanks to other authors. Bella Andre and Tina Folsom have been working together (literally) for years now. You have been interviewing authors for years too. <a title="alliance of independent authors" href="http://allianceindependentauthors.org/?affid=88" target="_blank">The Alliance of Independent Authors</a> was born out of this belief that indies don’t compete for space on the Kindle Store, they grow stronger together.</p>
<h2><strong>You&#8217;re a businessman and an entrepreneur with a start-up. What can indie authors learn from entrepreneurs? </strong></h2>
<p>All three points I mentioned in the previous questions! I think this is why we get on well together.</p>
<p><strong>As an entrepreneur, you also have to “build your team.”</strong> Once you do, entrepreneurs are faced with the same problem indies have once your product or your book is up and running: it doesn’t sell itself…</p>
<p>The difference is that entrepreneurs are often a little more educated about all the major challenges on the road from the start of their journey, whereas some starting authors go into self-publishing unprepared, or believing it will be relatively easy.</p>
<p>Start-up entrepreneurs are pushed by their investors to sell, so they market their product before it’s live, they beta-test it before releasing it, they continually improve it afterwards, etc. <strong>This pressure makes us more creative in our marketing efforts</strong>, and I think indie authors could get a lot of ideas by following the start-ups in their industry, reading their newsletters and observing their marketing efforts.</p>
<p>In way, it’s very difficult to remain oblivious to these challenges as an entrepreneur &#8211; there’s no temptation to develop a product in an ivory tower because it’s not an option.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://reedsy.com"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-20512" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/blog_post_image-300x168.jpg" alt="reedsy" width="300" height="168" /></a>One of the biggest problems for indie authors is finding professionals to work with. How does Reedsy help with this issue?</strong></h2>
<p>There’s all kinds of problems with finding good editors, designers, basically any variety of professional. Reedsy makes it easy to find and work with the best professionals &#8211; emphasis on both ‘easy’ and ‘best.’</p>
<p>Take editors as an example. First of all, there’s the challenge of finding them &#8211; Google is awesome, but if you search for ‘freelance editors’ you’re not being shown the best editors, but rather the editors who are best at SEO. Basically, there’s not much of a connection between visibility and quality.</p>
<p>Eventually you make your shortlist, and start exploring working together &#8211; maybe making a spreadsheet along the way of prices, of terms, sending out samples for editing, comparing what you get back… All which is this process you have to micromanage by designing a custom email folder hierarchy…</p>
<p>And that doesn’t even get into what’s involved in tracking drafts and the evolution of a manuscript across multiple rounds of editing. It’s exhausting.</p>
<div id="attachment_20514" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-20514" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-16-at-5.44.32-pm-215x300.jpg" alt="editing" width="250" height="348" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Example of Reedsy editor search with some of the freelancers available</p></div>
<p>So, Reedsy is an easy solution to all of this hassle. We have a growing network of great freelancers &#8211; respectful of their clients, established, experienced, skilled. You’ll be able to manage messaging freelancers, sending  and comparing sample edits, receiving quotes, and negotiating terms from one website. And when you start working together you’ll be able to track the history of the entire collaboration, from the very beginning, through our upcoming gorgeous editor.</p>
<p>The best thing about Reedsy is we make things easier for indie authors without taking away control. We make it an easy process, without taking it out of the author’s hands. That’s really important.</p>
<h2><strong>How can an author evaluate whether an editor or designer is the right one for them?</strong></h2>
<p>There’s all kinds of things authors need to think about when choosing who they want to work with. Looking at previous projects is an important one &#8211; not just whether the work is in a similar genre to your own work, but how you feel about the work that came out of the collaboration, whether you like the text after editing or like the cover design.</p>
<p>Authors should be totally honest about what they’re looking for from the freelancer. Not just because it’s important to make sure that expectations are clear all around, but to see how the freelancer responds. Collaborating with someone creatively can be intense, and it’s difficult to know how it’s going to go. Jumping in and being upfront about what you what (if you know what you want), or admitting your ignorance (if you don’t know what you need help with), can lead to a productive conversation. The earlier this happens, the better.</p>
<h2><strong>What else will Reedsy have coming up for authors?</strong></h2>
<p>Reedsy has a very specific purpose &#8211; to support independent authors. We’re building Reedsy like a toolbox. We’re starting with making something that can help with finding editors and designers. Naturally, we’ll add other professions over time &#8211; right now we’re planning to include publicists, narrators and translators.</p>
<p>But there are other tools we want to build for authors. The first of these is a text editor designed to support the process of creating book-length works, as well as making it more natural to share that work with your editor. We basically want to be more than a simple marketplace, and add value to the collaborations. This is why we’ll release the first set of project management tools in a few weeks only…</p>
<h2><strong>Would you consider having translators there too?</strong></h2>
<p>This should come in a month or two, yes. We’ll start with translators “into English” (not from), as we know many foreign authors wish to enter the US and UK markets but are unsure where to start… And also because translating is actually that: just a start! The book then needs to be copy-edited and/or proofread (in English), the cover needs to be modified (or redesigned), and the launch has to be accompanied by a marketing effort (in English).</p>
<p>On Reedsy, we already have all these resources (US/UK editors and designers), so foreign authors would access the full suite of services they need to really penetrate a new market. We’re going to be like Ellis Island for foreign authors arriving to the English-speaking market.</p>
<h2><strong>How can people find out more about Reedsy?</strong></h2>
<p>Our homepage &#8211; <a href="http://www.reedsy.com">www.reedsy.com</a> &#8211; would be a great start! If you’re an author, it’s free to sign up to the site and take a look around at who we have on the marketplace. If you’re a freelancer, it’s both free and very easy to build a profile and wait to be approached by authors. Reedsy is currently free during this beta stage, so there’s no reason not to take a look!</p>
<p>The other way of learning more is by asking us. We love the way the indie community supports itself, and we’re a part of that community. If you want a hand with anything, or want to know more, let us know and we’ll do what we can to help.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How David started writing</strong> in the 1980s and won a number of awards early on, as well as writing for many gaming and popular sci-fi properties plus green-lighting for Hollywood screenwriting. He started teaching and his students included Stephenie Meyer, James Dashner and Brandon Sanderson. His rules are that a project has to be fun and he has to be able to make some money at whatever he&#8217;s doing.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1614751765/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1614751765&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=WJNRKB5VNMCYUMDN"><img class="alignright wp-image-20538 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-19-at-1.30.09-pm-184x300.jpg" alt="million dollar outline" width="184" height="300" /></a>Writing the Million Dollar Outline</h2>
<ul>
<li>If it is your goal to write a bestselling novel, then you do need to consider certain principles. <strong>Write what you love but then figure out how to write for a wider audience than you started with</strong>. For example, old and young, male and female. The Harry Potter books clearly appeal to many different age groups.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transport your reader to another time and/or place.</strong> Generally speaking, the top 50 books and films of all time do this. We discuss the importance of length in this aspect – despite the recent move to shorter books, the biggest books of all time are doorstop size. You can use novellas over time to create &#8216;mega-novel&#8217; series though, and a lot of people are using this strategy, particularly in romance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>It must score high on the emotional Richter scale.</strong> It needs to impact people deeply and be remarkable so you get that word of mouth</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The word genre is really about emotions</strong> e.g. mystery = intrigue, thrillers = adventure, horror, comedy, fantasy &amp; sci-fi = wonder, romance = love. Nostalgia is another powerful emotion.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1614751749/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1614751749&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=KQVOOAGKAPCYM57S"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20539 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-19-at-1.30.28-pm-187x300.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2014-11-19 at 1.30.28 pm" width="187" height="300" /></a>Drawing on the power of resonance in writing</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resonance arouses an expectation that you&#8217;re going to like this type of book</strong>. Genre conventions are one aspect, cover design another, mentioning other books that people like is another. This is why similar tropes and characters are reused, as they have built in resonance. A good example was the recent Lego movie which was packed with resonance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This is not about plagiarism or re-using other material, but <strong>consciously choosing to riff off earlier ideas</strong>. David goes through the layers of resonance within Pirates of the Caribbean all the way back over centuries. You still have to be original, but add a twist on the past e.g. Meyer&#8217;s sparkly vampires.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Longevity and your career as a fiction writer</h2>
<ul>
<li>You have to be a good storyteller and be able to write well. <strong>There are a lot of skills you need to learn in order to be successful fiction author and it&#8217;s equivalent to getting a doctorate degree.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>It takes about 7 years to become &#8216;publishable&#8217; and another 7 years to become a bestselling author.</strong> To be one of the best, you have to take that onwards to the next level. <em>[I love this because I&#8217;ve been writing fiction for 4 years, so I am halfway through the apprenticeship!]</em> There are people who have some kind of special talent, but most great authors work really hard and practice over years.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On paying attention to dreams and writing them down</strong>. It&#8217;s your sub-conscious talking to you! David talks about his process, thinking about his plot before bed so he can dream about it that night and then write in the morning. Keep a notebook or computer handy at all times!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On fun and hard work as a writer. </strong>You have to consider your creative muse and not do the projects that don&#8217;t bring you alive. Figure out how to stay out of the ruts that the industry will try to put you in.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On author name and branding.</strong> Dave&#8217;s real name, Wolverton, put him on the bottom of shelves in bookstores so when he started writing, he changed to the name David Farland. That is less important in a digital market.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loving the craft is critical for longevity</strong>, or why would you bother! You can always learn something new so there is a sense of a career path ahead. Understanding the markets and being aware of what people want is critical.</li>
</ul>
<h2>On self-publishing</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mystorydoctor.com/"><img class="alignright wp-image-20544" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-19-at-2.16.29-pm-300x250.jpg" alt="my story doctor" width="250" height="209" /></a>It&#8217;s great to be able to publish in many different ways, and Dave self-publishes his books on writing. But <strong>sometimes authors are publishing too early</strong> and are slightly delusional in terms of their ability and expectations of income. It&#8217;s a great way to publish, but you need to learn the craft and get critical feedback before you can expect success.</li>
</ul>

<p>I started out with a <a title="business models for authors" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/07/25/creative-entrepreneur-business-models/" target="_blank">business model </a>of education through video courses, but now I focus more on books and sales through other online platforms.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a<a title="eu vat change" href="http://onemanbandaccounting.co.uk/eu-vat-changes-2015/" target="_blank"> law change in the EU</a> which means I will have to do a ton more compliance paperwork if I keep selling direct from 1 Jan 2015, and because my intention was to stop doing these over time, this has just accelerated the change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>I love to learn, and I&#8217;ve been sharing what I learn on this blog for almost 6 years now!</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/anned/8700093610/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20571" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-24-at-12.29.15-pm-300x198.jpg" alt="still learning" width="450" height="298" /></a>I had an email from a lady the other week and she asked me, <strong>&#8220;How do you continue when things are tough?&#8221;</strong> This could be about writing, or just life in general, but for me, it&#8217;s about constantly learning from others and changing based on what I learn.</p>
<p>When I first started this site, my mentors were people making a full-time living online and the mindset of entrepreneurship &#8211; <a title="from affirmation to reality" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2011/09/12/creative-author/" target="_blank">which helped me escape my day job</a>.</p>
<p>Then I learned about writing books and non-fiction, and then about writing fiction and deeper creativity. I feel like I circle around these topics, learning new things from new people all the time. I devour books every week, writing copious notes in my many Moleskine notebooks. I&#8217;m a learning junkie, but I also try to put things into action, and this keeps me constantly motivated.</p>
<h2>There have been some key mentors in my life, but all their teaching has come from books, seminars and online programs, not from 1:1 discussion.</h2>
<p>These people put their knowledge out in multiple formats to help a broader spectrum at one time, and I now try to do the same. When people email me asking to be mentored, I say &#8216;go read my books, read this blog, listen to the podcasts, or come and hear me speak&#8217; that&#8217;s how I pass on the mentoring relationship. I hope you will do the same with what you learn.</p>
<p>Our mentors change over time, so I wanted to highlight some of mine at the moment.</p>
<h2>Robert McKee STORY conference</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060391685/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060391685&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=NKM4T6GWPEX2QFLN"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20568 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-24-at-12.06.53-pm-196x300.jpg" alt="story" width="196" height="300" /></a>I&#8217;ve just returned from the<a title="McKee STORY" href="http://mckeestory.com/" target="_blank"> 4 day intensive STORY course</a> taught by Robert McKee, and it was absolutely mind-blowing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve now written <a title="McKee STORY" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/books/" target="_blank">8 fiction books</a> &#8211; from short stories, to novellas and novels, and I felt that this was exactly the right time for me to learn what he had to teach. I was going to blog about what I learned but seriously, I have 130 pages of notes and it was way too deep to try and capture in sound-bites. I&#8217;m also going to be processing for a few weeks before trying to incorporate it all into my 2015 creative works. It&#8217;s not about screenwriting, so much as story itself and how that resonates through people for maximum human impact.</p>
<p>If you want to check out this stuff, <a title="McKee STORY" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060391685/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060391685&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=NKM4T6GWPEX2QFLN" target="_blank">read the book STORY</a>, and if you are serious about investing in your creative writing career, then take the <a title="McKee STORY" href="http://mckeestory.com/" target="_blank">multi-day seminar</a>. He also has an <a title="storylogue" href="http://www.storylogue.com/" target="_blank">online video program, Storylogue,</a> but to be honest, I think the live experience is far superior (but obviously more expensive!)</p>
<h2>Dean Wesley Smith &amp; Kristine Kathryn Rusch</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BI88VGI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BI88VGI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=OHG53GGTJAIF7SC7"><img class="alignright wp-image-20567 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-24-at-12.06.29-pm-191x300.jpg" alt="perfection" width="191" height="300" /></a>Dean and Kris have 30+ years as full-time writers and they&#8217;ve seen the full spectrum of what the publishing industry can offer &#8211; from trad pub deals, to indie, to owning their own publishing company and physical bookstore.</p>
<p>Their advice is completely devoid of any hype or short term tactics, it&#8217;s all about <strong>creating a long-term successful career</strong> as an author. They are also both prolific writers and incredibly humble, plus they&#8217;re fun, and seem to have a good marriage <img src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> What better mentors to have!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read all their various non-fiction books and taken a number of courses. The ones that have particularly helped me are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="pursuit of perfections" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BI88VGI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BI88VGI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=OHG53GGTJAIF7SC7" target="_blank">The Pursuit of Perfection and How It Harms Writers</a></li>
<li><a title="productivity workshop" href="http://www.deanwesleysmith.com/online-workshops/" target="_blank">Course on Productivity</a> &#8211; how to write more words per day, get more hours in the chair and get out of your own way.</li>
<li><a title="dean lectures" href="http://www.deanwesleysmith.com/lecture-series/" target="_blank">Paying the Price Lecture</a> &#8211; for those who take this writing life seriously and want to have longevity in the market</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steven Pressfield</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087TUM54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0087TUM54&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=Z7RLSTOZROPQKVI7"><img class="alignleft wp-image-13657 size-full" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/turningpro.jpg" alt="Turning Pro Steven Pressfield" width="191" height="286" /></a><a title="turning pro" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087TUM54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0087TUM54&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=Z7RLSTOZROPQKVI7" target="_blank">Turning Pro</a> is the only book I own in print, ebook and audiobook. Pressfield kicks my ass every time I read or listen to it, and I make sure to read it every January to assess whether or not I am closer to being a &#8216;pro.&#8217;</p>
<p>When<a title="steven pressfield podcast" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/06/18/steven-pressfield/" target="_blank"> I interviewed Steve earlier this year on my podcast</a>, it was a true pinnacle, because talking to someone who had been a mentor to me for years was very special. You&#8217;ll hear it in my voice &#8211; I am a little star-struck!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been listening to the <a title="audiobook turning pro" href="http://www.blackirishbooks.com/store/turning-pro/" target="_blank">audiobook of Turning Pro</a> in the last few weeks, trying to up my creative game. Pressfield&#8217;s books are really about mindset and what really matters, leaving behind the ephemeral to get to the heart of why we do what we do.</p>
<p>His quote from Krishna is particularly important to me right now:<strong> &#8220;You have the right to your labor, not the fruits of your labor.&#8221; </strong>Think on that before moaning about book sales!<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<h2>Tony Robbins</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476757801/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1476757801&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=UOFVBLOYNKK67EIU"><img class="alignright wp-image-20558 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-11-19-at-2.47.10-pm-200x300.jpg" alt="money tony robbins" width="200" height="300" /></a>I&#8217;ve said before that I was so inspired by Tony&#8217;s self-help books and information that my aim was to become a professional speaker like him, and change people&#8217;s lives in the way he does. His book, <a title="awaken the giant within" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671791540/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0671791540&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=TEWO7MCVPZ7WYFOV" target="_blank">Awaken the Giant Within</a>, helped me to overcome a lot of mindset issues and start to create, another pivotal moment in my move from IT consultant to creativity. I&#8217;ve never been to one of his live events, although that is on my list for the next couple of years.</p>
<p>But Tony makes my list again at the moment because of his new book, <a title="money master the game" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476757801/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1476757801&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=UOFVBLOYNKK67EIU" target="_blank">Money: Master the Game</a>. It&#8217;s his first book in many years and comes from his anger over the 2008 global financial crisis and how the lack of financial education costs people far more than they could imagine. I consider myself a decent enough business-woman, but I have made my share of financial mistakes, both in business and in property. I&#8217;ve been reading this book slowly, and will continue to re-read until I understand it and have made the changes necessary to my own financial setup. It&#8217;s incredibly value packed and may change your life! I have bought the print edition as well as digital as it is the kind of book you need to digest slowly.</p>
<h2>Various podcasts</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-15030" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/smallpodcast.jpg" alt="podcast" width="133" height="126" />I listen to podcasts when I do chores or go to the gym, or travel and I find it&#8217;s a great way to learn about new things and discover lessons learned from people in all walks of life. I&#8217;m loving the <a title="tim ferriss podcast" href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/" target="_blank">Tim Ferriss show</a> at the moment and particularly enjoyed this <a title="kevin kelly" href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/08/29/kevin-kelly/" target="_blank">episode with Kevin Kelly</a>. I also like the <a title="james altucher show" href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/category/thejamesaltuchershow/" target="_blank">James Altucher show</a>, particularly <a title="altucher adams" href="http://www.stansberryradio.com/James-Altucher/Latest-Episodes/Episode/736/Ep-47-Scott-Adams-The-Secret-to-Dilbert-s-Success" target="_blank">this episode with Scott Adams, of Dilbert fame</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of self-publishing and related topics, I also listen to the <a title="self publishing podcast" href="https://selfpublishingpodcast.com/" target="_blank">Self-Publishing Podcast</a> (for laughs NSFW), the <a title="sell more books show" href="http://sellmorebooksshow.com/" target="_blank">Sell More Books show</a> (for news and marketing tips), the <a title="rocking self publishing podcast" href="http://rockingselfpublishing.com/" target="_blank">Rocking Self Publishing Podcast </a>(for deeper interviews with top self-publishers), and I&#8217;ve just started listening to<a title="the author biz" href="http://theauthorbiz.com/" target="_blank"> the Author Biz</a>, about author-entrepreneurship.</p>
<h2>Put away your self-development inner cynic!</h2>
<p>I hope I don&#8217;t have too many cynics in my audience &#8211; after all, my relentless positivity would probably put you off over time! The world I live is in brimming with possibilities and exciting projects and a never-ending stream of learning and creating. If your world doesn&#8217;t feel that way, then you need a kick in the creative rear!</p>
<p>These are just a few of my mentors at the moment who help me push the boundaries of what I can achieve in my week, my year and my life. You will need to find your own mentors for what you need to learn, but DO find them. After all, if you&#8217;re the smartest person in the room, you&#8217;re in the wrong room!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">I&#8217;d love to hear about some of your mentors, now or in the past, preferably from books/seminars/courses so others can benefit. Please do leave a comment below and join the conversation.</span></h3>

<p>In today&#8217;s episode, I talk about book cover design with <a title="book covers creativindie" href="http://bookcovers.creativindie.com/" target="_blank">Derek Murphy,</a> who designs all my book covers, plus we discuss the importance of artists also being entrepreneurial.</p>
<p>In the intro, I talk about my writing updates on <em>Gates of Hell</em> and <em>One Day in New York, </em>as well as the STORY conference I am going to with Robert McKee. I also mention the <a title="christmas thriller giveaway" href="http://thecreativepenn.com/christmas/" target="_blank">Christmas thriller giveway &#8211; win 12 print books here</a>.

<ul>
<li>Derek talks about his background in writing, studying at Taiwan University and his life abroad studying and writing, as well as fine art. He explains how he started an editing business and then moved into book cover design. In terms of marketing, book cover design business builds by word of mouth, whereas many authors won&#8217;t talk about the editing process. He&#8217;s traveled a lot internationally although he is American, studying in Malta in philosophy and theology and is now doing a PhD in Literature. We discuss academia vs entrepreneurship, and how to foster the latter by learning over time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>It&#8217;s important for artists to learn how to sell, as well as create, if they want to make a living from this.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MT9QYCI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00MT9QYCI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=CKFCP2VJ5L76RWUQ"><img class="alignright wp-image-20449 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-12-at-1.23.01-pm-202x300.jpg" alt="book cover design" width="202" height="300" /></a>What are the trends right now in book covers? For non-fiction, <em>Bebas neue</em> is being used a lot, and in fact, using fonts and words is prevalent in non-fiction in general, instead of being image heavy. For fiction, it depends on the genre.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>A big mistake for fiction authors with covers</strong> &#8211; trying to convey the whole story of the book on the cover with aspects of every scene, so it is very over-complicated. You really only have a couple of seconds to catch attention, and that&#8217;s the job of the book cover. It needs to convey genre, and be good looking so the reader knows they want more. If the reader is attracted, they will read title, book description and then get a sample.</li>
</ul>
<h2><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-20445" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/person-on-cover-300x140.jpg" alt="person-on-cover" width="300" height="140" />Using a person on the cover vs using a theme on the cover.</h2>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ve <a title="changing book cover design" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/03/11/changing-book-covers/" target="_blank">reinvented my Desecration book cover design to resonate more with genre and use a person on the front</a>, but sales are inconclusive. Derek talks about a cover he did recently (shown left) which has a reinvented theme only in the center and then with a person added as well &#8211; which do you prefer? A person is relatable so it has some kind of emotional impact. <a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/03/11/changing-book-covers/"><img class="alignright wp-image-18615 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/remake-300x253.jpg" alt="remake desecration" width="300" height="253" /></a>But in the end, the quality of the cover will make a huge cover.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We talk about the <strong>different cultural perspectives on covers</strong> &#8211; American covers vs European vs Asian. Cultural snobbery around literary covers in Britain does impact the design but may mean they don&#8217;t sell as well in America. Think about your target market and browse the categories in the country store for that market and make sure that your cover appeals to that market. Right now, we can&#8217;t upload different covers by market, but hopefully that will come at some point</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Big name author book covers and big name author websites &#8211; often they are not optimized to sell books, because those authors will sell books anyway. <strong>Over-complicating your covers and website is a bad idea for indies.</strong> The point of the cover is to get attention in the genre. The point of the website is to attract people to your email list and show up in search.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The most beautiful thing on your website should be your book covers.</h2>
<ul>
<li>On <strong>color palette, emotional resonance and genr</strong>e. It&#8217;s basic color psychology, which works all over the place e.g. what colors are used in hospitals vs boardrooms.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Top 3 bad things about indie book covers.</strong> Colors are a really obvious issue, and a color wash to neutralize the elements will help a lot. The font choice and effects are also important, and using drop shadows to make the font stand out is a classic error. You should use shading and font <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HC6HQ70/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00HC6HQ70&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=DF6BER3LKI3O756T"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20454 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-12-at-1.44.07-pm-203x300.jpg" alt="book marketing is dead" width="203" height="300" /></a>choice to make it stand out. An another issue is the amount of text on the cover. You don&#8217;t want to cram it full of text, especially for fiction in terms of quotes, sub-titles etc. We talk about the <a title="book cover design awards" href="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/2014/09/e-book-cover-design-awards-august-2014/" target="_blank">eBook Cover Design Awards on The Book Designer </a>which is a great site to find designers and see what works.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Finding and working with a book cover designer</h2>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s not necessarily about them being nice! You don&#8217;t want to be the one doing the design, you don&#8217;t want them to do what you want, because you don&#8217;t know about design. Trust your designer because of their experience. I have a list of <a title="book cover design" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/bookcoverdesign/" target="_blank">book cover designers here</a>. To get a good cover design, you will be paying quite a bit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Derek has a lot of tools for authors who want to try it themselves. Here&#8217;s <a title="book cover design" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2013/10/20/book-cover-design-ms-word/" target="_blank">how to make your own cover in MS Word</a>, and here&#8217;s a whole load of templates on <a title="DIY Book covers" href="http://diybookcovers.com/" target="_blank">DIYBookCovers.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>On becoming more entrepreneurial</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is critical for authors and artists. You need to think about the reader, the product, the marketing, the business side &#8211; once you&#8217;ve at least written that first book. Marketing doesn&#8217;t work if you have a product that nobody wants. Think about creating value for other people. How can you improve other people&#8217;s lives? How can you entertain, educate or inspire? Derek talks about some of the ideas he has at the moment &#8211; he&#8217;s an entrepreneurial machine! We also talk about fear of failure and how you have to get past that as an entrepreneur.</li>
<li>Derek talks about his own novel, Shearwater, and what he&#8217;s doing with his own books going forward.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find Derek at his website <a title="creativindie" href="http://www.creativindie.com" target="_blank">Creativindie.com</a> and also at <a title="DIY Book covers" href="http://diybookcovers.com/" target="_blank">DIYBookCovers.com</a> as well as on twitter <a title="creativindie" href="http://www.twitter.com/creativindie" target="_blank">@creativindie</a></p>

(http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/derekcovers-201x300.png)Professional editing and professional cover design.
In today's episode, I talk about book cover design with Derek Murphy, (http://bookcovers.creativindie.com/) who designs all my book covers, plus we discuss the importance of artists also being entrepreneurial.

In the intro, I talk about my writing updates on Gates of Hell and One Day in New York, as well as the STORY conference I am going to with Robert McKee. I also mention the Christmas thriller giveway - win 12 print books here (http://thecreativepenn.com/christmas/). I'm speaking in Auckland, New Zealand on Tues 16 Dec, click here for more details (http://www.thecreativepenn.com/nz14/), as well as at PubSenseSummit  (http://www.pubsensesummit.com/)in Charleston in March 2015.

(http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-12-at-12.40.49-pm-202x300.jpg)Derek Murphy is an author, cover designer and entrepreneur at Creativindie.com (http://www.creativindie.com), as well as working on his PhD in Literature.

You can listen above or on iTunes (https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-creative-penn/id309426367) or Stitcher (http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-creative-penn-podcast), watch the interview on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb8eeRtoo4Q), or read the notes and links below.

	* Derek talks about his background in writing, studying at Taiwan University and his life abroad studying and writing, as well as fine art. He explains how he started an editing business and then moved into book cover design. In terms of marketing, book cover design business builds by word of mouth, whereas many authors won't talk about the editing process. He's traveled a lot internationally although he is American, studying in Malta in philosophy and theology and is now doing a PhD in Literature. We discuss academia vs entrepreneurship, and how to foster the latter by learning over time.

It's important for artists to learn how to sell, as well as create, if they want to make a living from this.

	* (http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-12-at-1.23.01-pm-202x300.jpg)What are the trends right now in book covers? For non-fiction, Bebas neue is being used a lot, and in fact, using fonts and words is prevalent in non-fiction in general, instead of being image heavy. For fiction, it depends on the genre.


	* A big mistake for fiction authors with covers - trying to convey the whole story of the book on the cover with aspects of every scene, so it is very over-complicated. You really only have a couple of seconds to catch attention, and that's the job of the book cover. It needs to convey genre, and be good looking so the reader knows they want more. If the reader is attracted, they will read title, book description and then get a sample.

(http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/person-on-cover-300x140.jpg)Using a person on the cover vs using a theme on the cover.

	* We've reinvented my Desecration book cover design to resonate more with genre and use a person on the front (http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/03/11/changing-book-covers/), but sales are inconclusive.</itunes:summary>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Everybody wants to know the best way to write, to publish, to market.</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/airflore/3779918167/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20491" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-13-at-7.13.39-pm-300x224.jpg" alt="skiing" width="450" height="336" /></a>But although there are tracks to follow and experts to emulate, there really is no single right way to do anything in the author life. We will all have a different journey.</p>
<h2>Imagine that you want to ski down a hill.</h2>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t ski, hopefully you&#8217;ve seen enough Bond movies to know how it works! It&#8217;s similar to our journey through life and also applies to writing, marketing and any kind of business or career.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<h2>(1) Your path is not a straight line. You have to zigzag.</h2>
<p>Even though you know the general direction you want to head in, you can&#8217;t direct yourself straight down the mountain, or you will certainly have an accident.</p>
<p>Even pros have to change direction and turn their skis across the slope. There is no direct path, so don&#8217;t expect there to be.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also not just one path &#8211; everyone has a different route to get down, so you can try to follow other people&#8217;s example but you will end up carving your own path. In my book, <a title="career change" href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/careerchange/" target="_blank">Career Change</a>, I talk about all my various failed businesses before I found my true path as an author. It&#8217;s a zigzag journey for us all.</p>
<h2>(2) It&#8217;s easier to turn once you&#8217;re moving.</h2>
<p>You need some momentum in order to turn on skis, so you actually have to get moving before you try.</p>
<p>In the same way, you actually have to start writing in order to have something to edit and improve. You have to start with a crappy website so you can learn how to make it better.</p>
<p>You have to start marketing somehow so you can learn what works for you and improve over time.</p>
<h2>(3) You can&#8217;t learn it all from books: you have to get on the slope.</h2>
<p>You can&#8217;t be a great skier by reading about it or going to seminars or watching YouTube videos. You actually have to put in the hours skiing.</p>
<p>The same applies to writing, publishing and marketing. People often assume that I have some kind of degree in marketing, but I don&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve just been out there every day for five years learning on the slopes – emulating the pros, yes – but mainly doing it for myself.</p>
<h2>(4) You&#8217;re going to fall over and it&#8217;s going to hurt. But you get better over time.</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re afraid of falling over, you will never be a good skier. Because you will fall, it happens a lot and it has to happen if you&#8217;re going to push yourself to get better and go on more advanced runs. So be prepared to fall, to fail, and to just get up again. Keep writing, keep putting your words out and keep experimenting with marketing.</p>
<h2>(5) Some days, the weather is perfect and you can see for miles and the sun is shining and it&#8217;s amazing!</h2>
<p>This is meant to be fun!</p>
<p>Yes, being an author can be a career and an income, but it&#8217;s also a passion. The reason we keep going back to skiing, keep going back up the slope, is that <strong>there is exhilaration and joy in the process, not just the outcome</strong> of getting to the bottom.</p>
<p>Some days, the weather will be perfect and we will have amazing runs on pristine, soft snow. Other days, the icy cold will make us grit our teeth to even manage one run and we wish we hadn&#8217;t bothered. But we keep going back because we love it, and those amazing days when it all falls into place make it worth it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>I have a degree in Theology and my interest in religion is enmeshed in my fiction.</h3>

<li>Jeremy talks about his <strong>background in politics and religion</strong>, starting in Washington DC working with a Senator and then became a pastor for politicians.

<li>The Christian market is a <strong>$1.2 billion market</strong>, around 10% of the broader US publishing market. Christians buy more books and spend more money on books than the average reader. This explains why the big publishers have bought out many of the independent presses in this area.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When we talk of the Christian market, it is usually catered towards the <strong>Evangelical</strong> side of things and they often purchase from Christian stores. Those type of bookstores may not purchase from indie authors, as they are not necessarily known entities whose work has been checked as doctrinally sound.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The sub-genres reflect the mainstream</strong> e.g. Christian romance, Christian suspense, Christian sci-fi etc. We talk about Amish fiction, often a kind of historical romance. We talk about some more edgy genres as well. I mention <a title="left behind" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MGV8W06/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00MGV8W06&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=HC24QJYTVD2MNPZP" target="_blank">Tim LaHaye&#8217;s Left Behind </a>series in particular, which has sold over 63 million books and is post-apocalyptic with a lot of violence and an edge of horror.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Christian readers are generally <strong>more tolerant of violence than swearing or sex</strong>. We talk about Mormon fiction, and I mention <a title="the righteous" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005J61DDI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005J61DDI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=OBALUJLEQ5I5W2AU" target="_blank">Michael Wallace&#8217;s The Righteous series</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We talk about the <strong>wider global Christian market</strong>, and I talk about the Catholic markets of Spain, Brazil and the Latino, Spanish speaking market in the US which is more Catholic. We talk about the growth of Christianity in Africa, South America and Asia and how the change in demographics will impact publishing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Is there a mainstream renaissance in biblical stories? (or big stories?)</h2>
<ul>
<li>With Noah out earlier this year, and Exodus coming out before Christmas, we talk about a longing for &#8216;bigger&#8217; stories, and how Hollywood have also woken up to the hungry market for these types of films. We talk about the awesome stories that are in the Bible and how many of them are being adapted.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I talk about the gap that my books fall through, as well as others &#8211; <strong>I write religious fiction, but not Christian fiction</strong>. Jeremy mentions the peer acceptance that is needed for books appealing to Christians, they need to be doctrinally sound to be acceptable in that market. Or, books can just be great stories that tangentially talk about religion or spirituality.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you are a Christian writing books for the Christian market, there is an entire eco-system of blogs and review sites etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Having an endorsement from a known Christian personality is important</strong>.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OYWP000/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00OYWP000&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=TEARJ6LNXMGCRPMN"><img class="alignright wp-image-20370 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/thereandbackagain-199x300.jpg" alt="thereandbackagain" width="199" height="300" /></a>It shortcuts the alignment with spiritual convictions. We talk about the changing nature of self-publishing within the evangelical market.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We discuss <strong>branding around yourself</strong> when you&#8217;re encouraged not to make it about yourself as a Christian. But a personality is important to build know, like and trust and Jeremy&#8217;s discusses how he did this, and how uncomfortable it was at the beginning.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jeremy talks about his coming of age novel, <a title="from there and back again" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OYWP000/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00OYWP000&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=TEARJ6LNXMGCRPMN" target="_blank">From There and Back Again</a> which will be out early 2015.

		<itunes:summary>I have a degree in Theology and my interest in religion is enmeshed in my fiction.
I write books that can be described as religious thrillers, and yet I'm not a Christian, although I do describe myself as spiritual. In today's show, I interview Jeremy Bouma (http://www.jeremybouma.com/) about the complexities of the Christian publishing market, and you'll learn a lot about the sub-niche as well as customer targeting and much more, even if you're not a Christian author.

In the introduction I mention my personal writing updates, as well as the Goodreads event on Nov 15th when you can join me and other authors for chat and giveaways (https://www.goodreads.com/event/show/946923-online-chat-with-bestselling-authors-strong-heroines-day-of-the-vikin), plus the Christmas mystery/thriller giveaway when you can win 12 print books (http://noorosha.com/giveaways/christmas-giveaway/) (let us buy your Christmas presents for you!)

Jeremy Bouma (http://www.jeremybouma.com)(http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/JeremyBouma-300x289.jpg) is the author of non-fiction and fiction books, as well as an entrepreneur. Jeremy was previously an evangelical Christian pastor and writes for HarperCollins Christian Publishers, as well as dealing with the questions of faith in his books and on his blog. Today we're talking about aspects of the Christian publishing market.

	* Jeremy talks about his background in politics and religion, starting in Washington DC working with a Senator and then became a pastor for politicians. After a crisis of faith, Jeremy found himself getting deeper into his Christianity. He began blogging and did post-grad studies in Theology and then started writing books. His first being 'The Unoffensive Gospel of Jesus (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008PT1HO6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008PT1HO6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=YQEUM2DVKDUVHIGA).' He now does content marketing with Harper Collins Christian publishers.


	* On how writing helps us work out what we believe. I work this out in my fiction, and Jeremy talks about how his non-fiction books have helped him. We discuss the academic side of writing vs the kind of thing that appeals to the wider public. It's important to consider who your audience is and how to connect with them.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I attended the <a title="london screenwriters festival" href="http://www.londonscreenwritersfestival.com/" target="_blank">London Screenwriter&#8217;s Festival</a> which was a cornucopia of fascinating information and networking packed into a couple of intense days.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.londonscreenwritersfestival.com/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20410 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-05-at-9.29.28-pm-300x148.jpg" alt="london screenwriters" width="300" height="148" /></a><strong>Authors can learn a lot from screenwriters</strong>, especially in an age where there&#8217;s some amazing television. After getting rid of the physical TV six years ago, we&#8217;ve been downloading and devouring shows like House of Cards, Game of Thrones and True Detective, and I am always a sucker for action movies!</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s face it &#8211; more people watch TV and films than read books.</h2>
<p>More people devour stories through the visual medium.</p>
<p>So I decided to go and find out a little more about possibly adapting my own books into screenplays, and what the screenwriting world was about. As usual, I am not content to sit back and wait! Here are some of my notes from the days I attended.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Storytellers need to be passionate, creative people and rise above the resigned and cynical world we live in.&#8221;</h2>
<p><a title="Chris Jones" href="http://www.chrisjonesblog.com/about" target="_blank">Chris Jones</a> opened the festival with a rousing speech to get out there and create the stories that ignite passion within you. He talked about how others may think we&#8217;re crazy and tell us to get a real job, but at events like this, we are amongst peers. We know each other.</p>
<h3>Choose the people you spend time with wisely and they will buoy you up in this creative career.</h3>
<p>I feel this a lot in the author community, and avoid any toxic situations/ forums/ people as much as possible. Life is short &#8211; it&#8217;s important to make good choices about who we spend it with.</p>
<p><a href="http://lyndalaplante.com/books/"><img class="alignright wp-image-20411 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-05-at-9.37.19-pm-300x133.jpg" alt="lynda la plante" width="300" height="133" /></a>Screenwriter and novelist <a title="Lynda la plante" href="http://lyndalaplante.com/" target="_blank">Lynda La Plante</a> gave a great talk about her journey. She&#8217;s a fantastic example of an author-entrepreneur, moving from acting into writing and then into running her own company in order to have more creative control over her work.</p>
<p>She talked about <strong>&#8216;going back to Source,&#8217;</strong> when researching her work, not in a metaphysical sense, but actually visiting criminals, prisons, police stations and morgues to learn the reality from the people who live it.</p>
<h2>&#8220;The roots of a good story are in reality.&#8221; Lynda La Plante</h2>
<p>She suggested always including comedic elements in dark books to break the tension, and that the gore level of the current crime scene will swing back soon as it has gone too far and people are more interested in the hunt than the violence.</p>
<p><a title="william nicholson" href="http://www.williamnicholson.com/" target="_blank">William Nicholson</a><a href="http://www.williamnicholson.com/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20413" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-06-at-12.47.53-pm-300x208.jpg" alt="shadowlands" width="250" height="174" /></a>, screenwriter for Shadowlands, Mandela and Gladiator, as well as many more screenplays and also novels, talked about his journey in one fantastic session. He talked, as did others, about<strong> the disappointment of the screenplays that get sold but never made</strong>. Many of the speakers commented on how some of their best work would never see the light of day as it wouldn&#8217;t get made but the rights had been sold.</p>
<p>The focus of the session was on heightening emotion, the heart of all great drama. William writes by choosing the emotion he wants the audience to feel, connecting to that within himself and then structuring around that.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Screenwriters don&#8217;t write lines. They write stories.&#8221; William Nicholson</h2>
<p>He also mentioned that researching too much was a bad thing, as we&#8217;re not writing reality, we&#8217;re writing stories that communicate values.</p>
<p>William mentioned that he only started screenwriting after several very serious novels, and <strong>his writing loosened up when he stopped taking himself and his writing so seriously</strong>.</p>
<p>[This advice is something I have also learned from Dean Wesley Smith in his brilliant <a title="dean wesley smith productivity" href="http://www.deanwesleysmith.com/online-workshops/" target="_blank">Productivity workshop</a>.]</p>
<p>William suggested choosing something that other people care about as a theme, and not focusing on yourself as the writer. You&#8217;re not as interesting as a resonant theme or topic.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-20414" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-06-at-12.51.20-pm-219x300.jpg" alt="the lost boys" width="219" height="300" />There was also a great session with Joel Schumacher where the film of The Lost Boys was played on the big screen, and he talked about the various shots as the film progressed. We were also able to download the script and read along.</p>
<p>That process was a real revelation to me, and it was fascinating to hear from the Director himself how the story was structured to appeal to the audience. He said, &#8220;we had no idea it would be this big,&#8221; and Nicholson said the same of Gladiator.</p>
<p>It seems to be a theme, <strong>you just don&#8217;t know when things will blow up</strong>, so just keep creating the stories you love.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Dialogue is not real conversation. It&#8217;s the illusion of conversation.&#8221; Claudia Myers</h2>
<p>In one session on dialogue, <a title="claudia myers" href="http://claudiamyersfilms.com/profile.php" target="_blank">Claudia Myers</a> went through the four key elements. It must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advance the plot</li>
<li>Reveal character</li>
<li>Give exposition</li>
<li>Set the tone</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the reasons I wanted to attend the festival was to focus on dialogue as it is something that novelists need to work on constantly. The first solution to revealing character is always action/ behavior, but then it&#8217;s dialogue. Not speaking is sometimes just as powerful as speaking.</p>
<p><strong>Good dialogue should also work sub-textually &#8211; people often don&#8217;t say what they really think.</strong> There are forces that make us say things we don&#8217;t mean, and we need to communicate that through sub-text. A good example of this comes from the pitching sessions. When an agent says &#8220;I&#8217;ll get back to you,&#8221; without providing their contact details, it&#8217;s likely that they actually mean, &#8220;No thanks, it&#8217;s not for me.&#8221;</p>
<h2>&#8220;Write a bad scene and then fix it.&#8221; Claudia Myers</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/quinnanya/4692181263/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-18074 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/quotationmarls-300x204.png" alt="quotation marks" width="300" height="204" /></a>The &#8216;rules&#8217; for screenwriting are very similar to novels, and a lot of dialogue can be fixed in a second pass.</p>
<p><a title="on the page" href="http://www.onthepage.tv/">Pilar Allesandra</a> did a session on the craft, and used some great examples from scripts to demonstrate how important word choice is for genre. She also suggested picking a small &#8216;tell&#8217; that reveals what a character is really thinking i.e. subtext.</p>
<p>For example, two people bump into each other, one says &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; but rolls their eyes. You show their annoyance through the physical response, that&#8217;s the subtext to the dialogue.</p>
<p>She also had a tip for revealing character without constraining the casting options. Compare the two:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vanessa, a beguiling vamp</li>
<li>Vanessa (25) tall, blonde, wearing a cocktail dress</li>
</ul>
<p>The first option describes the character but leaves the casting open to actresses of all kinds.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Eventually the book becomes this forgotten thing &#8211; a sacred text that nobody looks at any more.&#8221; Ted Tally</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CMV1N4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002CMV1N4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=WM52STB5GLNQ7BAM"><img class="alignright wp-image-20418 size-medium" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-06-at-1.18.37-pm-198x300.jpg" alt="silence of the lambs" width="198" height="300" /></a>There was a revealing session by Ted Tally, who won an Oscar for the <a title="silence of the lambs" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CMV1N4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002CMV1N4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=WM52STB5GLNQ7BAM" target="_blank">adaptation of &#8216;The Silence of the Lambs</a>.&#8217;</p>
<p>He talked about choosing books to adapt, how he reads a lot and is always hoping to discover something unusual, but usually gets pitched and sent things from agents. <strong>He wants to find compelling characters more than anything else</strong>, since plot and dialogue can be fixed, but the character is critical from the start.</p>
<p>He&#8217;ll read a book several times and work on a treatment, and then a first draft. Subsequent drafts are done from the treatment, rather than the book.</p>
<p>Most execs and people involved in the film won&#8217;t have read the book, which is why so many films get further and further from the original text. They just don&#8217;t know the material and don&#8217;t necessarily want to. The original author and the screenwriter are not usually around on set &#8211; although they are in some cases, and Ted was for Silence of the Lambs, as was Thomas Harris, the author.</p>
<h2>The adaptation is the screenwriter&#8217;s take on the book, their enhancement of the original work.</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not just the book turned into the movie.</p>
<p>The choices that the screenwriter makes can change the film into something different. For example, the choice of Clarice as the main focal character meant a lot of the book&#8217;s other POV characters were minimized, changing the depth of their characters in the movie. <strong>The adaptation screenwriter slashes the book apart and their freedom is that first draft, when they re-imagine.</strong> <em>[That part does actually sound pretty fun to me, as I love editing!]<strong><br />
</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/wahlander/3873255763/"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20421" src="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-06-at-1.43.35-pm-300x180.jpg" alt="popcorn" width="450" height="270" /></a>Very occasionally, there is a brilliant book that doesn&#8217;t need much work in adaptation. Ted said of <a title="all the pretty horses" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I9VXYK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000I9VXYK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hotoenyojo-20&amp;linkId=GYDD2D3ZVT4EVHN5" target="_blank"><em>All the Pretty Horses</em></a>, &#8220;it didn&#8217;t need a screenwriter, it just needed a typist.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>As an author, I felt a real respect for the screenwriters who adapt novels</strong>, and I&#8217;d be keen to work with someone to adapt my books, as I have done with translators and audiobook narrators.</p>
<h2>Collaboration is a powerful way to move a story onwards.</h2>
<p>Once again, the writers talked about their disappointment. Ted Tally said &#8220;some of the best scripts I&#8217;ve ever written haven&#8217;t been produced and maybe never will be.&#8221; That melancholic statement seemed to be part of the general acceptance of a screenwriter&#8217;s lot, and the aspiring screenwriters suggested this was just part of the journey. You work hard until the magical moment of seeing your name on the credits of a TV show or film. That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re working for, along with the pleasure of writing and the paychecks that (occasionally) come.</p>
<h2>My personal conclusions</h2>
<p>It was great to attend the event because it solidified a few things for me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I love the control of being indie and I love the speed of getting my creative work into the world</strong>. I love reaching readers with my stories and being paid 90 days later for that work. I don&#8217;t want to wait years for someone to pick my book (or my script) and I don&#8217;t want to give up creative control and be ignored once the work is accepted. So basically, I don&#8217;t want to write a screenplay and I won&#8217;t be adapting my books into scripts myself.<em> [At least right now! Never say never!]</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>I would LOVE to have my books (properties) optioned for film/ TV</strong> and I would be a gem of an author to work with when it comes to adaptation (honest!) I&#8217;m enjoying the collaborative process of translation and I think adaptation would be similar. It&#8217;s respecting someone else&#8217;s creativity and their interpretation of your work.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had some great <em>aha</em> moments over the weekend and it helped me to formulate my own strategy for the film/TV market. I highly recommend the festival if you&#8217;re at all interested in screenwriting, or even if you want to learn some tips from another type of writer.
