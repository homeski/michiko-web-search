style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DbjPv7GDLmQ/VGz_KhfFlWI/AAAAAAAACfk/Ec4WgATQhOg/s1600/AuthorUphillBattle.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left;

width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;First the good news.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For indie (self-published) authors, there’s never been a better time to publish an ebook.&amp;nbsp; Thanks to an ever-growing global market for your ebooks, your books are a couple clicks away from over one billion potential readers on smart phones, tablets and e-readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Smashwords author, you have access to tools, distribution and best practices knowledge to publish ebooks faster, smarter and less expensively than the large publishers can.&amp;nbsp; In the world of ebooks, the playing field is tilted to the indie author’s advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now the bad news.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything gets more difficult from here. You face an uphill battle. With a couple exceptions – namely Scribd and Oyster – most major ebook retailers have suffered anemic or declining sales over the last 12-18 months.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gravy train of exponential sales growth is over.&amp;nbsp; Indies have hit a brick wall and are scrambling to make sense of it.&amp;nbsp; In recent weeks, for example, I've heard a number of indie authors report that their sales at Amazon dropped significantly since July when Amazon launched &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/07/is-kindle-unlimited-bad-for-authors.html"&gt;Kindle Unlimited&lt;/a&gt; (I might write about Kindle Unlimited in a future blog post).&amp;nbsp; Some authors are considering quitting.&amp;nbsp; It’s heartbreaking to hear this, but I’m not surprised either.&amp;nbsp; When authors hit hard times, sometimes the reasons to quit seem to outnumber the reasons to power on.&amp;nbsp; Often these voices come from friends and family who admire our authorship but question the financial sensibility of it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writer's life is not an easy one, especially when you're measuring your success in dollars.&amp;nbsp; If you're relying on your earnings to put food on your family's table, a career as an indie author feels all the more precarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At times like this, it’s important for all writers to take a deep breath, find their grounding, remember why they became an author in the first place, and make important decisions about their future.&amp;nbsp; It’s times like this that test an author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t fail the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in December, in my &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/12/2014-book-publishing-industry.html"&gt;annual publishing predictions for 2014&lt;/a&gt;, I speculated that growth in the ebook market would stall out in 2014.&amp;nbsp; I wrote that after a decade of exponential growth in ebooks with indies partying like it was 1999, growth was slowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote that the hazard of fast-growing markets – the hazard of the rapid rise of ebooks – is that rapid growth can mask flaws in business models.&amp;nbsp; It can cause players to misinterpret the reasons for their success, and the assumptions upon which they build and execute their publishing strategy. Who are these players?&amp;nbsp; I’m talking about authors, publishers, retailers, distributors and service providers – all of us.&amp;nbsp; It’s easy to succeed when everything’s growing like gangbusters.&amp;nbsp; It’s when things slow down that your beliefs and underlying assumptions are tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I urged authors to embrace the coming shakeout rather than fear it.&amp;nbsp; Let it spur you on to become a better, more competitive player in the months and years ahead.&amp;nbsp; Players who survive shakeouts usually emerge stronger out the other end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s causing the slowdown?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While every individual author’s results will differ from the aggregate, I think there are several drivers shaping the current environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; There’s a glut of high-quality ebooks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;There’s been a lot of hand-wringing by self-publishing naysayers who criticize the indie publishing movement for causing the release of a “tsunami of drek” (actually, they use a more profane word than “drek”) that makes it difficult for readers to find the good books.&amp;nbsp; Yes, indie publishing is enabling a tsunami of poor-quality books, but critics who fixate on drek are blinded to the bigger picture. Drek quickly becomes invisible because readers ignore or reject it.&amp;nbsp; The other, more important side of this story is that self-publishing is unleashing a tsunami of high-quality works.&amp;nbsp; When you view drek in the broader context, you realize that drek is irrelevant.&amp;nbsp; In fact, drek is yin to quality’s yang.&amp;nbsp; You must have one to have the other.&amp;nbsp; Self-publishing platforms like Smashwords have transferred editorial curation from publishers to readers, and in the process has enabled publication of a greater quantity and diversity of high-quality content then ever possible before.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest threat to every indie or traditionally-published author is the glut of high-quality low-cost works.&amp;nbsp; The quality and potency of your competition has increased dramatically thanks to self-publishing, and the competition will grow stiffer from this day forward.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years ago, publishers artificially constrained book supply by publishing a limited number of new titles each year, and by agents and publishers rejecting nearly everything that came in through the slush pile. There was an artificial scarcity of books.&amp;nbsp; The supply was further constrained by the inability of physical brick and mortar bookstores to stock every title.&amp;nbsp; Even big box stores like Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and Borders could only stock a small fraction of the titles published by publishers each year, and as such they were forced to return slow-selling books to make room for new releases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rapid loss of shelf space for the poor sellers forced many high-quality books out of print before they had a chance to connect with readers.&amp;nbsp; This then limited the supply of available books, which limited the competition for the authors whose publishers managed to keep their books in print and on store shelves.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We’ve moved from a world of artificial scarcity to organic abundance.&amp;nbsp; Readers now enjoy a virtually unlimited selection of low-cost, high quality works, and these books will become ever-more plentiful and ever-more higher-quality in the years ahead thanks to self-publishing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; The rate of growth in the supply of ebooks is outstripping the growth in demand for ebooks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;A few things are happening here.&amp;nbsp; Ebooks are immortal, so they never go out of print.&amp;nbsp; Like cobwebs constructed of stainless steel, they will forever occupy the virtual shelves of ebook retailers, forever discoverable.&amp;nbsp; This is both good and bad.&amp;nbsp; It’s good your book is immortal, because it means you can look forward to harvesting an annuity stream of income for many years to come, especially for great fiction because fiction is timeless.&amp;nbsp; But it means that every year there will be more and more books for readers to choose from.&amp;nbsp; Unless the number of readers and the number of books read by readers grows faster than the number of titles released and ever-present, there will be fewer eyeballs split across more books. This means the average number of book sales for each new release will decline over time unless readership dramatically increases, or unless we see an accelerating pace of transition from print reading to screen reading. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. The rate of transition from print books to ebooks is slowing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;The early adopters for ebooks have adopted.&amp;nbsp; The exponential growth in ebook sales over the last six years was driven by a number of factors, most notably a rapid transition from print reading to ebook reading, and the success of ebook retailers such as Amazon, iBooks and Barnes &amp;amp; Noble.&amp;nbsp; Today, ebooks probably account for between 30 to 35% of dollar sales for the US book market, with genre ebook fiction a bit higher and romance quite a bit higher.&amp;nbsp; Since ebooks are priced lower than print, the 30-35% statistic understates the amount of reading that has moved to screens.&amp;nbsp; Most likely (especially when you include free ebooks), screen reading in the ebook format today probably accounts for around half or more of all book words read.&amp;nbsp; But the rate of transition from print to ebooks is slowing.&amp;nbsp; We’ve reached a state that might best be described as a temporary equilibrium.&amp;nbsp; I think reading will continue to transition to screens, but at a much slower rate of transition than during the last six years.&amp;nbsp; The slower rate of growth will therefore limit the number of new eyeballs available for the ever-growing supply of ebooks. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to Succeed in the Future Competitive Landscape&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The easy days are behind you, but tremendous opportunities still lie ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tXicFREun-8/VG0mZMyWqKI/AAAAAAAACf4/lWosgrsIpDI/s1600/authorUpHill2Success.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tXicFREun-8/VG0mZMyWqKI/AAAAAAAACf4/lWosgrsIpDI/s1600/authorUpHill2Success.png" height="238" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;As I mentioned at the start of this post, there's never been a better time to be an indie author.&amp;nbsp; Millions of readers are hungry to discover, purchase and read their next great book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s how to succeed in the new environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; Take the long view&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;You’re running a marathon, not a sprint.&amp;nbsp; Most bestsellers slogged away in obscurity for years before they broke out.&amp;nbsp; Every bestselling author you admire faced moments where it seemed more sensible to quit than to power on.&amp;nbsp; They powered on. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Work today to create the future you want 10 or 20 years from now.&amp;nbsp; Six years into the ebook revolution, you’re still early in the game. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;In any market, whether fast-growing or slow-growing, the early movers have the advantage.&amp;nbsp; Although it was easier two years ago to grow readership than it is today, today it’s still dramatically easier to grow your readership than it will be two years from now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Focus now on aggressive platform building.&amp;nbsp; Build a social media platform - using tools such as Facebook, Twitter, a blog and a private mailing list - that you control. You 'll find platform-building is the most difficult when you're first  starting out.&amp;nbsp; You'll also find as you grow your platform and your following,  it gets easier as your readers become your evangelists.&amp;nbsp; Social media in all its forms rewards those who add value. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Authors who attract and capture the most readers today have the greatest opportunity to convert those fans to lifelong super fans.&amp;nbsp; Super fans will buy everything you write and will evangelize your work through word of mouth, reviews and social media.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; Good isn’t good enough&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;With the glut of high-quality books, good books aren’t good enough anymore.&amp;nbsp; Cheap books aren't good enough (Smashwords publishes over 40,000 free ebooks).&amp;nbsp; The books that reach the most readers are those that bring the reader to emotionally satisfying extremes. This holds true for all genre fiction and all non-fiction.&amp;nbsp; If your readers aren’t giving you reviews averaging four or five star and using words in their reviews like, “wow,” “incredible” and “amazing,” then you’re probably not taking the reader to an emotionally satisfying extreme.&amp;nbsp; Extreme joy and pleasure is a required reading experience if you want to turn readers into fans, and turn fans into super fans.&amp;nbsp; Wow books turn readers into evangelists.&amp;nbsp; Last year I wrote a post titled, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/03/six-tips-to-read-reader-tea-leaves-how.html"&gt;Six Tips to Bring Your Book Back from the Doldrums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It's a self-assessment checklist that prompts you to take an honest look at your reviews, your cover image, your categorization and targeting. With some simple questions and honest answers, you'll be ready to give your books a makeover.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; Write more, publish more and get better&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;The more you write and publish, the greater your chances of reaching readers.&amp;nbsp; The more you write, the more opportunity you have to perfect your craft.&amp;nbsp; What are you writing next?&amp;nbsp; Get it on preorder now.&amp;nbsp; Never stop writing.&amp;nbsp; Never stop growing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; Diversify your distribution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;There’s a global market for your English-language books.&amp;nbsp; Smashwords can help you distribute to iBooks, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, Scribd, Oyster, Kobo and public libraries.&amp;nbsp; iBooks, for example, operates stores in 51 different countries and has become the world’s second largest seller of ebooks.&amp;nbsp; Each of these 51 countries represents its own unique micro-market.&amp;nbsp; If you’re not there with your entire list of books, then you’ll face long term disadvantage against the majority of Smashwords authors who’ve been building their fan bases for the last few years with uninterrupted global distribution.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;If you don’t have all your books available at every retailer, you’ll undermine your long term potential. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;At every writers conference I attend, I’m surprised by the number of indie authors who ask, “How do I decide between Amazon and Smashwords?”&amp;nbsp; The question belies an unfortunate truth about the state of indie publishing – a scary large number of authors publishing at Amazon think Amazon requires exclusivity.&amp;nbsp; Not true!&amp;nbsp; Yes, they'll poke and prod you to go exclusive, but you can say no.&amp;nbsp; I recently wrote a short post for the IBPA (International Book Publishers Association) on this subject titled, &lt;a href="http://www.ibpa-online.org/article/exclusive-is-actually-optional-at-amazon/"&gt;Exclusive is Actually Optional at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Do your indie author friends a favor and help them understand the benefits of global distribution.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Network with fellow indies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;As I wrote in the &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/04/indie-author-manifesto.html"&gt;Indie Author Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, indie does not mean “alone.”&amp;nbsp; It takes a village to publish a professional-quality book.&amp;nbsp; Network with your fellow indies at writers conferences and local writers groups.&amp;nbsp; Share experiences and support one another through the good times and bad.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Publish multi-author box set collaborations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;When authors publish and promote multi-author box sets, they can amplify their fan-building by cross-marketing to each participating author’s fan base.&amp;nbsp; Box sets work best when every author pitches in on the promotion. Check out my recent blog post on &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/08/how-to-do-box-sets-at-smashwords-for.html"&gt;how to do multi-author box sets&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Partner with authors you love, and who you think your readers will love.&amp;nbsp; Be a great partner!&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Leverage professional publishing tools&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Over the last couple years at Smashwords, we’ve introduced a number of new tools that give our authors a competitive advantage in the marketplace, such as &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/09/new-smashwords-series-manager-improves.html"&gt;Smashwords Series Manager&lt;/a&gt; for enhanced series discovery, and &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/07/smashwords-introduces-preorder.html"&gt;preorder distribution&lt;/a&gt; to iBooks, Barnes and Noble and Kobo.&amp;nbsp; Yet despite the availability of these tools, they’re not universally adopted.&amp;nbsp; Even though we’ve proven and communicated that books born as preorders sell more units that other books, only a minority of Smashwords authors release their books as preorders.&amp;nbsp; Take advantage of these tools.&amp;nbsp; They give you a competitive advantage!&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Best practices bring incremental advantage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;There’s no single magic bullet that will make your writing career take off.&amp;nbsp; The secret is that you must do many things right and avoid mistakes that will undermine your career.&amp;nbsp; The many things you must do fall under the umbrella of best practices. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;As I wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/145431"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Secrets to Ebook Publishing Success&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in my discussion of Viral Catalysts, it's helpful to think of your book as an amorphous blob, and attached to it are dozens of dials, levels and knobs that you can twist, turn and tweak to make your book more available, more discoverable and more desirable. What are these things you can tweak and adjust?&amp;nbsp; I'm talking about your editing, your cover, your book description, pricing, categorization, etc. Once you get the combination of settings just write, your book will start selling.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Best practices are what separate the indie author professionals from the indie author wannabees.&amp;nbsp; Be the pro!&amp;nbsp; Even if you're already a bestseller, challenge yourself to do better.&amp;nbsp; Find those things you're not doing that you should be doing better. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;So here’s some good news for you.&amp;nbsp; Although the indie author community is more professional and sophisticated than it was five years ago, the fact remains that most indie authors don’t fully exploit the power of best practices.&amp;nbsp; There's plenty of low-hanging fruit on the best practices tree that they're ignoring.&amp;nbsp; This means if you fully exploit best practices, you’ll have a significant advantage over the majority of authors who do not. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Here's a quick summary of some of the most commonly underutilized best practices:&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;1.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; Many indies release their books without professional editing and proofreading.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;2.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; A surprising number of authors end their book with a period and that’s it, and not with &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/11/how-to-add-navigation-to-smashwords.html"&gt;enhanced back matter and navigation&lt;/a&gt; that drives sales of your other books and drives the growth of your social media platforms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt; 3.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; Although indie authors are releasing books with better quality covers than ever before, a surprising number of authors still release books with low-quality homemade covers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;4.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; A lot of series writers haven’t yet experimented with free series starters, even though free series starters are proven to drive more readers into series and yield higher overall series earnings.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt; Many series writers don't yet link their series books in Smashwords Series Manager, even though this tool increases the discoverability of series books at Smashwords and at Smashwords retailers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt; 6.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; Even though we’ve published strong evidence three years in a row in our Smashwords Surveys (&lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/07/2014-smashwords-survey-reveals-new.html"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/05/new-smashwords-survey-helps-authors.html"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2012/04/can-ebook-data-reveal-new-viral.html"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;) that longer ebooks sell better than shorter ebooks, some authors still divide full length books into shorter books that can disappoint readers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;7.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt; Sloppy descriptions.&amp;nbsp; You'd be surprised at the number of book descriptions that have typographic errors, or improper casing or punctuation.&amp;nbsp; Readers pick up on this stuff.&amp;nbsp; Mistakes like this are like a slap in the face of your prospective reader.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;To long time readers of the Smashwords blog, you're probably already familiar with many of the proven best practices I mentioned above. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;If you want a refresher on best practices, please take some time to read my free ebook, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/145431"&gt;The Secrets to Ebook Publishing Success&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Over 30 best practices are described there.&amp;nbsp; And read the&lt;a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/305"&gt; &lt;i&gt;Smashwords Book Marketing Guide&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more than 40 free book marketing and author platform-building ideas.&amp;nbsp; And then take some time to review my prior blogs posts here, or watch my &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/user/Smashwords"&gt;ebook publishing tutorial videos at YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Indie authors pioneered many of these best practices.&amp;nbsp; I learn from you and your fellow authors, and share what I learn.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. You’re running a business&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Mark’s Unconventional (but proven effective) Rules for Business:&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;1.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; Be a nice person. Treat partners, fellow authors and  readers with kindness, respect and integrity. You'll find as you develop your career, the publishing industry will feel smaller and smaller as you get to know everyone, and as everyone gets to know you.&amp;nbsp; It takes a village to reach  readers.&amp;nbsp; All these people - fellow authors, critique partners, beta readers, editors,  publishers, cover designers, publicists, retailers, and distributors - have the power to open doors for you.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;2.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;  Be honest.&amp;nbsp; Business relationships are built on trust and honesty.&amp;nbsp; The fastest way to destroy a relationship is to be dishonest.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;3.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;  Be Ethical. Don't cheat. Do unto others as you’d want done unto you.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt; Be Humble.  Yeah, I’ve told you have superawesome potential within you.&amp;nbsp; But know that you can always be better.&amp;nbsp; Celebrate those who  help you succeed.&amp;nbsp; Always know that none of us can achieve anything  without the support, encouragement and love of those around us.&amp;nbsp; It  takes a village.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Pinch your pennies (an American saying that means, "be frugal with your money")&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Practice expense control.&amp;nbsp; Your sales will always be uncertain, but your expenses can be controlled.&amp;nbsp; Jealously guard your pennies.&amp;nbsp; If you can’t afford professional editing, for example, find another way to obtain it.&amp;nbsp; A couple months ago at the Rocky Mountain Fiction Writers conference, I gave a presentation on best practices.&amp;nbsp; To underscore my suggestion that writers find another way to get professional editing if they can’t afford it, I pointed out an editor friend in the audience and suggested that if authors couldn’t afford to pay for her services consider offering her something of value in exchange.&amp;nbsp; Tongue in cheek, I said, “if you’re a professional masseuse, offer massage services.” To my surprise, I learned afterward that two professional masseuses in the audience handed the editor their business cards at the end of the presentation.&amp;nbsp; You've got skills.&amp;nbsp; Get creative.&amp;nbsp; Trade editing with fellow authors.&amp;nbsp; Trade services in exchange for professional cover design.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Time Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Do you have too many hours in the day?&amp;nbsp; Of course not.&amp;nbsp; Organize your time so you’re spending more time writing and imagining, and less time with the menial grunt work.&amp;nbsp; Smashwords can help on the distribution side.&amp;nbsp; Consolidate your distribution to reap the time-saving benefits of centralized publishing control and metadata management.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Take risks, experiment, and fail often&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Success is impossible without failure.&amp;nbsp; Failure is a gift.&amp;nbsp; The challenge is to take a lot of little risks and make every failure a teachable moment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. Dream big dreams&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Be  ambitious.&amp;nbsp; Aim high.&amp;nbsp; You’re smart and you’re capable.&amp;nbsp; You must  believe this.&amp;nbsp; Because if you don’t try, you can’t achieve.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Salvador  Dali said:&amp;nbsp; "Intelligence without ambition is a bird without wings."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. Be delusional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;At the Pikes Peak writers conference three years ago, I had a fun conversation with uber-agent Donald Maas. Don had just told a room full of writers that self-publishing was a fine option if they didn't want to sell any books.&amp;nbsp; Later that night, we crossed paths at dinner.&amp;nbsp; I told him I thought he was underestimating the impact self-published authors would have on the publishing industry.&amp;nbsp; He told me he thought I was delusional. When someone doubts me, I feel energized. To have vision - to see what doesn't yet exist - that's delusional.&amp;nbsp; Be delusional. What's your vision?&amp;nbsp; Know that every NY Times bestseller was absolutely nuts to write a book.&amp;nbsp; Most books fail, so common sense would advise getting a job at McDonalds instead. Three months ago, three years after my conversation with Mr. Maas, Inc. Magazine named Smashwords to its &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/08/inc-magazine-names-smashwords-to-inc.html"&gt;INC 500 list&lt;/a&gt; of America’s fastest-growing companies in recognition of indie authors at Smashwords who sold over $30 million worth of books at retail last year. Who’s delusional now?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;15. Embrace your doubters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;They know not of what they speak. They’re delusional too. They can't yet see what you see. They can't see what' s in your imagination.&amp;nbsp; Give ‘em a hug.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;16. Celebrate your fellow authors’ success&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Your fellow authors' success is your success, and yours theirs. When you achieve success, do everything you can to pause a moment and lift up your fellow authors to join you. A journey shared is more satisfying than a journey alone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;17. Past success is no guarantee of future success &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I think about this a lot at Smashwords. The world is cyclical. You’ll have ups and downs. When you’re having a great run, enjoy it, soak it in, bank it, pay off debts and build your savings for a rainy day.&amp;nbsp; The rainy day will come. And then keep working. Never stop sprinting as fast as you can in the direction of your dreams.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;18. Never Quit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Never give up. Quitting guarantees failure.&amp;nbsp; If you never quit, you’ll never fail.&amp;nbsp; Stamina and staying power beat the sprint.&amp;nbsp; Think of the story of the tortoise and the hare. Fight for your right to pursue the best career in the universe.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;19. Own Your Future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;In the past, you were dependent upon publishers.&amp;nbsp; Now it’s all you.&amp;nbsp; Your success or failure is your own. You’re the writer and the publisher.&amp;nbsp; You decide how you publish.&amp;nbsp; You choose your partners.&amp;nbsp; If you succeed or fail, it’s on you.&amp;nbsp; Avoid finger pointing and celebrate those who help you succeed.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;20. Know that your writing is important&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Books are important to the future of mankind. You are the creator of books.&amp;nbsp; That makes you special, and it also burdens you with a special responsibility. No one else can create what you have within you. Your writing represents the manifestation of your life, your dreams, your soul and your talent. You’re special. Others might think you’re suffering from delusions of grandiosity but so what?&amp;nbsp; What do they know?&amp;nbsp; If you don’t believe in yourself, who will?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Find success and satisfaction in the journey of publishing.&amp;nbsp; Know that the measure of your importance and the measure of your contribution to book culture and humanity cannot be measured by your sales alone.&amp;nbsp; The moment you reach your first reader, you’ve done your part to change the world.&amp;nbsp; And that’s just the beginning. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you publish for the right reasons and you adopt best practices that  make your books more available and more desirable to readers, your  future is as bright as your imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for everything you do.&lt;img src="//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Smashwords/~4/JBTxS5zwzuY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Smashwords/~3/JBTxS5zwzuY/ebook-publishing-gets-more-difficult.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Mark Coker)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DbjPv7GDLmQ/VGz_KhfFlWI/AAAAAAAACfk/Ec4WgATQhOg/s72-c/AuthorUphillBattle.png" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>51</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/11/ebook-publishing-gets-more-difficult.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7436915084701775452.post-4966807201048695732</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2014 01:39:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2014-11-15T20:41:09.149-08:00</atom:updated><title>The Amazon Hachette Dispute Comes to a Pyrrhic End</title><description>&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;

I'm glad it's over.&amp;nbsp; As I discussed in a &lt;a href="http://www.ninc.com/blog/index.php/archives/mark-coker-interview-part-2"&gt;NINC interview&lt;/a&gt; last month, the dispute evoked a lot of unnecessary ugliness in certain quarters of the indie author community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the heart of the dispute was the Agency pricing model for ebooks, which meant it was a battle was over pricing and margin.&amp;nbsp; According to most press accounts, Hachette wanted the freedom to set consumer prices and earn 70% list for its ebooks, and Amazon wanted to pay Hachette lower margins so it could fund deeper discounting.&amp;nbsp; I covered the dispute back in &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/05/amazons-hachette-dispute-foreshadows.html"&gt;May here at the Smashwords blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to carefully worded statements this week by Amazon and Hachette - neither of which boasted of victory - Hachette will retain Agency pricing control yet conceded to certain unnamed Amazon demands that will incentivize lower pricing from Hachette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not easy to pick winners and losers.&amp;nbsp; As with most wars, even winners can be losers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's my attempt to examine the winners and losers of this episode, along with speculation on long term implications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hachette  *mostly* won&lt;/b&gt;, but is now boxed into a position where faithful authors  will expect higher net royalty rates for ebooks as well as other  perceived reforms from publishers.&amp;nbsp; The Author's Guild has already hinted as much.&amp;nbsp; In a &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.authorsguild.org/advocacy/amazon-and-hachette-shake-hands-on-distribution-deal-hachette-authors-no-longer-in-limbo/#more-6562"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; this week commemorating the agreement, Authors Guild president Roxana Robinson took the opportunity to urge Hachette to raise ebook royalty rates for authors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amazon mostly lost&lt;/b&gt;, because it appears Agency  wasn't dismantled or critically injured.&amp;nbsp; Amazon will likely seek revenge  through other means (see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agency mostly won&lt;/b&gt;. It dodged a  bullet to the benefit of publishers and indie authors alike, and to the  benefit of Amazon's retail competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amazon mostly lost on the  PR front&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Amazon's heavy handed tactics confirmed the industry's worst  fears about Amazon.&amp;nbsp; Word of Amazon's heavy-handedness leaked out into  the mainstream media where it probably tarnished Amazon's otherwise  pristine image in the minds of consumers who were paying attention.&amp;nbsp;  Amazon dare not replay the same overt tactics again unless it wants to  rip the scar off of the bloody putrid mess and invite people to connect  dots back to the Amazon/Hachette dispute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amazon boxed in&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Just as Hachette is  boxed in with expectations of payback from their defenders, so too is Amazon.&amp;nbsp; If Amazon puts  the squeeze on indie authors and their 70% list, their supporters will  cry foul ("&lt;i&gt;Hey, I defended you like a loyal pit bull in your dispute  with Hachette!&lt;/i&gt;")&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author affinity for publishers damaged&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Amazon partisans orchestrated a rage-fest against traditional publishers, further eroding the once divine reputation of traditional publishers. Amazon partisans used this dispute as an opportunity to paint all  publishers with the broad brush that publishers don't care about  authors, want to exploit authors, want to overcharge customers for ebooks to protect their print businesses, collude on pricing, and who knows what else, strangle  puppy dogs?&amp;nbsp; All good conspiracies are grounded in a small amount of truth.&amp;nbsp; Yes, no doubt, publishers have much opportunity to bring reforms that benefit authors, though I thought the vitriol was excessive.&amp;nbsp; I also believe that indie authors are well-served by a thriving and profitable traditional publishing industry because it creates more publishing options for all authors.&amp;nbsp; When indies go too far to tear down publishing houses, they risk tearing down their own house as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors attacking authors&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Successful traditionally published authors who stood by publishers were attacked.&amp;nbsp; This, to me, was one of the most unfortunate outcomes.&amp;nbsp; When authors are attacking authors, you know the world has gone mad.&amp;nbsp; It was all the sadder that most of these attacks came from the indie author community.&amp;nbsp; Indies should be better than this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Any perceived victory for publishers will likely  prove Pyrrhic.&lt;/b&gt; The Hachette agreement, which was itself preceded by Simon &amp;amp; Schuster reaching new terms with Amazon, will likely be followed by other publishers striking similar deals now that the goal posts are planted in the ground.&amp;nbsp; To the extent Amazon feels it was forced to settle, this  settlement will dredge up their bitter memories of the time  publishers forced Amazon to move to Agency in 2010.&amp;nbsp; Amazon  doesn't like it when others exert power over it.&amp;nbsp; Can you blame Amazon?&amp;nbsp; No one appreciates feeling powerless.&amp;nbsp; Amazon prefers its  supplier frenemies divided, conquered and dependent. If it can't crush  Agency, it will try to neuter the publishers who use it. It views  publishers as fat middlemen to be disintermediated, their fat to be rendered  away and conveyed to the bellies of customers. Although Amazon's ability to replay their heavy-handed Hachette playbook  is limited, I expect they'll exact a different type of revenge in the  form of discoverability and merchandising. Think of it as passive-aggressive. Amazon  will redouble efforts to undermine the power of publishers by diverting  more reader eyeballs to indie books in &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2011/12/amazon-shows-predatory-spots-with-kdp.html"&gt;KDP Select&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/07/is-kindle-unlimited-bad-for-authors.html"&gt;Kindle Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;, and to Amazon imprints that are  exclusive to Amazon.&amp;nbsp; Amazon has every right to arrange their own shelves. Let's call it  the cloak of invisibility that no author or publisher wants to wear.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Like with most battles, all combatants lost a little something in end.&amp;nbsp; Here's wishing the industry greater peace and prosperity in the future.&lt;img src="//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Smashwords/~4/c_Ii-spu7FY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Smashwords/~3/c_Ii-spu7FY/the-amazon-hachette-dispute-comes-to.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Mark Coker)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6-_j3jyxBbM/VGahyQNuA4I/AAAAAAAACfU/8qH81K3KehU/s72-c/Pyrrhus.JPG" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>13</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/11/the-amazon-hachette-dispute-comes-to.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7436915084701775452.post-7443995030355442538</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2014 00:58:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2014-09-19T17:01:46.785-07:00</atom:updated><title>iBooks Launches Worldwide Book Bundles Promotion, Features 41 Smashwords Box Sets and over 200 authors</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bgjIDfRQJ2w/VBty3ZOMDII/AAAAAAAACe8/PwYeXL0YS4s/s1600/ibooksbundles.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bgjIDfRQJ2w/VBty3ZOMDII/AAAAAAAACe8/PwYeXL0YS4s/s1600/ibooksbundles.png" height="148" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;iBooks today launched a major worldwide merchandising feature that includes 100 box sets, 41 of which are from Smashwords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For readers looking to discover their new favorite authors, the collections offer a treasure trove of amazing authors.&amp;nbsp; $99.00 will get you hundreds of books!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The featured Smashwords box sets include the works of over 200 Smashwords authors.&amp;nbsp; View the merchandising feature at iBooks, or view on your web browser via iTunes by &lt;a href="http://tw.apple.com/bookbundles"&gt;clicking here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feature showcases books in the categories of Contemporary Romance, Crime &amp;amp; Thrillers, Historical Romance, Paranormal, Sci-Fi &amp;amp; Fantasy, and Teen &amp;amp; Young Adult. Apple plans to promote the feature globally in the US, Australia, UK, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last month I blogged about &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/08/how-to-do-box-sets-at-smashwords-for.html"&gt;box sets as a significant audience-building tool&lt;/a&gt; for indie authors. With box sets, multiple authors collaborate to produce and publish an anthology of books organized around a theme.&amp;nbsp; Each author then co-promotes the box set to their respective fan bases, which thereby amplifies the overall reach for all participating authors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today we see that a great box set also opens the opportunity for merchandising love, as in the case with iBooks today.&amp;nbsp; The timing of the iBooks promotion is especially great for the participating Smashwords authors. Tomorrow is when Apple will release the new iPhone 6 family of larger-screen smart phones to customers.&amp;nbsp; But more importantly, yesterday Apple released iOS8, their new mobile operating system for iPhones, iPods and iPads.&amp;nbsp; For the first time ever, the iBooks app comes preloaded on the home screen of users.&amp;nbsp; As I blogged back in June, &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/06/apples-new-ios-8-is-game-changer-for.html"&gt;iOS8 is a game changer&lt;/a&gt;, and for anyone who doubts Apple's ambition to become the #1 global seller of ebooks, well... they're not paying attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;iOS8 will drive millions of new readers to the iBooks store, placing readers that much closer to your books.&amp;nbsp; Yesterday (Wednesday September 17), the first day iOS8 become available to users, Smashwords authors experienced an 84% increase in downloads over the prior day (amazing).&amp;nbsp; Although one day doesn't make a trend, the surge in downloads is a strong sign that the transition to iOS8 will likely bring many new readers to iBooks and to Smashwords authors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the Smashwords box sets were created expressly for this Apple promotion. A few weeks ago I invited a number of Smashwords bestsellers to serve as anchor authors to orchestrate new box sets for this promotion.&amp;nbsp; I challenged them to partner with fellow indies they'd be proud to promote to their own fan bases.&amp;nbsp; The results were extraordinary.&amp;nbsp; Over 200 authors contributed.&amp;nbsp; They created amazing titles, themes and covers.&amp;nbsp; Many are raising money for charity.&amp;nbsp; Participating authors comprise New York Times bestsellers, USA Today bestsellers and up-and-coming indies who are likely to become your new favorite authors in the years ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you might imagine, it was a lot of work for these authors to pull it off in such as short time.&amp;nbsp; Their accomplishment points to an opportunity for every Smashwords author:&amp;nbsp; Box sets represent a great opportunity for Smashwords authors to collaborate with their fellow indies to publish and co-promote a value-priced book that will put your work in the hands of more readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrats Smashwords authors, and thanks so much for your hard work in pulling this together!&amp;nbsp; And thank you iBooks for creating such an awesome promotion and selecting these titles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Participating Smashwords Box Sets&lt;/h3&gt;Below is a listing of the selected box sets and their participating authors, in no particular order.&amp;nbsp; Click the link to view or purchase the iBooks page for each box set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/faery-worlds-six-complete/id912001097?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=11"&gt;Faery Worlds - Six Complete Novels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; featuring: Jenna Johnson and Anthea Sharpe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/dangerous-lovers/id845276276?mt=11"&gt;Dangerous Lovers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; featuring: Becca Vincenza, H.

Magazine bases its ratings on three-year revenue growth.&amp;nbsp; With audited revenue of $706,000 in 2010 and $22 million in 2013, Smashwords showed 3,019% growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Credit for this achievement goes first and foremost to Smashwords authors and publishers.&amp;nbsp; Nearly 100,000 indie authors and small independent presses today utilize Smashwords as their ebook publishing and distribution platform.&amp;nbsp; We provide you to tools, and you publish amazing books that bring reading pleasure to millions of readers.&amp;nbsp; It's because you entrusted your books to Smashwords that we've been able to share in a small piece of your success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LKcdunuirf0/U_UkzGux-vI/AAAAAAAACec/05AfqaxPzsU/s1600/sw1media.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LKcdunuirf0/U_UkzGux-vI/AAAAAAAACec/05AfqaxPzsU/s1600/sw1media.png" height="98" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The rise of Smashwords is the story of the rise of self publishing.&amp;nbsp; Self published authors now have the freedom and capability to publish with complete pride and professionalism.&amp;nbsp; The stigma that once haunted self-published authors is quickly melting away as Smashwords authors and publishers set the standard for ebook publishing best practices.&amp;nbsp; You are the pioneers who will lead book publishing to a better, more democratic future.&amp;nbsp; You are the future of publishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been singing the same tune for six and half years.&amp;nbsp; It's great to see authors embracing their new-found freedom, believing in themselves and serving readers with high-quality, low-cost ebooks.&amp;nbsp; It's great to see how the rise of indie ebooks has fulfilled the dreams and changed the lives of so many Smashwords authors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This milestone also wouldn't have been possible without the hard work of my team at Smashwords.&amp;nbsp; From vetting to service to finance and engineering and marketing, every Smashwords team member comes to work with the single-minded purpose to serve writers.&amp;nbsp; We're here to provide you a competitive advantage in the marketplace. We exist for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We realize that every Smashwords author works with us by choice.&amp;nbsp; We're thankful you choose to do business with us. We strive to reciprocate by giving you full access to our ever-growing and ever-improving suite of tools that connect you with readers.&amp;nbsp; We offer these tools without cost and without exclusivity.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you choose to fully distribute with Smashwords, you're directly supporting our ability to invest in the development of new tools, new distribution and new capabilities to help you reach more readers.&amp;nbsp; As long as you work with us, we're here to work with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Smashwords business has been profitable for over three years, and we've managed to maintain this profitability while reinvesting in the business to give you competitive advantage. This is a low margin business, which means we must make difficult decisions every day to prioritize our resources.&amp;nbsp; It means we cannot and should not try to be all things to all people.&amp;nbsp; We're focused on the logistics of connecting ebooks with readers.&amp;nbsp; When prioritizing resources, we ask, "what will give our authors the greatest aggregate benefit?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;How We Got Here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MyWX3YRVQ-o/VBBh2FhXOeI/AAAAAAAACes/Um4tjzW8OUs/s1600/INC0914_cover.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MyWX3YRVQ-o/VBBh2FhXOeI/AAAAAAAACes/Um4tjzW8OUs/s1600/INC0914_cover.png" height="200" width="151" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I'm often asked how we got here, wherever &lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt; is.&amp;nbsp; I suppose here today is the milestone we're celebrating.&amp;nbsp; Smashwords is an Inc. 500 company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As most Smashwords authors know, I was inspired to start Smashwords after my wife and I wrote a novel together.&amp;nbsp; Despite representation from a top tier literary agency, publishers were unwilling to take a chance on it.&amp;nbsp; The experience led me to realize that publishers held too much power, because they alone decided which writers graduated to become published authors.&amp;nbsp; They decided which manuscripts became books, and they decided what readers could read.&amp;nbsp; My vision for Smashwords was to turn everything upside down and give all the power to writers and readers.&amp;nbsp; Give writers the freedom to publish what they want, and give readers the freedom to read what they want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although only in my wildest dreams did I dream Smashwords would reach such a milestone, I never expected it.&amp;nbsp; In fact, I knew the odds were stacked against us.&amp;nbsp; I thought the business would most likely fail.&amp;nbsp; In the darkest days early on - those days when on a good day we were earning only $1.00 a day in commission - the thing that kept me going was my belief that the world &lt;i&gt;needed&lt;/i&gt; a Smashwords.&amp;nbsp; I had faith that if I could give all writers a chance, and few of them would break out and change everything for all writers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've traveled a lot of ground in six and half years.&amp;nbsp; We've overcome numerous roadblocks, experienced our fair share of growing pains, made our fair share of mistakes and took a lot of bullets.&amp;nbsp; We've also received a lot of love, and that sustains us more than anything.&amp;nbsp; We've had the good fortune to work with amazing authors and amazing retailer business partners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The business has been entirely self-funded without the assistance or interference of venture capitalists or outside investors.&amp;nbsp; This has given us the freedom to build a business around some very simple if not unconventional principles which guide how we manage the business.&amp;nbsp; I'll share them now for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Smashwords Business Principles&amp;nbsp; &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every writer is special, and holds the potential to contribute something worthwhile to the culture of books.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every writer should have the freedom to publish at no cost.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The worth of a writer's book cannot be measured by sales alone.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The money should flow from reader to author.&amp;nbsp; We only earn commission if we help authors sell books.&amp;nbsp; We believe this aligns every fiber of our business - every motivation, every decision and every action - with the best interests of our authors and publishers.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We serve our authors and publishers by working to enable a diverse and vibrant global ecosystem of multiple ebook retailing channels.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We believe it's in every author's best long term interest that we promote broad and diversified distribution.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We believe in the value of a great distributor. We believe distributors will become more important in the future, not less so.&amp;nbsp; A good distributor provides efficient  digital logistics for the benefit of authors, publishers, retailers and  readers alike.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We constantly strive to become a better distributor.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We believe that authors who leverage the full benefits of a distributor will be more successful over the long term than those who do not.&amp;nbsp; Distributors help authors spend more time writing and less time on distribution.&amp;nbsp; It's about time management.&amp;nbsp; Time is every writer's most precious asset.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We believe past success is no guarantee of future success.&amp;nbsp; Success must be earned.&amp;nbsp; The moment we stop innovating and adding value to the publishing and distribution experience of our authors and readers, we lose our right to exist.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Innovation is messy. We promise we will blaze new trails and take  prudent risks. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will always strive to work in the best interest of our writers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will make mistakes and we will learn from our  mistakes. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will help and encourage our retailer partners to improve their businesses for the benefit of our authors, publishers and their readers.&amp;nbsp; We also appreciate when our retail partners do the same of us.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our development will be guided by our authors, publishers and retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If we add more value than we earn in commissions, we have a future that is without limit, because the talent, creativity and capability of our authors is without limit.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our authors and publishers are not our customers.&amp;nbsp; They are our partners, our clients.&amp;nbsp; We do not sell them anything, we service them. We will not accept money from them. We will not employ salespeople and we will not sell publishing packages. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We believe the future of publishing is bright because books are important to the future of mankind. As long as writers have a chance to publish, readers will want to read.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are in a relationship with you, the author, publisher, reader and retailer.&amp;nbsp; We will be honest in all our dealings with you.&amp;nbsp; The ebook business is entirely dependent upon trust.&amp;nbsp; When trust is deserved and reciprocated, great things can happen.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will never forget that we serve at the pleasure of our authors, publishers and retailers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to From Here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;Smashwords and the indie community we serve are in the same boat. We've built a great business, but I don't expect the torrid growth to continue.&amp;nbsp; As I predicted in my &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/12/2014-book-publishing-industry.html"&gt;2014 projections&lt;/a&gt;, the ebook market has slowed and sales are likely to be lower this year than last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to starting Smashwords in 2008, I spent almost 20 years doing PR&amp;nbsp; and strategic communications consulting for venture-backed Silicon Valley tech companies. Working in tech, you come to expect cyclical swings of boom and bust followed by boom again.&amp;nbsp; The survivors of the shakeouts emerge stronger and more vibrant than ever.&amp;nbsp; A shakeout is coming, not just for the ebook industry but for authors as well.&amp;nbsp; Things will get tougher from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ebooks never go out of print. There's a glut of high-quality reading material out there.&amp;nbsp; The growth of in the number of ebooks published and forever immortal on digital shelves will probably outpace the growth in reader eyeballs, and therefore the capacity of readers to consume this content.&amp;nbsp; In other words, every one of us will face more competition in the future.&amp;nbsp; The average book in the future will sell fewer copies, not more.&amp;nbsp; The easy days are behind all of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet more books will be read than ever before.&amp;nbsp; The opportunity is there for all of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thrive on challenge.&amp;nbsp; The new business realities don't change how we run the business.&amp;nbsp; It's an environment where author production (the number of titles published each year) and author quality will be the key determinants of success.&amp;nbsp; If you're an author, it's about time management.&amp;nbsp; How will you increase your production, quality, discoverability and desirability?&amp;nbsp; How will you increase your capacity to serve your readers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Smashwords, it's about innovation.&amp;nbsp; We will continue focusing on innovation.&amp;nbsp; We'll build new tools and capabilities that give our authors an advantage in the marketplace.&amp;nbsp; It's not only a business strategy, it's a Darwinian necessity.&amp;nbsp; Every one of us, whether we're a retailer, a distributor, a publisher or an author, must add value to the reader's experience otherwise we fail to live our dream.&amp;nbsp; The spoils will go to those who innovate, adopt and pioneer best practices, and who persevere through the darkest days.&amp;nbsp; If you're an author - even a New York Times bestselling author - you've had those dark days where you wondered if you had the will to carry on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think back to our early days at Smashwords when were were taking in only $1.00 a day yet losing thousands of dollars a month.&amp;nbsp; We kept going because we had this crazy idea that the world &lt;i&gt;needed&lt;/i&gt; a Smashwords.&amp;nbsp; Well, your readers &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; you.&amp;nbsp; Serve them.&amp;nbsp; Your best work is ahead of you if you persevere.&amp;nbsp; I hope you invite Smashwords to join you for the ride!&lt;img src="//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Smashwords/~4/2nIcGUmJMe0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Smashwords/~3/2nIcGUmJMe0/inc-magazine-names-smashwords-to-inc.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Mark Coker)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Iym916LmGoM/U_UkrMpzeOI/AAAAAAAACeU/o893jLvy2Ns/s72-c/incSW122.png" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>25</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/08/inc-magazine-names-smashwords-to-inc.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7436915084701775452.post-9216135786092562078</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2014 20:48:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2014-08-02T17:35:56.099-07:00</atom:updated><title>How to Do Box Sets at Smashwords for Audience Building, Charity and Profit</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0jNHEq2ABKM/U903VhKtv3I/AAAAAAAACd0/rMpVTQetVwg/s1600/finalboxes.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em;

This post will show you how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two most common types of box set are single-author and multi-author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a &lt;b&gt;single-author&lt;/b&gt; box set, an author might combine all the books in a series, or might combine the series starters of multiple series, or might simply combine all their standalone titles into a single collection.&amp;nbsp; Smashwords author Anne Marie Novark, for example, created a single-author &lt;a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/442951"&gt;First in a Series Box Set&lt;/a&gt; featuring four of her full-length romance series starters for the value-price of only $2.99.&amp;nbsp; Smart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a &lt;b&gt;multi-author&lt;/b&gt; box set, multiple authors, usually in the same genre or category, collaborate to publish multiple full-length books or complete short stories in a value-priced bundle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several Smashwords authors have joined together to publish limited-time charity box sets.&amp;nbsp; One recent Smashwords box set, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.smashwords.com/profile/view/ASweetLifeforDiabetes"&gt;A Sweet Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, was orchestrated by author &lt;a href="http://www.brendanovak.com/for-the-cure-2/"&gt;Brenda Novak&lt;/a&gt; and featured fourteen New York Times bestsellers.&amp;nbsp; In one month, the box set earned nearly $30,000 for diabetes research from sales across the Smashwords network, and more from other channels.&amp;nbsp; Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another more recent fundraiser example is &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/454892"&gt;Star Crossed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, orchestrated by author Amy Miles, where thirteen bestselling YA Smashwords fantasy authors - including Amy Miles, Amy A. Bartol, Chanda Hahn, Ella James, Jocelyn Stover, Quinn Loftis, Rebecca Ethington, Shelly Crane, and Wendy Owens - are raising money for a St. Louis-based autism charity. Star Crossed releases August 18 and is available now for preorder at &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/star-crossed-thirteen-book/id897163592?mt=11"&gt;iBooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and will be available soon at &lt;a href="http://www.bn.com/s/2940046058208"&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://store.kobobooks.com/en-us/Search?Query=9781311676092"&gt;Kobo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Box sets are usually value-priced, meaning the box set costs the reader less than purchasing all the books individually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ebook format is uniquely suited to box sets in a way that print is not.&amp;nbsp; The &lt;i&gt;Star Crossed&lt;/i&gt; box set of full-length fantasy novels comprises &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.2 million words&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, a length that in print might span an entire length of a bookshelf.&amp;nbsp; In ebook form, it's a single convenient and lightweight download. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A Closer Look at Multi-Author Box Sets&lt;/h3&gt;Multi-author box sets represent an especially great sales, marketing and audience-building opportunity for authors.&amp;nbsp; For the remainder of this post, I'll focus on multi-author box sets (many of the tips apply to single-author box sets as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magic of a multi-author box set is that each author promotes the box set to their respective fan base.&amp;nbsp; It's a great opportunity for fans of one author to discover similarly great authors in the same genre or category.&amp;nbsp; The audience reach is amplified dramatically via the aggregated promotional effort of all participating authors.&amp;nbsp; If each participating author has thousands of readers subscribed to their private mailing lists, and thousands of fans following them on Twitter and Facebook, you can quickly begin to appreciate the power of amplified collaborative marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's how to set up a multi-author box set at Smashwords:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Choose your collaborators and focus&lt;/b&gt; - Choose collaborators who write for the same target reader you write for.&amp;nbsp; For example, if you write New Adult romance, collaborate with fellow NA romance authors.&amp;nbsp; If you write YA fantasy, collaborate with your favorite YA fantasy authors.&amp;nbsp; Themes are great too.&amp;nbsp; For example, a multi-author box set of Halloween-themed horror novels is a great idea if you write Halloween-themed fiction (get it on preorder now!). Select your collaborators carefully.&amp;nbsp; You're going to recommend this box set and your fellow authors to &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; fans, which means your trusted reputation with your fans is on the line if you partner with authors that won't satisfy your readers. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Work out your business terms&lt;/b&gt; - Decide amongst yourselves who will upload the book, and how you plan to price the book and split the proceeds. Smashwords cannot split the proceeds, so this will be the responsibility of the author or publisher who uploads the box set.&amp;nbsp; Some Smashwords authors doing charity box sets have set up new, standalone Smashwords accounts for the sole purpose of simplifying accounting.&lt;b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create your cover image&lt;/b&gt; - As instructed in the Smashwords Style Guide, Smashwords cannot accept cover images that are pseudo-3d (the cover image is a digital rendition of a three dimensional physical box).&amp;nbsp; The reason is that iBooks will not accept these because they correctly believe that a small number of customers might think they're actually purchasing a physical box set, which they are not.&amp;nbsp; All authors should be listed on the ebook cover image. &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2012/06/new-ebook-cover-image-requirements.html"&gt;Click here to learn more about Smashwords cover requirements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Format with a linked Table of Contents&lt;/b&gt; - You'll combine the multiple books into a single ebook file.&amp;nbsp; Although not a requirement, I recommend that you create a linked Table of Contents for the box set.&amp;nbsp; This way, each author's book can be listed in the table of contents and easily visible in the ebook file's NCX navigation (the NCX is what generates the "Table of Contents" items you see on your iPad, iPhone, Kindle, Nook or other device or e-reading app).&amp;nbsp; It's a good idea to list the books in the ToC as "Book Title by Author Name" without the "quotes" and then underneath each title listing create another link to a section below each author's book labeled "About Author Name" in which you provide a short bio following each author's book.&amp;nbsp; You can also list and link to other author-specific sections, such as "Other books by Author Name" or "Connect with Author Name." To learn how to add navigation to a Smashwords ebook, see Step 20 in the Style Guide, and don't miss my blog post and video, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/11/how-to-add-navigation-to-smashwords.html"&gt;How to Add Navigation to a Smashwords Ebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; You'll find some additional tips in the blog post on box set navigation.&amp;nbsp; If you watch the video you'll learn how incredibly easy it is to upgrade all your Smashwords books with enhanced navigation.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;List the box set as a preorder&lt;/b&gt; - A preorder allows the collaborating  authors to promote the box set to their respective fan bases for weeks  or months in advance of release of the book.&amp;nbsp; Smashwords distributes  preorders to iBooks, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and Kobo, and each retailer  credits all accumulated preoders toward the book's first-day unit sales,  which causes the book to spike in the bestseller lists, which causes  the book to become more visible and more desirable to readers.&amp;nbsp; More  visibility + more desire = more sales!&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://smashwords.com/preorder"&gt;Click here to learn about Smashwords preorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upload&lt;/b&gt; - Once the book is formatted to the Smashwords Style Guide, upload it as you normally would from the Smashwords "Publish" page, and then download the .epub file to confirm the formatting looks great and the navigation works as expected.&amp;nbsp; If you need to make any corrections or updates, click to &lt;i&gt;Dashboard: Upload New Version&lt;/i&gt; to upload the new file.&amp;nbsp; The person who updates the book will be the controlling user. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special tip for the book title&lt;/b&gt; - I think it's a good idea to mention the word "box set" in the book's title, and also the number of contributing authors, and if it's a charity box set mention that as well. Such a title quickly communicates to the browsing reader it's a box set, the theme and why they should care. For example, in the metadata, the title for &lt;a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/454892"&gt;Star Crossed&lt;/a&gt; is listed as &lt;i&gt;Star Crossed (Thirteen-Book Charity Box Set for Autism)&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The title metadata for A Sweet Life was &lt;i&gt;A Sweet Life Boxed Set (Fourteen Contemporary Romances by Bestselling Authors to Benefit Diabetes Research)&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special tips for the book description&lt;/b&gt; - It's a good idea to list all the books and authors in the book description.&amp;nbsp; This will improve discoverability at retailers, and will also help make the book more desirable to readers.&amp;nbsp; Do not mention price in the description.&amp;nbsp; It's okay to mention the bundle is "value-priced," but don't write something like, "A $79.00 value, yours for just $.99!"&amp;nbsp; Prices are never allowed in book descriptions because Smashwords books are distributed to global retailers and sold in multiple currencies.&amp;nbsp; For a customer who purchases in Euros or Yen or Pounds, a USD price is confusing and inaccurate.&amp;nbsp; Anytime you confuse a prospective reader, you create friction, and friction causes them to click away and you lose them.&amp;nbsp; If the box set is raising money for charity, avoid writing in the description, "All proceeds go to charity," because that's not exactly accurate since the retailer is not donating their proceeds.&amp;nbsp; It's more accurate to write, "The authors will donate their proceeds from the sale of this box set to XYZ charity."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Giving multiple authors credit in the "written by" metadata&lt;/b&gt; - Upon upload, the only author credited in the "written by" metadata in the book listing will be the author who uploaded the book. &lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4PaG39V-uJ4/U91CdCx4VdI/AAAAAAAACeE/B_Mrd-7j0aM/s1600/swbox.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4PaG39V-uJ4/U91CdCx4VdI/AAAAAAAACeE/B_Mrd-7j0aM/s1600/swbox.png" height="137" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;That's not good, because you want all the authors credited in the metadata, and retailers want to see all the authors credited on the cover image should also be credited in the metadata as well.&amp;nbsp; To give all authors credit in the metadata, click the "support" link at the bottom of any Smashwords web page to contact our support team.&amp;nbsp; Provide us a direct hyperlink to the author profile page of each contributing author and we'll link them up with the book.&amp;nbsp; If the author doesn't yet have a Smashwords account, please ask them to create one.&amp;nbsp; It's free!&amp;nbsp; Another option:&amp;nbsp; If you've upgraded your account to Publisher status, you can create "ghost" accounts for each contributing author.&amp;nbsp; This option is only recommended for publishers because once you upgrade your account to publisher status, it's a permanent change.&amp;nbsp; Note that we'll link all the authors at Smashwords but our retailers may not be able to link all the names.&amp;nbsp; This is why it's important to place the author names in the book description as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Good luck, and have fun!&lt;img src="//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Smashwords/~4/3VZSK4HjbKk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Smashwords/~3/3VZSK4HjbKk/how-to-do-box-sets-at-smashwords-for.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Mark Coker)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0jNHEq2ABKM/U903VhKtv3I/AAAAAAAACd0/rMpVTQetVwg/s72-c/finalboxes.png" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>10</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/08/how-to-do-box-sets-at-smashwords-for.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7436915084701775452.post-127840460031250854</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2014 21:22:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2014-07-22T19:49:27.357-07:00</atom:updated><title>Is Kindle Unlimited Bad for Authors?</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sycIXh12z5Y/U8lu110VH3I/AAAAAAAACdE/BlevEK3PZeI/s1600/KU.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sycIXh12z5Y/U8lu110VH3I/AAAAAAAACdE/BlevEK3PZeI/s1600/KU.png" height="131" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Amazon today unveiled Kindle Unlimited, following in the footsteps of Smashwords partners Scribd and Oyster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first heard of Kindle Unlimited, I was pleased.&amp;nbsp; After learning more, however, I think indies should steer clear of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long-time readers of this blog know, I was initially &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2012/12/mark-cokers-2013-book-publishing.html"&gt;skeptical&lt;/a&gt; of the prospects for a "Netflix of ebooks," but I began to see the light as I examined the emerging &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/10/examining-business-model-of-ebook.html"&gt;business models of the subscription services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CiDxFOBVqII/U8mW7NbgeuI/AAAAAAAACdU/s8cH5NL8W1A/s1600/swscribdoyster.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CiDxFOBVqII/U8mW7NbgeuI/AAAAAAAACdU/s8cH5NL8W1A/s1600/swscribdoyster.png" height="144" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Now, several months into our relationships with Scribd and Oyster, I'm  pleased to report these two ebook subscription services are the fastest growing retail  channels at Smashwords at a time when industry-wide ebook sales are looking anemic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These services will bring more readers to ebooks and possibly even more readers to conventional ebook retailers (especially if more retailers offer subscription services too). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Scribd and Oyster hit the nail on the head by creating services  that balance the intersecting interests of readers, authors, the  subscription service itself and the publishing industry in which we all operate.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same cannot be said for Kindle Unlimited.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;Indies would do well to avoid Kindle Unlimited for one simple reason:&amp;nbsp; it requires KDP Select exclusivity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been speaking out against KDP Select ever since they launched it in 2011 when I wrote my post, &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2011/12/amazon-shows-predatory-spots-with-kdp.html"&gt;Amazon Shows its Predatory Stripes with KDP Select&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Amazon partisans have accused me of being an Amazon hater for my criticism of KDP Select, but that's simply not true. I admire Amazon.&amp;nbsp; Jeff Bezos and team are freaking brilliant. They deserve massive kudos for catalyzing the rise of ebooks, and for changing the lives of indie authors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for all of Amazon's good deeds, it does not mean we indies should kiss their feet unconditionally. Their business methods are not beyond reproach.&amp;nbsp; We should encourage a healthy debate about Amazon's practices and how they can do better for authors and readers.&amp;nbsp; I can admire Amazon yet still oppose exclusivity.&amp;nbsp; We should also recognize when Amazon's business interests don't align with author interests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KDP Select is a good example where the business interests of Amazon and authors diverge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exclusivity is great for Amazon&lt;/b&gt;, but it's not necessarily great for authors and readers.&amp;nbsp; Exclusivity starves competing retailers of books readers want to read, which motivates readers to move their reading to the Kindle platform. This is why Amazon has made exclusivity central to their ebook strategy. They're playing a long term game of attrition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most indie authors recognize the value in fostering a diverse ecosystem of multiple competing retailing options.&amp;nbsp; Yet every book enrolled in KDP Select is a vote to put Amazon's competitors out of business. You know this to be true if you believe, as I believe, that indies are the future of publishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Authors must weigh the benefits of KDP Select's many enticing features against the alternative benefits of broad and diversified distribution.&amp;nbsp; How do you measure what you'll lose from either decision when missed opportunities are immeasurable?&amp;nbsp; And is it the indie author's responsibility to support Amazon's competitors?&amp;nbsp; Should an indie author feel guilty for giving KDP Select a try?&amp;nbsp; I don't envy authors who must make these decisions.&amp;nbsp; Amazon forces these difficult decisions upon authors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can take years to build readership at a retailer.&amp;nbsp; Authors who cycle their books in and out of KDP Select will have a more  difficult time building readership at Amazon's competitors. Millions of readers prefer shopping at retailers other than Amazon.  These other retailers operate in multiple countries (iBooks, for  example, operates in 51 countries).&amp;nbsp; These country-specific stores  represent unique micro-markets of captive audiences not reachable via  Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any time an author goes exclusive, they risk alienating fans who prefer shopping at other retailers, and they miss the opportunity for serendipitous discovery by new readers at other stores.&amp;nbsp; They risk missing those times where lightning strikes and their books break out at different retailers at different times, often for reasons that can't be identified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Authors who go exclusive at Amazon become more dependent (the opposite of independent) upon Amazon.&amp;nbsp; Just as any financial adviser will advise you to avoid placing your retirement nest egg in a single basket, indies should think twice before locking their books into these three-month, automatically-renewing KDP Select contracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With KDP Select, Amazon rewards authors who go exclusive and disadvantages authors who do not.&amp;nbsp; That's right, they're &lt;i&gt;punishing regular KDP authors&lt;/i&gt; who don't go exclusive by denying them access to special sales and discovery tools like free promotional pricing, Kindle Unlimited and Kindle Owners Lending Library.&amp;nbsp; These are great tools so it's a shame Amazon doesn't make them available to all authors without restriction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is creating a caste system within the Amazon store. Also worthy of note, as revealed by &lt;a href="http://lunch.publishersmarketplace.com/2014/07/kindle-unlimited-officially-launches/"&gt;Publishers Lunch&lt;/a&gt;, it appears as if Amazon is paying traditionally published authors more for their participation in Kindle Unlimited than they're paying indie authors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No other retailer creates such artificial restrictions for indie authors.&amp;nbsp; Smashwords-distributed authors, by contrast, enjoy unlimited free pricing, greater pricing control, ebook preorders, broader global distribution and all without the handcuffs of exclusivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's unfortunate Amazon is restricting access to Kindle Unlimited.&amp;nbsp; It's unfortunate they're denying their customers access to the books of all indie authors who would otherwise participate if not for the exclusivity requirement.&amp;nbsp; It's unfortunate that Amazon forces indies to make such a choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For indie authors who feel trapped in KDP Select, today's announcement offers you a &lt;u&gt;silver lining&lt;/u&gt;:&amp;nbsp; you now have an out.&amp;nbsp; Because Amazon automatically opted all KDP Select authors into Kindle Unlimited, they're giving KDP Select authors the ability to immediately withdraw from KDP Select without waiting for their current three-month term to expire.&amp;nbsp; The instructions, which are listed at &lt;a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=AA9BSAGNO1YJH&amp;amp;ref_=pe_446610_120662130"&gt;https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=AA9BSAGNO1YJH&amp;amp;ref_=pe_446610_120662130&lt;/a&gt; , advise authors to &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/contact-us?topicId=kdpSelect&amp;amp;subtopicId=participation"&gt;contact their support team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to leave KDP Select.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've got indie author friends who are in KDP Select, now might be a good time for them to cast their vote against exclusivity.&amp;nbsp; KDP Select would not exist were it not for the ongoing support of indie authors.&lt;img src="//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Smashwords/~4/IERHW1KNJ6s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Smashwords/~3/IERHW1KNJ6s/is-kindle-unlimited-bad-for-authors.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Mark Coker)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sycIXh12z5Y/U8lu110VH3I/AAAAAAAACdE/BlevEK3PZeI/s72-c/KU.png" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>111</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/07/is-kindle-unlimited-bad-for-authors.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7436915084701775452.post-5461278880840122455</guid><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2014 22:23:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2014-07-07T19:22:35.131-07:00</atom:updated><title>2014 Smashwords Survey Reveals New Opportunities for Indie Authors</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

and &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2012/04/can-ebook-data-reveal-new-viral.html"&gt;2012 Smashwords Survey&lt;/a&gt; here), we examined aggregated retail and library sales data of Smashwords books and then crunched the numbers based on various quantifiable characteristics of the book. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this year's survey, we examined over $25 million in customer purchases&amp;nbsp; aggregated across Smashwords retailers including Apple  iBooks, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, the Smashwords.com store, Sony (now closed), Diesel (closed), Oyster, Scribd, Kobo, public  libraries and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, we break new ground with more data, including survey  questions that explore preorders and series, two categories of inquiry  that weren't possible in prior years.&amp;nbsp; These latter two categories were  enabled by Smashwords' introduction of &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/07/smashwords-introduces-preorder.html"&gt;ebook preorder distribution&lt;/a&gt; in July, 2013 and our new &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/09/new-smashwords-series-manager-improves.html"&gt;Smashwords Series Manager&lt;/a&gt; feature which allows us to capture, analyze and share the performance of series books. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal of the survey is to identify Viral Catalysts.&amp;nbsp; I first introduced the concept of Viral Catalyst in 2012 with the publication of my free ebook best practices book, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/145431"&gt;The Secrets to Ebook Publishing Success&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; A Viral Catalyst is anything that makes a book more discoverable and more enjoyable to readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The underlying premise of my Viral Catalyst concept is that Viral Catalysts help drive reader word of mouth because they increase reader satisfaction.&amp;nbsp; Although every author would love to learn the single secret fast track magic bullet to bestsellerdom, there is no such single secret.&amp;nbsp; Ebook bestsellers become bestsellers based on multiple Viral Catalyst factors starting with book quality but also influenced by cover design, breath of distribution, pricing, marketing, luck and myriad other factors.&amp;nbsp; In the Smashwords Survey, we seek to identify potential Viral Catalysts that are quantifiable and therefore measurable.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial survey results were first revealed at the RT Booklovers convention in New Orleans on May 14, 2014.&amp;nbsp; The updated Slideshare edition of this presentation includes more data, charts and analysis than was presented in New Orleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="356" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/36677950" style="border-width: 1px 1px 0;

&lt;/b&gt; from &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://http//www.slideshare.net/Smashwords/presentations" target="_blank"&gt;Smashwords, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key findings in this year's survey:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The ebook sales power curve is extremely steep&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - This isn't a surprise, but for the first time we share some numbers along the curve (see the slides in the Series section).&amp;nbsp; A few titles sell fabulously well and most sell poorly.&amp;nbsp; An incremental increase is sales rank is usually matched by an exponential increase is sales.&amp;nbsp; Despite the steep sales curve, a lot of Smashwords authors are earning good income from their books.&amp;nbsp; Your opportunity as a Smashwords author or publisher is to do those things that give you an incremental advantage so you can climb in sales rank.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Readers prefer longer ebooks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - We observed this in the prior surveys.&amp;nbsp; Longer books sell better, and when you view the data through the prism of the power curve, it becomes clear why longer books give authors such a huge sales advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Pricing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - The highest earning indie authors are utilizing lower average prices than the authors who earn less, but this doesn't mean that ultra-low prices such as $.99 are the path to riches.&amp;nbsp; $2.99 and $3.99 are the sweet spots for most of the bestsellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;FREE still works great, but it's losing some mojo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - Free remains one of the most powerful book marketing tools because it makes it easier for readers to take a risk on an author brand that is unknown or untrusted.&amp;nbsp; Free ebooks, according to our data derived from iBooks downloads, generated 39 times more downloads on average during our survey period than books at any price.&amp;nbsp; Yet the effectiveness of free is down dramatically compared to our 2013 (91X) and 2012 (100X) survey results.&amp;nbsp; While there is still much untapped greenfield opportunity for indies to leverage free, I expect the effectiveness of free will continue to decline as more authors learn to take advantage of it.&amp;nbsp; If you've never utilized free, now's the time to do so before your window of maximum opportunity closes further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Preorders yield sales advantage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - When we launched preorders in 2013, we knew anecdotally from our early alpha tests that preorders gave authors a sales advantage.&amp;nbsp; The 2014 Survey is the first time we're able to share aggregated results, and the results are strongly suggestive that ebooks borne as preorders sell more copies and earn the author more money than books that don't utilized preorders.&amp;nbsp; I think preorders today are where free was five years ago.&amp;nbsp; The first authors to effectively utilize preorders will gain the most advantage, just as the first authors to enter new distribution channels gain the most advantage.&amp;nbsp; Five years from now once all indies recognize that preorders are a no-brainer essential best practice, the effectiveness of preorders will decline.&amp;nbsp; Also revealed in the data is the fact that most Smashwords authors (and therefore, most indies) ARE NOT utilizing preorders yet despite our aggressive promotion of this exciting new tool.&amp;nbsp; The authors who heeded our advice, however, are reaping the rewards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Series yield sales advantage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - For the first time, we examine the performance of series books.&amp;nbsp; This new analysis is enabled by the fact that in September we launched Smashwords Series Manager which allows us to capture enhanced metadata on series.&amp;nbsp; The results are interesting!&amp;nbsp; Series books outsell standalone books.&amp;nbsp; We also look at the characteristics of series.&amp;nbsp; I'll want to do more with series in our 2015 survey.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Best-performing series have longer books&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - Not a surprise, but the implications are significant.&amp;nbsp; If you imagine the power curve overlaid on the series data we share, you see why authors who write full-length books in their series have an advantage over authors who break books into smaller chunks.&amp;nbsp; Also interesting, we found series books under 50,000 words are especially disadvantaged.&amp;nbsp; This is not to say that you can't become a bestseller writing shorter novellas.&amp;nbsp; Multiple Smashwords authors have had success here.&amp;nbsp; But what the data does tell me is that successful novella writers might achieve even &lt;i&gt;greater&lt;/i&gt; success if they write full-length.&amp;nbsp; The data appears to suggest that series books under 50,000 words might create friction that makes readers incrementally less willing to buy.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;FREE series starters pack a punch&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - This is a big deal.&amp;nbsp; I suspected this for a long time based on numerous authors' results going back to &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2010/12/smashwords-author-brian-s-pratt-to-earn.html"&gt;Brian S. Pratt&lt;/a&gt; who was one of the first Smashwords authors to prove the effectiveness of free series starters, but the aggregated numbers now confirm it.&amp;nbsp; We found strong evidence that series that have free series starters earn more money for authors than series that do not have free series starters.&amp;nbsp; For the many Smashwords authors who are reluctant to experiment with free for fear it'll devalue your books, now you've got the kick in the butt you need to give it a try.&amp;nbsp; All Smashwords retailers support free without restriction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;New (added July 7)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Non-fiction earns more at higher prices&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; -&amp;nbsp; For the first time we added new data for non-fiction pricing.&amp;nbsp; We looked at the most common price points for indie non-fiction, the price points that earn the most downloads, and the price points that earn the non-fiction author the most money.&amp;nbsp; The results are fascinating.&amp;nbsp; It's not a surprise that non-fiction readers respond differently to price.&amp;nbsp; The surprise is how differently.&amp;nbsp; Non-fiction buyers are less price-sensitive.&amp;nbsp; After crunching the numbers it appears as if most non-fiction authors are under-pricing their works, and they should experiment with higher prices.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to Interpret the Findings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For many of the slides, I added analysis to help you interpret the findings.&amp;nbsp; This analysis is my own interpretation.&amp;nbsp; You may view the findings differently, or see things I don't see.&amp;nbsp; Or you may strongly disagree with my interpretation.&amp;nbsp; That's okay. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be cautious.&amp;nbsp; Most of the survey results are based on averages.&amp;nbsp; Your book is not average.&amp;nbsp; It's unique.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, your results will vary.&amp;nbsp; The findings aggregate the results of many dissimilar books, which means the findings are prone to misinterpretation and error.&amp;nbsp; The findings are also potentially skewed by factors such as genre (romance dominates, which means our data will more closely describe potential outcomes for romance or genre fiction than it will for non-fiction how-to manuals), or by the fact book sales at retailers are heavily skewed to fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I caution on Slide 25, cause and effect is not always provable.&amp;nbsp; The forces that determine a book's sales performance are often multi-dimensional, synergistic, opaque, delayed or simply not apparent.&amp;nbsp; Correlation does not always mean causation.&amp;nbsp; For example, although we show that the highest-earning books were priced at $3.99, the price alone is not the reason those books were bestsellers, and you should not necessarily jump to change all your prices to $3.99.&amp;nbsp; Although the bestselling books tend to be over 100,000 words, readers don't purchase by length alone, so don't write longer if the story doesn't demand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider our findings as possible inputs that influence the outcome.&amp;nbsp; Do not make publishing decisions solely based on the findings in this survey.&amp;nbsp; Instead, use these findings as an additional datapoint - as potential clues - that will help you make more informed decisions.&amp;nbsp; Also note the findings will raise additional questions.&amp;nbsp; As I was digging through the data for preorders, for example, I found myself wanting to dive deeper to explore such questions as, &lt;i&gt;do sales decay over time&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;how do new releases impact the sales of existing series books&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;how is the sales behavior across different genres different&lt;/i&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Although this survey shares more data than ever before, I found that the more questions I asked, the more I wanted to ask.&amp;nbsp; There simply wasn't time to build all the queries I wanted, or time to crunch and analyze all the numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to sharing more in 2015 if not earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found the survey results useful, won't you please share with your writer friends?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Noble, Kobo, OverDrive and the Smashwords store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reports include daily and total order accumulation numbers for iBooks preorders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reports provide authors and publishers unprecedented insight into recent sales performance across the largest Smashwords retailers.&amp;nbsp; Authors can use the reports to gain rapid feedback on the effectiveness of marketing and promotion campaigns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can view your aggregated performance over the  prior seven day or 30 day period, with drill-down views by retailer, title or  series.&amp;nbsp; There are also one-click filters to view priced  books, free books, all books and accumulated preorders (iBooks only).&amp;nbsp; Publishers and literary agents who manage multiple authors can drill down and view author-specific  performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to compare the performance of two or three series across different retailers, you can do it.&amp;nbsp; If you want to measure the impact of a blog tour, an advertisement, a price change, a new cover image, a new release in a series or a new free series starter or anything else, the results are now at your fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each chart is also accompanied by a table that shows how the recent 7- or 30-day period compares to the prior 7- or 30-day period. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reports are updated same-day daily &lt;b&gt;every three hours&lt;/b&gt; for Barnes &amp;amp; Noble; next-day daily for iBooks and Kobo; and same-day daily every 30 minutes for the Smashwords store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sales data can be downloaded as a spreadsheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find the new charts in your Dashboard via the &lt;b&gt;Daily Sales&lt;/b&gt;

We'll continue to add more retailers to the daily charts as retailers make their data available to us.&amp;nbsp; Also, in the months ahead as we begin archiving more daily trending data, and we'll  add options for longer analysis periods such as 60 days, 90 days and longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consolidate Your Distribution with Smashwords &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're uploading direct to any of our major retailers such as Barnes &amp;amp;

iBooks will come pre-installed on iOS 8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iBooks app is Apple's ebook store.&amp;nbsp; Inside that app are over 250,000 books from Smashwords authors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a game-changer for ebook retailing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;

It means only a fraction of Apple's customer base today has convenient access to your books (which makes the enormous success of iBooks all the more impressive).&amp;nbsp; Yesterday's news means iBooks will become ubiquitous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

It's not a stretch to speculate that within a couple years, the iBooks app will be ever-present on over &lt;b&gt;one billion devices&lt;/b&gt; around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apple's brilliant move will place your books just one or two clicks from being discovered by readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can you make the most of this new development?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make sure all your books are at iBooks ASAP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.&amp;nbsp; As we &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/05/smashwords-introduces-faster-deliveries.html"&gt;announced May 18&lt;/a&gt;, Smashwords now delivering ebooks to iBooks five times daily, seven days per week, and many of our books and preorder listings are going live in the store within hours of us delivering them.&amp;nbsp; If your books are locked in the dungeon of exclusivity elsewhere, release them today on Smashwords!&amp;nbsp; If you're not yet on Smashwords, &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.smashwords.com/about/how_to_publish_on_smashwords"&gt;click here to get started today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Promote direct hyperlinks to iBooks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Make sure that on your blog, website and in all your social media promotions that you're providing a direct hyperlink to your books at iBooks.&amp;nbsp; With a direct hyperlink, your book page will open directly within the reader's iOS device, and with another click they can purchase it.&amp;nbsp; Use Apple's &lt;a href="https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/"&gt;Link Maker&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://widgets.itunes.apple.com/builder/"&gt;Widget Builder&lt;/a&gt; tools to find links or create attractive widgets that point directly to your book at iBooks.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Link your series with Smashwords Series Manager&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.&amp;nbsp; If you write series, make sure your books are linked with &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/09/new-smashwords-series-manager-improves.html"&gt;Smashwords' Series Manager&lt;/a&gt; tool, which you'll find in your Smashwords Dashboard.&amp;nbsp; We pass this enhanced metadata on to iBooks, and they use it to make series books more discoverable.&amp;nbsp; Also referenced in fine print on the slide above is a mention of enhanced series listings in iBooks for iOS 8, which means we can expect the Series Manager metadata to become more important than ever to iBooks merchandising and reader discovery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Congrats Smashwords authors!&lt;img src="//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Smashwords/~4/IZ5jwbatMIk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Smashwords/~3/IZ5jwbatMIk/apples-new-ios-8-is-game-changer-for.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Mark Coker)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GhIBOzqOL3U/U43uJhMhgzI/AAAAAAAACbE/PzdsexRq1mU/s72-c/apple+desktop_ios8_icon.png" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>30</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/06/apples-new-ios-8-is-game-changer-for.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7436915084701775452.post-618425942863865992</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2014 23:51:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2014-05-26T16:51:49.953-07:00</atom:updated><title>Amazon's Hachette Dispute Foreshadows What's Next for Indie Authors</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Hachette earns over 1/3 of its &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303749904579580052135901452?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection&amp;amp;mg=reno64-wsj"&gt;US sales&lt;/a&gt; from ebooks.&amp;nbsp; Hachette wants agency terms for its books.&amp;nbsp; Hachette wants to control the list price of its books and earn 70% list from each sale.&amp;nbsp; Smashwords &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2010/11/smashwords-puts-authors-and-publishers.html"&gt;announced agency terms&lt;/a&gt; with our retail partners in 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other side is Amazon, a fierce opponent to agency pricing.&amp;nbsp; Amazon wants the ability to discount books, and to enable greater discounting Amazon wants a larger percentage of the publisher's pie.&amp;nbsp; A story out Friday by Jeffrey Trachtenburg of the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303749904579580052135901452?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection&amp;amp;mg=reno64-wsj"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; confirms Amazon is seeking to reduce the percentage paid to publishers.&amp;nbsp; Amazon is seeking to weaken or abolish the agency model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also the view of Andrew Albanese of Publishers Weekly, who in his March 16 story, &lt;a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/retailing/article/62349-will-the-agency-model-survive.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Will the Agency Model Survive?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; speculated that the future of agency hangs in the balance.&amp;nbsp; As Albanese writes in his piece, the timing of the Amazon/Hachette dispute is not coincidental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;One likely reason (for the current timing of the dispute) is that when the publishers' 2012 &lt;a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/53870-federal-judge-approves-settlement-in-doj-e-book-case.html"&gt;consent decrees&lt;/a&gt; in the e-book price-fixing case begin to expire this fall, so too will Amazon’s ability to discount e-books. The parties don't comment on specific negotiations (and neither Hachette or Amazon will comment directly on the current dispute or ongoing talks). But it is fair to say that Amazon officials likely see the current negotiations as their best chance to push for the end of agency pricing for e-books, and are apparently prepared to bring to bear all the pressure they can on publishers—whether on the Kindle side, or print. The question is, will the major publishers stick together to keep agency pricing for e-books?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The dispute is generating some spectacular fireworks.&amp;nbsp; It's also &lt;a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/bits/2014/05/23/amazons-tactics-confirm-its-critics-worst-suspicions/"&gt;confirming the suspicions of Amazon's worst critics&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; In an attempt to force Hachette to capitulate, Amazon is employing a shock and awe campaign of scorched earth retribution  against Hachette.&amp;nbsp; According to  multiple &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/10/technology/writers-feel-an-amazon-hachette-spat.html?"&gt;press reports&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon has increased Hachette's book prices to  its customers then turned its automated merchandising algorithms into attack dogs that encourage customers to consider "&lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/05/23/amazon-escalates-standoff-with-publisher-hachette/9507621/"&gt;similar items at a lower price&lt;/a&gt;"; Amazon is  telling customers Hachette print books are out of stock; and is denying  Hachette the ability to list preorders.&amp;nbsp; For a company that prides  itself in customer service, these are all customer-unfriendly  moves.&amp;nbsp; These actions also punish Hachette authors,  who through no fault of their own will suffer reduced sales at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last  four years, indie ebook authors have endured similar iron-fisted policy enforcement and lost earnings with Amazon's KDP price-matching, even when  Amazon knew the out-of-sync ebook prices were not the author's intention or fault.&amp;nbsp; Amazon  plays business like war.&amp;nbsp; Overwhelming force pushes weak hands to surrender and comply.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a letter written to Amazon by the Association of Author's Representatives (AAR), a trade group representing literary agents, AAR likened Amazon's tactics to hostage-taking and extortion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon defenders (and critics too) and will say &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;business is business&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, and if you want to  play in the Amazon sandbox - the world's largest ebook store - you have  to play by their rules.&amp;nbsp; The Amazon defenders are correct.&amp;nbsp; Amazon is  under no obligation to carry Hachette's books under the terms Hachette  wants. Amazon is under no obligation to play nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The industry can cry until it's blue in the face about how Amazon is ruthless and heavy-handed, and how other retailers are kinder and gentler. The truth of the argument doesn't change the reality.&amp;nbsp; Amazon does what it does because it can, because authors and publishers let them do it, and because it's in Amazon's nature to act this way.&amp;nbsp; Lions eat wildebeest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For its part, Hachette is sending letters to agents and authors asking for their patience and support.&amp;nbsp; In their May 23 letter, Hachette wrote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please know that we are doing everything in our power to find a solution to this difficult situation, one that best serves our authors and their work, and that preserves our ability to survive and thrive as a strong and author-centric publishing company.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is playing a game of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule"&gt;divide and conquer&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Amazon  knows if they weaken or cancel their agency agreement with Hachette  that the  other publishers will have less leverage to hold the line on agency.&amp;nbsp;  And whatever concessions Amazon gets, other retailers will want the same,  further undermining the ability of publishers to control their prices or  maintain their profits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon's tactics hit Hachette in two places where it hurts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author confidence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; - The dispute will undermine literary agent and author confidence that Hachette can deliver books to Amazon.&amp;nbsp; This will cause some agents and authors to think twice before selling upcoming projects to Hachette.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Profitability&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - Amazon knows that if they if they can make Hachette the first domino to fall in their anti-agency crusade, it's more likely to force other publishers to abandon it as well.&amp;nbsp; Once agency is eliminated, ebooks will become less profitable to publishers, which then marginalizes publishers by weakening their strategic power in the marketplace.&amp;nbsp; With lower margins, publishers will have less flexibility to increase ebook royalty rates to authors at at time when their authors are clamoring for higher royalties.&amp;nbsp; This would thereby compel more authors to self-publish directly with Amazon, which benefits Amazon.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Publishers  deserve much of the blame for making their ebook margins such an appetizing target for Amazon.&amp;nbsp; Amazon's assault on their margins should come as no surprise.&amp;nbsp; In 2012, Adam Lashinsky of Fortune Magazine wrote that a favorite Jeff Bezos aphorism is "&lt;a href="http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/11/16/jeff-bezos-amazon/"&gt;Your margin is my opportunity&lt;/a&gt;."&amp;nbsp; Publishers have been complaining about Amazon for years yet still supplied them the books that created Amazon.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Publishers have been reporting healthy earnings in recent months,  driven in large part by high-margin ebook sales.&amp;nbsp; Publishers pay authors  only 25% of net ebook proceeds, whereas indie authors earn 85-100% of  net proceeds.&amp;nbsp; In other words, publishers made themselves a target for a  company whose  very DNA is programmed to strip suppliers (publishers) of  their margin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a PR perspective, Amazon can cast their move as taking from the  greedy publishers to provide customers lower prices.&amp;nbsp; But in the end,  they're really taking from authors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hachette faces a dilemma.&amp;nbsp; They face the lose/lose decision of  either giving that margin to Amazon, or choosing to kiss its Amazon  relationship goodbye.&amp;nbsp; It would be painful for publishers to say goodbye to Amazon.&amp;nbsp; Amazon controls approximately &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/09/technology/hachette-says-amazon-is-delaying-delivery-of-some-books.html?_r=0"&gt;1/3 of the overall trade book market&lt;/a&gt; in the US, and up to 50-60% of the ebook market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2010, publishers presented Amazon with a unified front by simultaneously demanding agency pricing terms.&amp;nbsp; This forced Amazon to capituate and accept agency pricing.&amp;nbsp; It was a different world back then. Amazon's nascent Kindle ebook business needed the books of big publishers.&amp;nbsp; The bitter aftertaste has never left Amazon's mouth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The publishers viewed agency as a better model.&amp;nbsp; The &lt;a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/58635-publishers-object-to-doj-s-proposed-apple-injunction.html"&gt;US DoJ&lt;/a&gt; viewed the united front as collusion.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2014, publishers are more disposable to Amazon than they once were, thanks in part to the rise of indie authorship, and thanks also to better business diversification.&amp;nbsp; Amazon's business is no longer as dependent upon books as it once was.&amp;nbsp; They sell everything under the sun, from diapers to shoes to cloud services to groceries to media devices. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Books represent only one of hundreds of layers of icing on the cake of Amazon.&amp;nbsp; Amazon can lose money on books while still operating a profitable business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure-play book retailers - Kobo and Barnes &amp;amp; Noble for example, must  earn money from book sales.&amp;nbsp; Unlike Amazon, they don't have the financial resources to sell books at a loss forever.&amp;nbsp; Publishers must also earn money from book sales, otherwise they can't keep the lights on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Amazon can abolish agency pricing it will have the power to put its largest pure-play book retailing competitors out of business.&amp;nbsp; This will make the publishers even more dependent upon Amazon, which further weakens their power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How  can Hachette get out of this mess?&amp;nbsp; None of its options are good.&amp;nbsp; Amazon holds the strongest hand in this high-stakes poker match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  boldest option is for Hachette to play the nuclear card: they can withdraw all their books from Amazon.&amp;nbsp; Hachette could direct readers to more publisher-friendly platforms and stores.&amp;nbsp; Hachette could also make a more concerted effort to develop new channels of distribution.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Curiously, neither Hachette nor any other major NY publisher has ever attempted to sell their books in the Smashwords ebook store, despite the fact that Smashwords pays up to 80% list.&amp;nbsp; Publisher insistence on DRM is one of several factors that has locked them into Amazon and locked them out of new outlets.&amp;nbsp; Most of the publishers are also refusing to work with the new ebook subscription services, or have treated libraries as second-class citizens, even though these two channels provide yet another healthy counterbalance to a single retailer's dominance.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's uncertain if Hachette or other publishers could survive if they abandon Amazon.&amp;nbsp; Would authors and  literary agents continue to support them if their books didn't reach  Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The window of opportunity for such a bold move is closing quickly.&amp;nbsp; Within the next several years, ebooks as a percentage of the overall book market will increase as print declines.&amp;nbsp; Within a few years, Amazon's sales of indie-supplied ebooks will probably exceed sales of  publisher-supplied books.&amp;nbsp; This means the leverage publishers hold over  Amazon will diminish each year.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other alternative is for Hachette to capitulate to Amazon, which  is akin to Hachette accepting a long term death sentence.&amp;nbsp; Amazon views  publishers as unnecessary intermediaries.&amp;nbsp; Amazon  works to disintermediate the intermediaries so it can control the relationship with the creators (authors) and the  customers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other Big 5 publishers might do well to play their nuclear cards before it's too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the big publishers capitulate and abandon agency, the other retailers, in order to remain competitive, will be forced to abandon their agency agreements with the publishers as well, otherwise Amazon would have the ability to underprice them. And then the pure-play book retailers would fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are Indie Authors Next in the Crosshairs?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispute with Hachette foreshadows what comes next for indie ebook authors at Amazon who have grown comfortable to KDP's 70% royalty rates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about my divide and conquer reference above.&amp;nbsp; Indies are already divided and conquered at Amazon, but most don't realize this.&amp;nbsp; These indies all have direct-upload relationships with Amazon.&amp;nbsp; They  don't have the collective bargaining power of a large publisher to advocate on their  behalf.&amp;nbsp; As the unfolding events indicate, it's questionable if even a large publisher has leverage over Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Hachette doesn't have the power to maintain 70% earnings, how will million-copy-selling New York Times bestselling indie authors have any power when Amazon decides to put the squeeze on them? &amp;nbsp; And how about the rest of the indie community which has even less leverage over Amazon? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long until Amazon puts on the squeeze?&amp;nbsp; The squeeze  may already have started.&amp;nbsp; In February, Amazon gutted the royalty rates they pay for audiobooks, as Laura Hazard Owen reported at GigaOm in her  story, &lt;a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/02/27/amazon-owned-audible-lowers-royalty-rates-on-self-published-audiobooks/"&gt;Amazon-owned Audible lowers royalty rates on self-published audiobooks&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;  Previously, authors earned up to 90% list.&amp;nbsp; Under the new terms, authors  earn from 25% to 40% list. Amazon can do this because they  dominate audiobooks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any time, Amazon could choose to eliminate the 70% royalty option at KDP.&amp;nbsp; They could offer the same terms as their Audible division: 25% list if you're non-exclusive, and 40% list if you're exclusive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Amazon tightens the screws, indies will face the same painful decision Hachette now faces.&amp;nbsp; Either swallow the bitter pill, or remove your books from Amazon. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most indies would probably choose to accept lower royalties at Amazon under the logic that something is better than nothing. As individuals, indies have little leverage against Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most vulnerable to any change in policy at Amazon are the indie  authors who supply approximately 500,000 ebooks to Amazon's KDP Select  program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advice to Indie Authors: Four Steps to Improve your Independence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it really necessary that retailers and publishers should view one another as war-like adversaries, or as predator and prey?&amp;nbsp; I don't think so.&amp;nbsp; At Smashwords, we serve our authors by serving our retailers.&amp;nbsp; We help our retail partners efficiently receive, ingest and sell our authors' books.&amp;nbsp; By opening up new retail and library channels, we support our authors.&amp;nbsp; We think our new channels help our retailers too, because each new channel we open is a reminder that exclusivity is bad for publishing.&amp;nbsp; What leverage we do have we apply to negotiating fair and equitable agreements that are win/wins for our authors and retailers. We want our retail partners to profit from our books, because if they don't profit it's not a long-term sustainable relationship.&amp;nbsp; We believe the 70/30 agency split provides retailers a fair profit.&amp;nbsp; I've always believed that partnership and cooperation are preferable to war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an indie author, it's important you understand that you're the future of publishing.&amp;nbsp; Your choices matter.&amp;nbsp; Your decisions will shape not only your future but the future for all indies.&amp;nbsp; Your decisions will shape how retailers treat you.&amp;nbsp; Independence is earned - it's not something you can take for granted.&amp;nbsp; Here are four tips to preserve your independence:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Choose your partners carefully&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; In the &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/04/indie-author-manifesto.html"&gt;Indie Author Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; I wrote that indie authors should seek business relationships marked by partnership, fairness, equity and mutually aligned interests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Favor retail partners that support the agency model&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Agency puts  authors and publishers in control and frees retailers to compete  against one another based on customer experience rather than cut-throat  price wars.&amp;nbsp; The agency model &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;enables lower customer prices &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;because more of the money goes to the author/publisher rather than the retailer.&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Indies have used agency to &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2012/03/does-agency-pricing-lead-to-higher-book.html"&gt;lower ebooks prices&lt;/a&gt; while publishers made the mistake of using agency to raise prices.&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Agency  establishes a framework by which authors and retailers can work in  partnership rather than as predator and prey. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid exclusivity&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Exclusivity makes you dependent upon a single retailer.&amp;nbsp; Work for independence, the opposite of dependence.&amp;nbsp; Diversify your income stream by distributing everywhere.&amp;nbsp; Every retailer reaches new readers you otherwise won't reach.&amp;nbsp; Each retailer, and each store they operate in each country, represents it's own unique micro-market of readers.&amp;nbsp; It can take years to develop readership, so maintain a strong and steady course of uninterrupted full distribution.&amp;nbsp; This is &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2011/12/amazon-shows-predatory-spots-with-kdp.html"&gt;similar advice I gave gave in 2011&lt;/a&gt; when I cautioned authors to steer clear of Amazon's KDP Select option.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Support a vibrant ecosystem of multiple competing retailers&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; On  your website and in your promotions, provide direct links to your books  at each retail partner.&amp;nbsp; Give your fans choice.&amp;nbsp; Choice makes your books more accessible to readers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Good luck!&lt;img src="//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Smashwords/~4/954y7w6q0pc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Smashwords/~3/954y7w6q0pc/amazons-hachette-dispute-foreshadows.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Mark Coker)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1KNcdi_rPoU/U4PHw9fFXZI/AAAAAAAACa0/LAzpDltoY4Q/s72-c/amazonVShachette.png" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>51</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/05/amazons-hachette-dispute-foreshadows.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7436915084701775452.post-6687780132205224094</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2014 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2014-06-03T08:04:57.037-07:00</atom:updated><title>Smashwords and OverDrive to Bring 200,000+ Indie Ebooks to 20,000+ Public Libraries</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Now imagine no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smashwords today announced an agreement to supply more than 200,000 titles to OverDrive, the world’s largest library ebook platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OverDrive powers the ebook procurement and checkout systems for 20,000 public libraries around the world, including 90% of US public libraries.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This agreement marks a watershed moment for indie authors, libraries and library patrons around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s also a big deal for thousands of small independent presses around the globe who now have a convenient onramp into the OverDrive network.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Millions of library patrons will now have access to the amazing diversity and quality of the Smashwords catalog.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a time when many large publishers are charging libraries high prices for ebooks (front list ebooks from Big 5 publishers can cost libraries $80, and even backlist ebooks can cost libraries $20-40), Smashwords authors and publishers are stepping in to supply thousands of affordably priced, library-friendly ebooks.&amp;nbsp; Faced with the option of purchasing a single James Patterson novel for around $40.00, or ten thrillers from today’s most popular indie authors at $4.00 each, libraries now have exciting new options to build patron-pleasing ebook collections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help librarians streamline collection development, in the weeks ahead OverDrive and Smashwords will create curated buy-lists lists libraries can use to purchase the most popular indie authors and titles. Libraries will soon have the option, for example, to purchase the top 100 YA fantasy novels (approximate price: ~$400), or the top 1,000 most popular contemporary romances (~$4,000) or top 200 complete series across multiple categories (~$2,000), or the top 200 thrillers, mysteries, epic fantasies or memoirs.&amp;nbsp; With most of our bestsellers priced priced at or under $4.00, you can do the math to appreciate how incredibly affordable these collections will be.&amp;nbsp; We’re going to have fun slicing and dicing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our lists will measure title popularity by aggregating sales data from across the Smashwords distribution network.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Indie authors:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; If you needed yet another reason to fully distribute all your titles to all retailers via the Smashwords distribution network, now you have it.&amp;nbsp; Stand up and have your sales counted because we want to help libraries purchase the greatest diversity of high-quality ebooks across multiple genres and categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a couple additional stats to help you appreciate the massive scale of the OverDrive network:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Library patrons borrowed more than &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;102 million digital titles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; across the OverDrive network in 2013, up 44% over 2012.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OverDrive delivered over &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;1.8 billion cover image impressions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to library patrons in 2013, up almost 70% from 2012.&amp;nbsp; This gives authors incredible exposure and branding to readers searching for their next read.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Per our agreement with OverDrive, libraries will lend purchased ebooks under the one copy/one user model, meaning each copy they purchase can be checked to only one reader at a time.&amp;nbsp; This is the same licensing arrangement we use for books we distribute via &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2012/03/smashwords-to-distribute-to-blio-and.html"&gt;Baker &amp;amp; Taylor's Axis 360&lt;/a&gt; service which we launched two years ago.&amp;nbsp; Once a patron’s borrowing time expires, the book is ready to be checked out by another patron.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Library patrons at OverDrive are able to recommend titles to their library from the Smashwords catalog, which will help libraries round out their collections. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternately, if a library ebook is already checked out, patrons will be presented with the option to purchase the ebook through a link on participating libraries’ websites through OverDrive’s “Buy It Now” feature. In this sense, the OverDrive library network becomes an ebook retailer for popular books.&amp;nbsp; The library also earns a commission in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Libraries are engines of book discovery.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; Libraries buy ebooks.&amp;nbsp; Library patrons buy ebooks.&amp;nbsp; According to a &lt;a href="http://libraries.pewinternet.org/2012/06/22/libraries-patrons-and-e-books/"&gt;Pew research study&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, 41% of library cardholders who read ebooks purchased their most recently read ebook.&amp;nbsp; Indie authors who distribute to libraries will not only sell books to libraries, but they’ll also sell more books at retail as their readership grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smashwords distributes many of the world’s bestselling indie authors, including numerous New York Times and USA Today bestsellers. Among the many bestselling Smashwords authors available to OverDrive libraries are Amy Miles, Brian S. Pratt, Chanda Hahn (Chanda is a former librarian!&amp;nbsp; Read &lt;a href="http://chandahahn.com/blog/about-me/"&gt;her story here&lt;/a&gt;), Colleen Hoover, GJ Walker-Smith, Jamie McGuire, JD Nixon, Kirsty Moseley, Kristen Ashley, Lauren Blakely, Melody Grace, Natasha Preston, Quinn Loftis, R.L. Mathewson, Randolph Lalonde, Shayne Parkinson and T.C. Southwell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full Smashwords Premium Catalog of non-erotica titles is eligible for the distribution to OverDrive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smashwords authors and publishers can set custom library prices through the Smashwords Dashboard’s &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2012/08/smashwords-pricing-manager-tool-enables.html"&gt;Pricing Manager&lt;/a&gt; feature.&amp;nbsp; Many Smashwords authors, in a show of support for public libraries, setting lower-than-retail prices for libraries.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smashwords authors will earn 45% of the library list price they set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OverDrive does not support prices under $1.99 due to per-checkout transaction fees OverDrive must pay to their DRM vendor.&amp;nbsp; Therefore Smashwords books priced under $1.99 – including FREE titles – will be priced at $1.99 at OverDrive.&amp;nbsp; Even at $1.99, this low price represents a tremendous value for libraries that are accustomed to paying 20-40 times more for a single title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OverDrive has already completed ingestion of the first 100,000 Smashwords ebooks.&amp;nbsp; Books will become purchasable by Overdrive libraries as early as this Friday or next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All non-erotica Premium Catalog books are automatically opted in to OverDrive distribution.&amp;nbsp; If any Smashwords authors or publishers wish to opt out of OverDrive distribution (not recommended!), they should do so via their Dashboard's &lt;a href="https://www.smashwords.com/dashboard/channelManager"&gt;Channel Manager&lt;/a&gt; feature before Thursday end of day to prevent titles from appearing for sale at OverDrive.&amp;nbsp; Of course, authors and publishers have the freedom to opt out at any time.&amp;nbsp; Later today I’ll send an email to all Smashwords authors and publishers notifying them about this exciting new distribution opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I anticipate OverDrive will complete loading the remaining 100,000+ titles to over the next 4-8 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Smashwords Authors, Here’s What you Can Do to Support Your Local Libraries&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distribute your full list of titles to OverDrive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let your fans know that your books will soon be purchasable by 20,000 libraries around the world (remember, erotica is not distributed to OverDrive). Encourage your fans to contact their local library and ask them to order your books!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the next few weeks, make a point to visit your local library and introduce yourself.&amp;nbsp; Let them know you’re a local author, and your books will soon be available on OverDrive (please keep in mind that it'll still be several weeks before OverDrive completes the ingestion of our massive catalog so it's possible not all of your titles are immediately available). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offer to hold a book reading event at your library.&amp;nbsp; Or better yet, partner with other local Smashwords authors to collaborate on a multi-author reading event.&amp;nbsp; If your author friends are not yet distributing via Smashwords, show them how.&amp;nbsp; Here's a link to my videos on YouTube that will help them learn to publish like a pro at Smashwords - &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/user/Smashwords"&gt;http://youtube.com/user/Smashwords&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offer to present a free workshop at your library on how to professionally self-publish an ebook.&amp;nbsp; Be sure to promote your workshop to local media and event calendar listings.&amp;nbsp; Help mentor the next generation of library-friendly authors and have fun in the process!&amp;nbsp; You’re welcome to take my Powerpoint presentations and customize them for your own purposes.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Smashwords/ebook-publishing-in-the-classroom"&gt;Here’s a link&lt;/a&gt; to the two presentations I gave at the Los Gatos High School, in partnership with the Los Gatos Library, educating the students about ebook publishing for their amazing &lt;a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/431588"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Windows to the Teenage Soul&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project (a great example of how libraries can partner with local schools to promote a culture of authorship).&amp;nbsp; The project has received nationwide press attention (see the story that came out yesterday in &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slj.com/2014/05/books-media/publishing/california-town-librarian-leads-project-for-high-schoolers-to-publish-e-book/"&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; or see my write-up &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/05/ebook-publishing-in-classroom-los-gatos.html"&gt;here at the Smashwords blog&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many libraries face constant budget pressures.&amp;nbsp; The work they do is important!&amp;nbsp; Partner with your fellow authors to support your local library.&amp;nbsp; If you're a member of a writing or critique group, support your library as a group.&amp;nbsp; Offer to hold book launch parties at the library once they have a copy of your ebook in their OverDrive collection.&amp;nbsp; Ask your local librarian what you and your fellow indies can do to support their good work.&amp;nbsp; Maybe a library fund raiser?&amp;nbsp; Contact your local city's mayor and state political representatives and tell them how vitally important your local library is to your community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Librarians, Here’s How You Can Support the Indie Author Community&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;If you’re on OverDrive, check out our books!&amp;nbsp; Talk with your OverDrive rep.&amp;nbsp; We'll be building recommended buy-lists in the coming weeks, so let us know your wishlists for categories and list sizes (or leave suggestions below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;Promote indie authorship in your community.&amp;nbsp; This is your chance to support the next generation of library-friendly authors.&amp;nbsp; Libraries have always done a fantastic job promoting literacy and a culture of books.&amp;nbsp; Now's your chance to promote a culture of authorship.

and through e-reading apps for iOS, Android, the Mac and Windows 8. txtr also powers the ebook store for UK-based retailer Foyles and powers the stores of two Eastern European mobile network operators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;txtr is currently developing txtr-powered ebook stores for US-based mass merchant retailers though the details of these relationships have not been announced yet. Once txtr is ready to announce these or other exciting developments, I’ll share with Smashwords authors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over 250,000 Smashwords titles – which come from many of the world’s bestselling indie authors – will bring txtr’s ebook catalog to over 1.7 million titles.&amp;nbsp; Smashwords titles join titles from most of the major New York publishers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The addition of txtr marks an ongoing global expansion of the &lt;a href="https://www.smashwords.com/about/how_to_publish_on_smashwords"&gt;Smashwords retail distribution network&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Smashwords authors can upload one book to Smashwords and have it distributed within hours or days to a growing number of retail and library sales outlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;txtr will retail Smashwords books at the price set by Smashwords authors and publishers (no discounting), or at the local currency equivalent. Smashwords will pay authors 60% list after the deduction of VAT taxes, if any (similar to how we pay for iBooks sales).&amp;nbsp; In the months ahead, Smashwords will also supply preorders to txtr because their platform supports preorders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smashwords titles will begin appearing for sale at txtr on or shortly after this Friday. Smashwords authors are automatically opted in to txtr as with all new Smashwords channels, but may opt out anytime from the Smashwords Dashboard's &lt;a href="https://www.smashwords.com/dashboard/channelManager"&gt;Channel Manager&lt;/a&gt; in the next three days to prevent their titles from going on sale (we &lt;b&gt;do not&lt;/b&gt; recommend opting out!).&amp;nbsp; As with all new retail and library partners, we send test shipments in advance of each partner's launch and we always provide an opt-out window of at least 48 hours. You'll see these test shipments in your Channel Manager.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll send out an email notification on Tuesday to all Smashwords authors covering the txtr agreement and additional important news yet to come (stay tuned!).&lt;img src="//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Smashwords/~4/khbnhi_Qmbc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Smashwords/~3/khbnhi_Qmbc/smashwords-to-distribute-250000-ebooks.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Mark Coker)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ncLJrjaHYH4/U3orwAPHd2I/AAAAAAAACZ0/j1UQUDSNnyw/s72-c/txtr+Smashwords.png" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>14</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/05/smashwords-to-distribute-250000-ebooks.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7436915084701775452.post-6463805426940063106</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2014 14:50:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2014-05-19T16:27:51.733-07:00</atom:updated><title>Smashwords Introduces Faster Deliveries to iBooks</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8lfxZCAAWr8/U3qTYJqintI/AAAAAAAACaU/GgC_ntE2y5I/s1600/ibookssolo.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8lfxZCAAWr8/U3qTYJqintI/AAAAAAAACaU/GgC_ntE2y5I/s1600/ibookssolo.png" height="200" width="148" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In recent weeks, many Smashwords authors have noticed that our deliveries to iBooks have become remarkably faster, and iBooks is listing the books faster.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some authors have seen their books appear for sale at iBooks the same day they upload to Smashwords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price changes and other metadata updates made in the Smashwords Dashboard for Premium Catalog-approved books are often reflected within hours at iBooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new lightning-fast listings represent a welcome milestone in a multi-year initiative here at Smashwords to continually improve every aspect of our distribution systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’re working to provide our authors and publishers faster retailer deliveries and faster metadata updates with the highest possible accuracy and reliability. We’re now shipping five times daily seven days per week to iBooks, and in the months ahead we’ll push that envelope further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The faster listings at iBooks are also due in great part to iBooks recognizing the continuous improvements, both from an efficiency and accuracy perspective, of our vetting team here in Los Gatos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our vetting team manually inspects thousands of new titles and updates each week to ensure they meet the requirements of our retail partners and the expectations of readers.&amp;nbsp; We vet the titles so our retailer and library partners don’t have to.&amp;nbsp; We view our vetting as an important value-add that helps produce higher-quality books for the benefit of our authors, readers and retailers.&amp;nbsp; A key dividend for our authors is lightning-fast listings at iBooks (erotica titles go through additional manual review by Apple, so they won’t list as quickly). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;iBooks has been an amazing partner to Smashwords authors over the last four years, ever since they selected us to serve among a small handful of authorized aggregators to supply ebooks to what was then known as the iBookstore.&amp;nbsp; On day one of the &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2010/04/smashwords-ebooks-ipad-ebook-publishing.html"&gt;launch of the iPad&lt;/a&gt;, over 2,000 Smashwords titles graced their maiden iBooks catalog. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the four years since, the iBooks team has encouraged us to push the envelope in all aspects of our business, from technology to operations to new feature development.&amp;nbsp; We readily embraced these challenges because Apple inspires us to do really cool projects that help our author reach more readers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s thanks to iBooks that we made preorder distribution one of our biggest developmental priorities of the last 12 months, and our efforts have paid off by helping numerous Smashwords authors top the charts at iBooks and elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We launched the Smashwords Series Manager tool last September with iBooks expressly in mind.&amp;nbsp; When I announced Series Manager &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/09/new-smashwords-series-manager-improves.html"&gt;here at the blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and urged our authors to adopt it with gusto, I speculated how the tool would give our retail partners greater flexibility to promote Smashwords titles.&amp;nbsp; I wrote, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Let's say, for example, a retailer wants to do a merchandising promotion of the top 50 bestselling Smashwords series that have a free series starter.&amp;nbsp; Without the series metadata, it would be nearly impossible for Smashwords or our retailer to accurately identify which books are in a series, and in which order."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m sure a few healthy skeptics read my imaginings above as vaguely plausible, but 50 authors receiving feature promotion?&amp;nbsp; Really?&amp;nbsp; And then, as readers of this blog know, last month iBooks launched a massive &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/04/ibooks-free-series-starter-promotion.html"&gt;FREE series starter promotion&lt;/a&gt; that featured 80 Smashwords authors.&amp;nbsp; Cool beans!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this only scratches the surface of how Series Manager can empower retailers to create new and innovative promotions that help readers discover and enjoy Smashwords authors.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These and other capabilities have reaped measurable rewards for Smashwords authors, and not just at iBooks but across our entire distribution network.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tools empower indie authors with powerful capabilities and discoverability that heretofore weren’t possible in the days of print publishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks in part to the assisting power of preorders and the enhanced series listings enabled by Series Manager, many Smashwords authors have built massive readership at iBooks over the last year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tools like preorders and Series Manager alone do not create bestsellers.&amp;nbsp; Everything starts with a super-awesome author producing a super-awesome book adorned by a super-awesome cover.&amp;nbsp; Authors supply their incredible books, and these tools provide incremental advantage.&amp;nbsp; In the game of publishing, everything is about incremental advantage.&amp;nbsp; One step at a time, building and building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;

We’re working to make distributing through Smashwords more advantageous for our authors than uploading direct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Authors who distribute through Smashwords have &lt;b&gt;more time to write&lt;/b&gt; because they’re spending less time managing multiple upload platforms.&amp;nbsp; We give our authors single-upload access to a broad and growing network of sales outlets, centralized metadata management and book updates, and access to exclusive sales and merchandising tools. If we can give you more time to write and empower you with professional-grade tools that give you incremental advantage, over the long run you'll out-perform other authors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every new author at Smashwords benefits the entire worldwide community of Smashwords authors. I want every writer in the world to someday choose to publish and distribute their book with Smashwords.&amp;nbsp; That’s my dream at least, and I’m sticking to it!&amp;nbsp; To reach this goal, we’ll never stop innovating on your behalf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, iBooks team, for helping us push the envelope so we can serve the common interests of iBooks customers and Smashwords authors. Thanks also and always to Smashwords authors and publishers who support us in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More cool tools on the way!&lt;img src="//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Smashwords/~4/L2YcB9sjrUA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Smashwords/~3/L2YcB9sjrUA/smashwords-introduces-faster-deliveries.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Mark Coker)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8lfxZCAAWr8/U3qTYJqintI/AAAAAAAACaU/GgC_ntE2y5I/s72-c/ibookssolo.png" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>16</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/05/smashwords-introduces-faster-deliveries.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7436915084701775452.post-9012927412182611598</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2014 21:48:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2014-05-21T17:43:40.991-07:00</atom:updated><title>Scribd Features 18 Smashwords Authors in Exclusive Merchandising Promotion</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dN0rwC2ywJY/U3DJMR7BO_I/AAAAAAAACZI/QG52q1TPruM/s1600/Scribd+pop+indie.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dN0rwC2ywJY/U3DJMR7BO_I/AAAAAAAACZI/QG52q1TPruM/s1600/Scribd+pop+indie.png" height="156" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Scribd today launched an exclusive front-page merchandising promotion titled “Popular Indie Authors” featuring 18 Smashwords authors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrats to featured authors Kristen Ashley, Brian S. Pratt, Quinn  Loftis, F.S. Michaels, Jean Sasson, E.P.&amp;nbsp; Lenderking, Daniel Alick, John  Locke, Amy Miles, Morgan Rice, JD Nixon, Rebecca Ethington, Shayne  Parkinson, Julie Kenner, John Rember, Jaden Skye, Chris Dolley and  Rachel Astor.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The featured authors represent a diverse cross-section of genres and categories, including fantasy, biography, mystery, thriller, historical fiction, contemporary romance, paranormal romance, YA romance, and dystopian SciFi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curated row of books will rotate among other curated and  automatically generated suggested-reading rows for Scribd subscribers.&amp;nbsp; The promotion runs at least two weeks.  View the titles here - &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/collections/4460621/Popular-Indie"&gt;http://www.scribd.com/collections/4460621/Popular-Indie&lt;/a&gt; or log into your Scribd subscription to view the promotion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last two months, as promised in our original &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/12/smashwords-signs-distribution-agreement.html"&gt;Scribd announcement&lt;/a&gt; in December, all Smashwords authors with books opted into our Scribd distribution channel as of early January received a free one-year subscription to Scribd valued at $100.&amp;nbsp; The activation links were sent out via email, and the last batch went out last week.&amp;nbsp; If you haven’t activated your account, please do so now before the offer expires (and if you never received the email, check your spam filters). Scribd has kindly extended the original deadline for activation until June 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Smashwords catalog went live at Scribd on February 28, 2014, the last day of the month.&amp;nbsp; The first full month’s sales (March) exceeded my expectations.&amp;nbsp; It was the largest first-month sales for any new Smashwords retail partner in the last five years.&amp;nbsp; I know our friends at Scribd were equally pleased by the popularity of Smashwords titles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April results were even more impressive, showing a month-over-month sequential gain of 60%.&amp;nbsp; Although the sales volume at Scribd hasn't reached the level of iBooks, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, Kobo and the Smashwords store, they're off to a strong start by any measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their April results alone represent nearly triple the recent combined sales of Sony and Diesel, two Smashwords retailers that exited the ebook business in March, and already represent 1/3 our Kobo sales. I’m excited to see where Scribd can take this over the next few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scribd is on track to become a major contributor to the bottom lines of indie authors, and like big fishes in small pond, Smashwords authors are there first, reaching new readers, and building platform advantage that will reap dividends for years to come.&amp;nbsp; If you don't have all your Smashwords titles opted in to Scribd, you're missing out.&amp;nbsp; Visit your Smashwords Dashboard's Channel Manager screen to make sure all your Premium Catalog titles are opted in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think history will show that the new breed of subscription ebook services like Scribd will grow the number of readers who are enjoying and consuming ebooks.&amp;nbsp; They'll expand the reading audience and help authors reach readers that aren't shopping at conventional retail channels where books are purchased one at a time. The two models for ebook consumption are complementary. With subscription ebook services, readers surf books effortlessly, as if visiting a massive online library, and once they hit a percentage threshold of pages read for an individual title, it triggers a full sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned in the original announcement of our distribution &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/12/smashwords-signs-distribution-agreement.html"&gt;relationship with Scribd&lt;/a&gt;, Scribd has repositioned their entire business around the ebook subscription model.&amp;nbsp; The site is visited by 80 million readers each month. Scribd is working to funnel all these readers into their paid subscription service.&amp;nbsp; They want to sell books for our authors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Scribd for this great promotion, and congratulations to these fine Smashwords authors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can't Get Enough of Ebook Subscriptions? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to learn more about the business model of the subscription ebook services, and how these services might shape the future of reading, here are three opportunities to learn more:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;The Smashwords Blog.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; Check out my two part blog series starting with my post, &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/10/examining-business-model-of-ebook.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Examining the Business Model of Ebook Subscription Services&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;Attend a panel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt; At BEA in New York on May 29 (happy birthday to me), I'm participating on a panel that will explore all aspects of the ebook subscription model titled, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bisg.org/events/making-information-pay-2014"&gt;A Substantial Difference: How Subscription Affects the Form and Value of Content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The panel is moderated by the awesome Peter Brantley.&amp;nbsp; The panel will be part of BISG's Making Information Pay conference hosted at BEA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;The Great Debate.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; And for those of you who can't get enough of the subscription model (or you hate it or you love it or just want to learn more), on June 11 at Noon Eastern I'm participating in a webinar debate about subscription ebook services produced by Digital Book World.&amp;nbsp; The debate is modeled after the &lt;a href="http://intelligencesquaredus.org/"&gt;Intelligence Squared U.S&lt;/a&gt;. debate series on NPR.&amp;nbsp; This will be interesting.&amp;nbsp; The proposition is, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;“The success of ebook subscription services will be good for publishers, authors and readers.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; Arguing in favor of this proposition will be the team of Andrew Weinstein of Scribd and yours truly (woo hoo!).&amp;nbsp; Our formidable opponents, who will argue against the proposition, are Gareth Cuddy, an ebook distributor, and Jonathan Blum a super-smart journalist for TheStreet.com who will probably cut us to pieces with his wit, charm and oratory skill. The debate is moderated by Jeremy Greenfield, editorial director for Digital Book World.&amp;nbsp; The debate is won or lost based on the number of listeners we convert to our side of the argument.&amp;nbsp; They will poll viewers before the debate and ask them if they agree or disagree.&amp;nbsp; At the end of the debate, they poll viewers again to see which side changed the most minds.&amp;nbsp; This means that if 98% of viewers agree with the proposition at the beginning, and 97% percent agree at the end, we lose.&amp;nbsp; It'll be all in good fun!!&amp;nbsp; Register for this free event at &lt;a href="https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/302153160"&gt;https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/302153160&lt;/a&gt; and learn more at &lt;a href="http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2014/announcing-dbw-debates-ebook-subscription-services/"&gt;Digital Book World&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img src="//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Smashwords/~4/1JgxBFB2XFE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Smashwords/~3/1JgxBFB2XFE/scribd-features-18-smashwords-authors.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Mark Coker)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dN0rwC2ywJY/U3DJMR7BO_I/AAAAAAAACZI/QG52q1TPruM/s72-c/Scribd+pop+indie.png" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>9</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/05/scribd-features-18-smashwords-authors.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7436915084701775452.post-2877582942838884358</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2014 04:19:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2014-05-11T21:25:52.375-07:00</atom:updated><title>Scribd’s Improved Copyright Protection Systems Reaping Results for Smashwords Authors</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0yjpZ3V8220/U3A7jj_voxI/AAAAAAAACY4/YhszCgA6SJc/s1600/scribdbuttonNews.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0yjpZ3V8220/U3A7jj_voxI/AAAAAAAACY4/YhszCgA6SJc/s1600/scribdbuttonNews.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Scribd was founded about six years ago as a document upload service.&amp;nbsp; To their credit, they made the upload of multi-format documents and files ridiculously easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, their site hosts 50 million documents and books, receives thousands of new uploads every day, and is visited by 80 million monthly readers from over 100 different countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside of their ease-of-upload, however, is that many users – often enthusiastic readers who don’t understand or respect copyright – attempt to upload unauthorized, copyrighted works, including the ebooks of many Smashwords authors.&amp;nbsp; It’s the same challenge YouTube faces with unauthorized video uploads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following our announcement&amp;nbsp; in December that &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/12/smashwords-signs-distribution-agreement.html"&gt;Smashwords would soon begin supplying ebooks to Scribd&lt;/a&gt;, both for retail sales and for inclusion in their subscription service, I heard from several Smashwords authors who were understandably upset to discover unauthorized versions of their books at Scribd. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some questioned why we would partner with Scribd.&amp;nbsp; As I’ve shared with authors who have expressed concern, and as I’ll reiterate here, we wouldn’t have partnered with Scribd if we weren't confident their heart was in the right place, and if we weren't confident our relationship with Scribd would benefit all indie authors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scribd has 80 million readers, and we’ve got over 300,000 books.&amp;nbsp; We want to connect those readers' eyeballs and wallets and purses with our books.&amp;nbsp; We want our authors to receive the full payment they deserve for their hard work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scribd wants the same thing. Scribd wants to do right by the indie author community because they know  their business is dependent upon earning and deserving the trust and  support of authors everywhere.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Scribd’s enthusiastic blessing, I orchestrated a conference call in January for Scribd’s top executives with several concerned Smashwords authors. Scribd wanted to hear our authors' concerns, and then after listening Scribd shared their plans to combat the unauthorized uploads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the call, Scribd shared how they planned to release a major update to their copyright protection system in the next few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m pleased to report that Scribd is delivering. Scribd has made some impressive strides over the last few months toward eradicating unauthorized content. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scribd has since renamed their copyright protection technology Book ID.&amp;nbsp; In a nutshell, here's how it works:&amp;nbsp; BookID automatically scans all Smashwords-delivered books, and analyzes the text for semantic data such as word count, letter frequency, phrases, and other elements. BookID then creates a digital fingerprint of the authorized Smashwords book, and uses this fingerprint to automatically detect and remove unauthorized versions.&amp;nbsp; It proactively removes all files at Scribd that match the same fingerprint, and also uses this fingerprint to proactively block the upload of future unauthorized versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply by distributing to Scribd via Smashwords, our authors receive a measure of protective benefit from the BookID technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to share some hard numbers with you to illustrate the progress Scribd has made to respect and protect the copyright of Smashwords books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of January 9, the BookID had detected and removed 3,745 book files from Scribd representing 1,725 unique Smashwords books.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In March, Scribd released a new and improved version of BookID, as they promised they would during their call with the Smashwords authors.&amp;nbsp; The new BookID system has dramatically increased Scribd’s ability to detect unauthorized versions.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of today, Scribd reports to me BookID has removed 47,858 unauthorized copies of 14,090 unique Smashwords books. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although no automated scanning system will every be 100% accurate, I’m pleased by the progress and effort made by our friends at Scribd.&amp;nbsp; I’m pleased that every visitor to the Scribd home page is prompted to purchase a paid subscription to Scribd’s service, because this converts free readers to paid readers for the benefit of Smashwords authors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the support of Smashwords authors who now supply 225,000 titles to Scribd, it's getting tougher for users to upload unauthorized content. With every new Smashwords title delivered, the cleanup continues.&amp;nbsp; The situation will improve further as Scribd enhances their BookID technology in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn more about Scribd's BookID technology at &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/copyright/bookid"&gt;http://www.scribd.com/copyright/bookid&lt;/a&gt; and learn more about Scribd’s commitment to protect your copyright at their new and improved &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/copyright"&gt;Copyright Resource Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll report more exciting Scribd news tomorrow regarding the impressive sales growth we're seeing at Scribd, plus some other big news so stay tuned!&lt;img src="//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Smashwords/~4/vRQXvPO-x4E" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Smashwords/~3/vRQXvPO-x4E/update-on-scribds-efforts-to-protect.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Mark Coker)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0yjpZ3V8220/U3A7jj_voxI/AAAAAAAACY4/YhszCgA6SJc/s72-c/scribdbuttonNews.png" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>15</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/05/update-on-scribds-efforts-to-protect.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7436915084701775452.post-4437435161915229079</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2014 00:44:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2014-05-12T07:49:43.796-07:00</atom:updated><title>Smashwords Romance Authors Promoted at RT Booklovers in New Orleans</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

The drive received heavy advance promotion by the conference organizers.&amp;nbsp; Filling out the drive are hundreds of popular Smashwords romance authors including several NY Times and USA Today bestsellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The promotion was offered free of charge to participating authors and publishers.&amp;nbsp; Each  author received a dedicated folder featuring their book in multiple  formats.&amp;nbsp; The drive includes a &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/w0gmn6ao3b32f0e/TopSmashwordsRomanceAuthorsRTBooklovers.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; that lists all participating authors and books, along with direct hyperlinks to each author's Smashwords profile page so readers can check out the authors' other books.&amp;nbsp; The drive also includes two free digital issues of RT Book Reviews Magazine and a free Smashwords publishing kit &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This promotion is one of the many perks of working with Smashwords.&amp;nbsp; It's our way of saying &lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;thank you&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt; for  publishing and distributing with Smashwords!&amp;nbsp; We hope to do similar promotions in the future to support our authors.&amp;nbsp;

Noble, ebook preorders via Smashwords are your ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most Smashwords authors who've done ebook preorders with Smashwords know that one of the many great advantages of a preorder is that accumulated preorders credit all at once at Apple and Kobo on the day the book goes onsale, causing the book to pop in the bestseller lists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What most authors don't know is that the same magical dynamic happens at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble as well.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;I didn't know this until today!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're not incorporating preorders - and specifically B&amp;amp;N preorders - into your next book launch, you're missing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, here's how the dynamic works at B&amp;amp;N, Apple and Kobo:&amp;nbsp; Let's say your book is listed on preorder for 60 days in advance of your official onsale date.&amp;nbsp; Let's say that at B&amp;amp;N (or iBooks or Kobo) your book accumulates 15 orders per day.&amp;nbsp; After two months of order accumulation, you'd have 900 orders.&amp;nbsp; These 900 orders would credit all at once on the first day when your book goes onsale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since every retailer's bestseller charts are based upon unit sales, and all charts give greater weighting to sales credited during the most recent 24-hour period, it's like selling 900 copies in a single day.&amp;nbsp; And that's before counting the additional sales that come once the book goes onsale.&amp;nbsp; With 900+ sales at any retailer in a day, you're going to land near the top of your book's genre or category list, and probably also within the store's top-10 or top-20 store-wide bestseller list.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't need to accumulate 900 orders to receive a boost from preorders.&amp;nbsp; Even 10, 20 or 30 accumulated orders will give you an incremental discoverability advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By landing higher in the charts, your book becomes more visible and more desirable to readers who use the bestseller lists to discover their next read.&amp;nbsp; And let's not forget&amp;nbsp; the value of the permanent bragging rights that come when your book achieves bestseller status at multiple retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since we announced &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/07/smashwords-introduces-preorder.html"&gt;preorder distribution&lt;/a&gt; last July to iBooks, B&amp;amp;N and Kobo, I mistakenly believed that B&amp;amp;N preorders didn't deliver the same first-day kick in the charts.&amp;nbsp; I began to question my assumption last week when Nicky Charles' new preorder release, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/424003"&gt;Betrayed: Book Two - The Road to Redemption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, landed near the top of the charts at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble (she did the same at iBooks!).&amp;nbsp; When I looked closely at the B&amp;amp;N sales reports, I noted that all her preorders credited on the first day.&amp;nbsp; Earlier today I confirmed the behavior with our friends at B&amp;amp;N.&amp;nbsp; Yay!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it.&amp;nbsp; The day-one pop in the charts at B&amp;amp;N is confirmed.&amp;nbsp; If you're not yet distributing preorders via Smashwords to B&amp;amp;N, iBooks and Kobo, plan now to do it with your next release.&amp;nbsp; Multiple Smashwords authors have already hit the bestseller lists - and charted higher -&amp;nbsp; thanks the added kick of preorders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn more about ebook preorders at &lt;a href="http://smashwords.com/preorder"&gt;http://smashwords.com/preorder&lt;/a&gt;, or in my ebook preorder strategy blog post and presentation, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/02/hit-ebook-bestseller-lists-with.html"&gt;Hit the Ebook Bestseller Lists - A Guide to Ebook Preorder Strategy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, we haven't announced this yet (well, I suppose I'm announcing it today!) - Once your preorder is loaded at Smashwords, you can now change the onsale date self-serve from your Smashwords Dashboard (thank you Daphne on the Smashwords engineering team!). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next Thursday May 15 at the &lt;a href="https://www.rtconvention.com/person/mark-coker"&gt;RT Convention&lt;/a&gt; in New Orleans, and then again on May 31 at &lt;a href="http://www.bookexpoamerica.com/BEA-Conferences/DIY-Authors-Conference/#page=page-2"&gt;uPublishU&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, I'm presenting a workshop on ebook preorder strategy.&amp;nbsp;

Yesterday it was the bestselling poetry book at iBooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it not because it's a great book (it is!), but because this book will serve as the blueprint to help educators and parents around the globe bring similar ebook publishing projects to the classroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to nearly 120 great poems organized under ten themes, it&amp;nbsp; contains a Teacher's Guide that shares the step-by-step process this class followed to professionally write, edit, produce and publish a poetry anthology ebook in under five weeks.&amp;nbsp; I wrote the preface to the Teacher's Guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to see similar poetry and creative writing ebook publishing projects incorporated into the curriculum of classrooms around the globe.&amp;nbsp; With your help, we can make it happen for the benefit of the children and young adults in every community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to free ebook publishing platforms such as Smashwords, the democratization of retail distribution, and the best practices publishing knowledge of indie authors, projects such as this are now feasible for elementary school students, high school students and college students around the globe. Such projects will teach students how to collaborate to write, produce and publish ebooks.&amp;nbsp; In the process, the world's next generation of writers will gain a practical appreciation for the magic of words and the joy of publishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;

&lt;br /&gt;hit #1 in the Poetry category at iBooks&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The project grew out of an ongoing collaboration between The Los Gatos Public Library and Smashwords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last few years, I've been working with town librarian Henry Bankhead to develop community publishing programs in partnership with the library.&amp;nbsp; The goal of our partnership is to identify systems, processes and initiatives that libraries everywhere can implement to foster a culture of professional authorship in their local communities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I blogged about our work with Los Gatos Public Library and my vision for libraries-as-community-publishing-portals last year for &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-coker/library-ebooks_b_2951953.html"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; As I mentioned in the post, we ran a pilot program in which Smashwords presented three educational workshops at the library to help library staff and local writers learn how to e-publish like professionals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the initial pilot program with the library, Henry Bankhead and I started brainstorming how we could take our community publishing ideas to the next level.&amp;nbsp; I thought it would be really cool if we could collaborate with my alma matter, Los Gatos High School, to incorporate an ebook publishing pilot project into the class curriculum for a creative writing class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea was that such a project would be really fun for the students, and would help them gain a practical appreciation for writing and publishing.&amp;nbsp; So Henry arranged for the two of us to meet with teacher Tonya McQuade who taught three periods of freshman honors poetry classes of about 25 students each.&amp;nbsp; Tonya agreed to lead the project, and also arranged for another freshman poetry teacher, Kathleen Wehr, to participate.&amp;nbsp; Kathleen brought with her about 50 more students, increasing the total number of students to around 120.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry Bankhead also applied for, and received, a modest grant to create a "mobile publishing lab" comprised of a Mac laptop, software and several iPads which were donated to the school to support the project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my original project proposal, I suggested that that classes price their ebook at FREE, because that price would help the students reach the most readers.&amp;nbsp; However, after speaking with fellow teachers, Tonya McQuade came up with the idea to give the book a price so the freshman class could use the book as a fundraiser to raise money for the students' 2016 senior ball.&amp;nbsp; Cool beans!&amp;nbsp; What a great idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave two sets of presentations to each of the five classes, each about 50 minutes long.&amp;nbsp; The first presentation was an Introduction to Ebook Publishing, and the second presentation focused on 16 best practices for professional ebook publishing.&amp;nbsp; The goal of both presentations was to train the students how to think like a professional indie author.&amp;nbsp; Download &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Smashwords/ebook-publishing-in-the-classroom"&gt;Ebook Publishing in the Classroom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at Slideshare.&amp;nbsp; I give permission to all educators to take my presentations and use them or modify them for use in their classrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;

Design, Art &amp;amp; Photography and Marketing &amp;amp; Publicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a dual purpose to these breakout teams:&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt; 1.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; To help these young adults experience the processes and practices of professional publishing.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt; To get the book done!&amp;nbsp; Without a distribution of responsibilities, it would have been impossible to pull off this project in a mere five weeks, and that's not counting nearly a week lost for spring break in the middle of the project!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;

It also includes photographs of the teams in action, a copy of their press release, and instructions on how to write and promote a press release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night the students held their book launch party at The Los Gatos Public Library.&amp;nbsp; Over 100 students, proud parents and library patrons were on hand to hear the students give poetry readings from the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The even was standing room only.&amp;nbsp; Henry Bankhead tells me it was one the largest and most well-attended events held at the library in the last year.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cfF3L1nkaF8/U2plaEDPE9I/AAAAAAAACYA/IJA2RGTZi80/s1600/booklaunch.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left;

Several students read their poems.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I'd like to give special thanks to Tonya McQuade of Los Gatos High School.&amp;nbsp; This was an ambitious, first-of-it's-kind pilot project, and it wouldn't have been possible without her leadership and passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She believed in her students.&amp;nbsp; She had the confidence that her students would rise to the occasion and attack this project with passion and enthusiasm, and that's exactly what they did.&amp;nbsp; She represents the best of the best educators everywhere. And thanks to the power of ebook self publishing, fellow educators now have the tools they need to unlock, unleash and realize the creative potential that lives within every child and young adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This important project - where group of high school students publish a bestselling poetry anthology available for purchase by a global audience at the world's largest retailers - would have been impossible just a few short years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Gutenberg did for mass market print book publishing, ebook self-publishing will do for the future of digital books.&amp;nbsp; More better books will be published thanks to self-publishing, and the earlier writers are exposed to self publishing best practices, the better their writing will become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're an indie author, educator, librarian or lover of books, you have an opportunity to help promote a culture of professional indie authorship in your community.&amp;nbsp; Partner with your local library and school.&amp;nbsp; Offer to be a mentor to provide local students and teachers the knowledge of how to self publish like a pro (these training presentations I gave above could just as easily be presented by a Smashwords author in the community!).&amp;nbsp; Help schools build upon our experiences to implement similar ebook publishing class projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With your help, the next generation of readers and writers will gain a new appreciation for books and the joy of self publishing.&amp;nbsp; And with your help, projects such as this will lead to more better books for generations to come.&lt;img src="//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Smashwords/~4/X2FDcN0OxZ0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Smashwords/~3/X2FDcN0OxZ0/ebook-publishing-in-classroom-los-gatos.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Mark Coker)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KkyGZwaCzvU/U2pJ1JGXpRI/AAAAAAAACXM/9gGeO5fQ7Ec/s72-c/windowscover.jpg" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>11</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/05/ebook-publishing-in-classroom-los-gatos.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7436915084701775452.post-5719377874986203322</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 19:30:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2014-04-26T10:31:42.068-07:00</atom:updated><title>Indie Author Manifesto</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CZFerSIscX4/U1gTaYMrnvI/AAAAAAAACWI/rTn5kNCG9o4/s1600/sw+hand+manifesto.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CZFerSIscX4/U1gTaYMrnvI/AAAAAAAACWI/rTn5kNCG9o4/s1600/sw+hand+manifesto.png" height="320" width="205" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Over the last six years since founding Smashwords, I've witnessed a dramatic change in attitudes regarding self publishing.&amp;nbsp; I'm pleased that much of this transformation has been led by the professional example of Smashwords authors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where once self publishing was viewed as the option of last resort - the option for failed writers and an option marked by stigma and shame - self publishing is increasingly viewed as the option of first choice for many writers.&amp;nbsp; Over the next couple years I think we'll reach a point where more first-time writers aspire to indie-publish than traditionally publish.&amp;nbsp; Indie authors are the cool kids club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All writers possess unrealized potential, and indie authors understand  that.&amp;nbsp; Ebook self publishing provides the mechanism by which every writer's  true potential can be realized. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At writers conferences I've met numerous Smashwords authors who are moved to happy tears when they describe how self publishing has transformed their lives.&amp;nbsp; I've lost track of the number of times I've felt a lump grow in my throat as I hear their inspiring stories.&amp;nbsp; These encounters are deeply moving to me, and I trust that you too have experienced the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside observers might counter that of course the bestsellers feel this way.&amp;nbsp; Yes, that's true, but as any indie author will tell you, the joy of self publishing cannot be distilled to dollar metrics alone.&amp;nbsp; How does one describe the importance of independence, freedom and self-determination?&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Critics say self publishing is causing a tsunami of drek that will destroy book culture and render the best books undiscoverable.&amp;nbsp; Not true.&amp;nbsp; Yes, self publishing will enable more horrible books to be published than ever before, but it will also enable more better books to be published, discoverable and enjoyable than ever before.&amp;nbsp; There's a yin and yang to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not an exaggeration to describe the indie author revolution as a global cultural movement.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I think we're witnessing something profound here as we transition from a publisher-centric world to an author-centric world.&amp;nbsp; The rise of indie authorship as a global cultural movement is driven by profound changes in social norms, ethical values, customs, belief systems, technology and business practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this radical change in mind, today I attempt to describe the movement and motivations of its drivers - the indie authors - in the form of my Indie Author Manifesto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attempt to answer a simple question:&amp;nbsp; What does it mean to be an indie author?&amp;nbsp; I've distilled the movement down to ten principles that I think capture the mindset of indie authors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tip my hat to the many great manifestos that have come before my own meager attempt, including the&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html"&gt;US Declaration of Independence&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments"&gt;10 Commandments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther"&gt;Martin Luther&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/95_Theses"&gt;95 Thesis&lt;/a&gt; among others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE INDIE AUTHOR MANIFESTO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We indie authors believe all writers are created equal, that all writers are endowed with natural creative potential, and that writers have an unalienable right to exercise, explore and realize their potential through the freedom of publication. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hold these truths to be self-evident:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am an indie author&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have experienced the pleasure and satisfaction that comes from self-publishing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a right to publish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My creative control is important to me.&amp;nbsp; I decide when, where and how my writing graduates to become a published book.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Indie does not mean “alone.”&amp;nbsp; I choose my partners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I shall not bow beholden or subservient to any publisher. In my business relationships, I seek partnership, fairness, equity and mutually aligned interests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We indie authors comprise diverse writers unified by a common purpose to advance, empower and celebrate writers everywhere.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am a professional.&amp;nbsp; I take pride in my work, and I strive to improve my craft to better serve my readers, myself, my fellow indie authors and the culture of books&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My writing is valuable and important.&amp;nbsp; This value and importance cannot be measured by commercial sales alone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I celebrate the success of my fellow indie authors, for their success is mine, and mine theirs. Together we are pioneering a better future for books marked by greater quality, creativity, diversity, choice, availability, affordability and accessibility. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derek Murphy (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/creativindie"&gt;@creativindie&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; /&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.creativindie.com/"&gt;www.creativindie.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.creativindiecovers.com/"&gt;www.creativindiecovers.com&lt;/a&gt;) graciously created this infographic of the manifesto.&amp;nbsp; Click to download, print or share!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-veawKqk0R7A/U1q8vDl1wkI/AAAAAAAACW8/7fxZxa-ftyA/s1600/indiemanifestoposter1+corrected+1000.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-veawKqk0R7A/U1q8vDl1wkI/AAAAAAAACW8/7fxZxa-ftyA/s1600/indiemanifestoposter1+corrected+1000.png" height="640" width="424" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wrote a version of the &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-coker/the-indie-author-manifest_b_5207392.html"&gt;Indie Author Manifesto over at the Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img src="//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Smashwords/~4/hl2rpL4li18" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Smashwords/~3/hl2rpL4li18/indie-author-manifesto.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Mark Coker)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CZFerSIscX4/U1gTaYMrnvI/AAAAAAAACWI/rTn5kNCG9o4/s72-c/sw+hand+manifesto.png" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>62</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/04/indie-author-manifesto.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7436915084701775452.post-2827127029908496431</guid><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2014 01:35:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2014-04-19T18:35:46.507-07:00</atom:updated><title>Smashwords at uPublishU at BEA - Ebook Preorder Strategy and iBooks Merchandising Secrets</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MX6-g8Lc8Oo/U1MbLNoSbjI/AAAAAAAACV4/41xNt5zPg7U/s1600/upublishu_logo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MX6-g8Lc8Oo/U1MbLNoSbjI/AAAAAAAACV4/41xNt5zPg7U/s1600/upublishu_logo.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;If you live within reach of New York City, don't miss the &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bookexpoamerica.com/BEA-Conferences/DIY-Authors-Conference/#page=page-1"&gt;uPublishU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; self-publishing conference taking place Saturday, May 31 2014 at the Javits Center between 9am and 4pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;40 speakers will share their smarts to help indie authors take their publishing to the next the level.&amp;nbsp; Register before May 15 for $115 and save $100 off of the regular $215 registration fee.&amp;nbsp; You'll find the registration link on the &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bookexpoamerica.com/BEA-Conferences/DIY-Authors-Conference/#page=page-1"&gt;uPublishU landing page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smashwords will be there in force as a sponsor so I hope you can make it.&amp;nbsp; We'll also have a table so please stop by and say hello.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conference this year promises to be their best yet.&amp;nbsp; They've broken the sessions into three concurrent tracks so you can choose the topics that best meet your goals and objectives.&amp;nbsp; The three tracks include &lt;i&gt;Bringing Your First Book to Market&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tools &amp;amp; Marketing Mania&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Publishing at the Next Level&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a full list of sessions and workshops, &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bookexpoamerica.com/BEA-Conferences/DIY-Authors-Conference/#page-2"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm presenting two workshops:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;10:00 am – 10:50 am&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hit the Bestseller Lists with Ebook Preorders: Preorder Strategy A-Z&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Track: Tools &amp;amp; Marketing Mania&lt;br /&gt;Room: 1E10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn how to make your book launch more successfully with ebook preorders. Preorders represent one of the most exciting new book launch tools for self-published ebook authors. In this session, Smashwords CEO Mark Coker will help unlock the secrets to preorder success. He’ll describe how preorders work, and will teach authors how to plan, stage and execute a successful preorder strategy. Using Mark’s methods, multiple Smashwords authors have hit the retailer bestseller lists. The recommended preorder strategies are grounded in professional publishing best practices that will help make any ebook launch more successful. Mark will share recent case study examples of how indie authors have used preorders to increase sales rank, sales and visibility.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;11:30 am – 12:20 pm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Apple iBooks Merchandising Strategies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Track: Publishing at the Next Level&lt;br /&gt;Room: 1E11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn how to reach more readers at Apple' iBooks!&amp;nbsp; iBooks is the world's second largest ebook retailer, and operates in 51 countries.

Although the session will focus on iBooks, the lessons learned are universal. Learn how to make your books stand out at every retailer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;uPublishU is one of several sister conferences taking place during BEA, North America's largest book conference.&amp;nbsp; BEA is one of my favorite conferences, and it's been cool to see how self publishing is becoming a bigger piece of each year's conference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bookexpoamerica.com/BEA-Conferences/DIY-Authors-Conference/#page=page-1"&gt;Click here to learn more about uPublishU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bookexpoamerica.com/Home/"&gt;Click here to learn more about BEA&lt;/a&gt;

We report our bestsellers based on dollar sales aggregated across the Smashwords distribution network which includes retailers such as iBooks, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, Kobo, the Smashwords store and &lt;a href="https://www.smashwords.com/distribution"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day I was browsing our &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/pw-select/article/61551-smashwords-self-published-bestseller-list-february-2014.html"&gt;February 2014 Smashwords bestseller list at Publishers Weekly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and realized that all the top 25 bestsellers were written by women.&amp;nbsp; Cool beans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wondering if this was a fluke, I looked at our &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/pw-select/article/60906-smashwords-self-published-bestseller-list-december-2013.html"&gt;December 2013 Smashwords bestseller list at PW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and bingo, same thing.&amp;nbsp; All 25 books were written by women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I looked at the &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/pw-select/article/60504-smashwords-self-published-bestseller-list-november-2013.html"&gt;bestseller list for November 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Same thing again.&amp;nbsp; 100% women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/pw-select/article/60218-smashwords-self-published-bestseller-list-october-2013.html"&gt;ebook bestsellers for October 2013?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; You guessed it, 100% women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're wondering why I skipped January in the examples above, it's because we and PW decided to shift the publication schedule to increase timeliness, so we skipped January and published February in March. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why are women dominating the Smashwords bestseller lists, other than the fact that these women are all super-awesome writers?&amp;nbsp; One likely factor is that romance is the #1 bestselling genre at Smashwords, and romance is overwhelmingly written by women.&amp;nbsp; I've said it before and I'll say it again:&amp;nbsp; I'm constantly blown away the smarts, savvy and sophistication of romance authors.&amp;nbsp; These ladies have pioneered many of the ebook publishing and distribution &lt;a href="http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/145431"&gt;best practices&lt;/a&gt; that so many indies take for granted today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But strong romance performance doesn't fully explain the story.&amp;nbsp; While 2/3 of our February bestseller list was romance, 1/3 was not, with the remaining categories including historical fiction, fantasy and mystery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could it be that there are more female writers than male writers?&amp;nbsp; I don't know the industry-wide or Smashwords-specific gender breakdowns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could it be fiction readers, which skew female, prefer books written by  women because the authors are women, or because women write stories that  are most appealing to women?&amp;nbsp; I don't know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For another reference point, I looked at today's top 25 bestsellers at the US iBooks store.&amp;nbsp; 64% written by women.&amp;nbsp; At Amazon US, 56% of today's top 25 bestsellers are written by women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a pattern here, but my data points above are too limited to draw a statistically significant conclusion.&amp;nbsp; For now, file the above under curious and unexplained observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the great work ladies!&lt;img src="//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Smashwords/~4/Bm0kH8U8VXs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Smashwords/~3/Bm0kH8U8VXs/female-authors-dominating-smashwords.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Mark Coker)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EQAu5XNjnOo/U0bXy9yewBI/AAAAAAAACVo/VnylAXY58DA/s72-c/SW+women+authors+image.png" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>17</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/04/female-authors-dominating-smashwords.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7436915084701775452.post-3643477670816670183</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2014 07:16:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2014-04-05T16:20:04.670-07:00</atom:updated><title>Free Series Starter Promotion at iBooks Features Dozens of Smashwords Authors</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Smashwords-distributed books make over 80 appearances in the promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All featured Smashwords authors are taking advantage of Smashwords' new &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2013/09/new-smashwords-series-manager-improves.html"&gt;Series Manager merchandising tool&lt;/a&gt;, which we launched back in September.&amp;nbsp; As I mentioned in September, Series Manager enables authors to attach their titles to series, which makes it easy for readers to easily identify books within a series, or across related series.&amp;nbsp; Just as importantly, series metadata gives Smashwords retailers greater flexibility to promote books within a series.&amp;nbsp; Apple's FIRST IN A SERIES promotion is one such manifestation of the new merchandising opportunities now available to Smashwords authors thanks to Series Manager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the US iBooks store, featured Smashwords titles are organized under categories of Mysteries and Thrillers, Romance, Sci-Fi &amp;amp; Fantasy, Paranormal Romance and Teen Fiction.&amp;nbsp; Please join me in congratulating the following Smashwords authors for their inclusion in this special merchandising feature:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mysteries &amp;amp;

Hugh Howey has recently lavished some welcome attention on this question at his &lt;a href="http://authorearnings.com/"&gt;AuthorEarnings.com&lt;/a&gt; web site (I examined the resulting uproar at &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/61116-hugh-howey-and-the-indie-author-revolt.html"&gt;Hugh Howey and the Indie Author Revolt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the commonly cited advantages of indie ebook publishing is that indies earn much higher "royalty" rates than traditionally published authors.&amp;nbsp; Smashwords authors typically earn 60-80% of the list price, versus traditionally published authors who earn 12.5% to 17.5% of the list price.&amp;nbsp; The rate paid by the publisher depends on whether their publisher is selling books under the wholesale or agency models. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's put some numbers on the bones of these percentages.&amp;nbsp; A Smashwords-distributed author earns $2.40 on a $3.99 ebook sold through one of our retailer partners, whereas a traditionally published author would earn about 50-70 cents.&amp;nbsp; In order for the traditionally published ebook author to earn the same $2.40, their ebook would have to be priced between $13.71 and $19.20.&amp;nbsp; This explains why talented authors are feeling such strong economic incentive to go indie.&amp;nbsp; Indies can price their product lower, but still earn more per unit sold than they can earn from traditional publishers who overprice their books yet continue to offer a small royalty percentage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AYfQgrJdKbw/Ux-dVzSwvVI/AAAAAAAACUw/ywfgOhPrDDo/s1600/modeling.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AYfQgrJdKbw/Ux-dVzSwvVI/AAAAAAAACUw/ywfgOhPrDDo/s1600/modeling.png" height="221" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The chart at the top of this page is generated off of the same estimates that created the chart at left which I first shared in &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/03/sizing-self-publishing-market-10.html"&gt;last week's post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chart at top was created by multiplying the percentage of the market going to indie ebook authors (at left) by 60%, and the percentage going to traditional authors by 15%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These percentages are approximations based on the spreads I mentioned above.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/e7wnquia5t9m506/modeling%20self%20publishing%20market%20share%20by%20Smashwords.xlsx"&gt;download my spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; to develop and share your own estimates.&amp;nbsp; Nothing would make me happier than for someone with better numbers to prove that my 2013 indie ebook market share estimate of 15% is too high (it would mean Smashwords authors have more upside in the future!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am confident, however, that the &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/03/sizing-self-publishing-market-10.html"&gt;10 winds of change&lt;/a&gt; I identified in the last post will lead indies to capture increased market share in the years ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's initially striking to me from the new chart at the top of the page is that 2014 could be the first year that the total dollars earned by indies at retail will equal dollars earned by traditional authors.&amp;nbsp; For 2020, the indie ebook community could earn almost four times more than the traditionally published ebook community will earn if indie ebook authors achieve the 50% market share I predict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next most striking thing is the slope of the curves. Note how steep the slope is for indie authors.&amp;nbsp; The linear market share growth I modeled for indies in last week's chart leads to a bigger differential in this week's chart in terms of the dollars going into indie authors' pockets vs. traditional authors' pockets. In plain English, for every retail dollar that shifts to an indie ebook, the author earns 60 cents.&amp;nbsp; For every dollar that goes to a traditionally published ebook, the author only earns 15 cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My charts and assumptions are not without their limitations. My numbers don't attempt to incorporate unearned advances, for example.&amp;nbsp; It's common for publishers to pay authors advances that are never earned out by book sales.&amp;nbsp; In such situations, the stated royalty percent underestimates what the author earned (it also represents a failure of the publisher to accurately estimate the commercial potential of a book).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An additional limitation of today's chart is that I'm assuming the current royalty rates stay the same. This is a dangerous assumption.&amp;nbsp; If Amazon lowers ebook rates like it lowered &lt;a href="http://authorearnings.com/acx-lowers-royalty-rates/"&gt;Audible audiobook rates&lt;/a&gt; the other week, Amazon would break my model and break the banks of many authors. Or, traditional publishers could heed the call of writers to increase their ebook royalty rates. Or, everyone could raise royalties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My projections paint a picture of an indie author community poised to capture an ever-larger share of ebook profits if print continues to decline in importance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this does not mean that indie authorship is the road to riches. The rise of self-published ebooks will lead to a glut of high-quality books that never go out of print. These books, combined with the ebook releases of traditional publishers, will accumulate on ebook retailer shelves and lead to more high-quality ebooks competing for a limited number of reader eyeballs.&amp;nbsp; It means readers will become more discerning.&amp;nbsp; It means all authors - indie or otherwise - will face more intense competition than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good books aren't good enough anymore.&amp;nbsp; Readers want wow books. Indies will deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Smashwords/~4/UW07Owt4DmE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Smashwords/~3/UW07Owt4DmE/indie-ebook-author-community-to-earn.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Mark Coker)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-X_fcm1n3Ba4/Ux-XBUDFjaI/AAAAAAAACUU/WdGpG-n0Cgs/s72-c/percentdollar.png" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>9</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/03/indie-ebook-author-community-to-earn.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7436915084701775452.post-2654971131748526836</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 04:41:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2014-03-23T14:14:15.583-07:00</atom:updated><title>10 Reasons Indie Authors Will Capture 50% of the Ebook Market by 2020</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I think indie ebooks will account for 50% of ebook sales by 2020.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you think? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one side of the debate, you have folks such as myself who believe all signs point toward indie ebook authors capturing an ever-greater percentage of the ebook market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other side you have folks who think self publishing represents an insignificant portion of the book&amp;nbsp; market.&amp;nbsp; The naysayers think we indie optimists are delusional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could both sides be right?&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, if you look at the numbers as they stand today, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; if you look at the trends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you look at the trends, a new picture emerges.&amp;nbsp; Yes, I understand it can be dangerous to extrapolate trends.&amp;nbsp; Any number of events can strike to disrupt or reverse a trend.&amp;nbsp; But if you have confidence in the drivers of a trend, and you think the wind in the sails of these drivers will blow stronger not weaker, then the future becomes plain as day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I'm contributing to the discussion by offering up a downloadable spreadsheet you can use to become your very own ebook pundit.&amp;nbsp;

text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4sqNmNQ9KP4/UxepIlJvHWI/AAAAAAAACTk/78czcLsnfNU/s1600/punditry+instructions.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4sqNmNQ9KP4/UxepIlJvHWI/AAAAAAAACTk/78czcLsnfNU/s1600/punditry+instructions.png" height="123" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;After you download the spreadsheet, open it and simply enter your estimates into the yellow cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;You'll place your estimates in two rows&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;1.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; In row 11, you'll estimate the percentage of trade book sales represented by print books (as you probably know, the term "trade book" refers to consumer books typically purchased through bookstores).&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;2.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; In row 13, you'll estimate the percentage of ebook market sales earned by indie ebook authors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter your numbers for each year from 2008 to 2020. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From these two rows of estimates, the spreadsheet will calculate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The percentage of trade book market sales represented by ebooks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The percentage of the overall trade book market represented by indie authors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The percentage of the overall trade book market represented by traditional publishers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;And then it will draw you a pretty chart.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I encourage you to take a screen shot of your chart, post it to your blog or favorite social media site, and then explain in your post the reasoning behind your estimates and beliefs.&amp;nbsp; Do me a favor and include a link back to this blog post so others can play the pundrity game too, and please also post a link in the comments below so that others can visit your blog and benefit from your opinions and insights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My estimates, and my pretty chart, are at the top of this post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm estimating ebooks for 2013 represented 30% of the overall US trade book market, and print books accounted for 70%.&amp;nbsp; Indie authors don't have access to print distribution for brick and mortars, so I've omitted any indie credit for print in my estimates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm estimating indie authors represented 15% of the ebook market.&amp;nbsp; Using these numbers, that means sales of self-published authors on the strength of ebooks alone accounted for &lt;b&gt;4.5% of the US trade book market for 2013&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; If my estimate is correct, it explains why publishers have maintained their intransigence when it comes to reforming their royalty rates and other business practices for which indies are now losing patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's easy for a naysayer to poo-poo this 4.5% as evidence that despite all the noise about the indie revolution, traditional publishing is still the main game in town.&amp;nbsp; Do these naysayers see the writing on the wall of where this is all leading?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some early signs publishers are beginning to feel the heat  from self published authors, and it comes from Harlequin, the grand dame of romance publishing.&amp;nbsp; In Harlequin's management discussion  portion of its 2013 earnings announcement (released March 4, 2014), the company for first time cited self publishing as a potential competitive risk:&amp;nbsp;  "The proliferation of less expensive, and free, self-published works  could negatively impact Harlequin’s revenues in the future." (hat tip &lt;a href="http://lunch.publishersmarketplace.com/2014/03/harlequin-results-fall/"&gt;Publishers Lunch&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.torstar.com/images/file/2013/2013MDA%20030414%20final%20v2.pdf"&gt;View the report here&lt;/a&gt; (opens a PDF). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sure there will be those who criticize my 2013-2020 estimates for being wildly optimistic, or crazily conservative.&amp;nbsp; Only time will tell.&amp;nbsp; My primary concerns are the general trends, the drivers of these trends, and what these trends mean for the writers we serve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I look to the future, I think the numbers start looking really exciting if you're in the indie author's shoes, and scary if you're a Big 5 publisher.&amp;nbsp; In my spreadsheet, I see indie authors accounting for 50% of ebook sales by the year 2020.&amp;nbsp; I think my estimates are fairly conservative.&amp;nbsp; Some people today think indie ebooks already account for 25% or more of ebook sales.&amp;nbsp; I'm modeling a steady but gradual shift from print to ebooks, and a steady but gradual increase in the indie ebook market share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my projections come to pass, indie authors will control over one third (35%) of the overall trade book market in seven years.&amp;nbsp; Go ahead, call me crazy or &lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2012/12/mark-cokers-2013-book-publishing.html"&gt;delusional&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I don't mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below, I'll explain why my numbers are more achievable than the naysayers think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;10 Reasons Indie Authors Will Capture Half of the Ebook Market by 2020&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Print will continue to decline&lt;/b&gt; as a book-reading format as more readers transition to screens. The transition to screens will be driven by the low prices, selection, exceptional discoverability and instant reading pleasure delivered by ebooks. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brick and mortar bookstores&lt;/b&gt; will continue their march into the sunset with more store closures.&amp;nbsp; I'm not happy about this, but I don't see the trend reversing unless bookstores start serving wine and pot brownies in their cafes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The perceived value of  publishers will decline&lt;/b&gt; in the eyes of writers as the importance of print distribution declines.&amp;nbsp; Print distribution is  an important glue that holds many writers to their traditional publishers.&amp;nbsp; When publisher stickiness decreases, writers will be tempted to explore the indie author camp.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Indie authors have learned to publish like professionals&lt;/b&gt;, which means self publishing will lead to more better books, and more diversity of better books.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The professionalism and sophistication of indie authors has increased dramatically in the six years since we launched Smashwords, and this professionalism will increase in the future as indies pioneer tomorrow's best practices.&amp;nbsp; These authors are publishing books that are quality-competitive with traditionally published books, but priced dramatically lower.&amp;nbsp; As a result, these authors have the ability to under-price, outsell and out-compete the ebooks from traditional publishers.&amp;nbsp; It means indie authors will have platform-building advantages over traditionally published authors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The number of self-published ebooks will explode&lt;/b&gt;, and these ebooks will  continue to enjoy democratized access to professional publishing and  distribution tools such as Smashwords, and democratized access to global  online retail distribution (every major ebook store wants to carry  self-published ebooks).&amp;nbsp; Every author - even indie authors - will face  increased competition from the glut of high quality works that never go out of print.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The most successful indie authors are mentoring the next generation of authors&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Indie authors act like a vast publishing collective of writers helping writers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The stigma once associated with self publishing is melting away&lt;/b&gt; at the same time the stigma of traditional publishing is on the rise.&amp;nbsp; Indie authors are in the cool kids club now.&amp;nbsp; They know they can publish with pride and professionalism, and they're developing teflon skin that deflects the once ego-bruising criticism levied by self publishing naysayers.&amp;nbsp; If you haven't been to a writers conference lately, go to one.&amp;nbsp; A  few years ago, writers would leave conferences depressed in the  knowledge that their dream agent only accepts one in 10,000 queries.&amp;nbsp;  Today, writers attend conferences and learn to self publish like a pro.&amp;nbsp; They leave the conference upbeat in the knowledge that one way or another, they'll publish their book their way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Writers are discovering the joy of self publishing&lt;/b&gt;. If publishers are from Mars, authors are from Venus.&amp;nbsp; They speak different languages and hold different values. The rewards of self publishing transcend the conventional and myopic commercial metric value systems of publishers.&amp;nbsp; Indie authors are enjoying total creative control, faster time to market, ownership over their publishing future, and the flexibility to innovate and evolve their immortal ebooks which will never go out of print.&amp;nbsp; Indie authors enjoy the freedom to serve their fans as they want to serve them.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;Icing on the indie author's cake: &lt;/b&gt;Indie ebook authors earn royalty rates 4-5 times higher than they'd earn from traditional publishers. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Readers don't care about the publisher name&lt;/b&gt; on the ebook's virtual spine.&amp;nbsp; The brand they care about is the author brand. Indie authors are learning to build their own brands.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The growing rift&lt;/b&gt; between writers and publishers will cause the next generation of writers to avoid shopping their books to publishers, and will undermine the goodwill of writers who until now have been loyal to their traditional publishers.&amp;nbsp; Writers are angry.&amp;nbsp; After centuries of living on the bottom rung of the publishing ladder, they're feeling their oats and relishing their new-found power and respect.&amp;nbsp; I wrote about this last week for Publishers Weekly in my opinion piece, &lt;a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/61116-hugh-howey-and-the-indie-author-revolt.html"&gt;Hugh Howey and the Indie Author Revolt &lt;/a&gt;(may require registration).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun with your punditry!&amp;nbsp; I look forward to hearing all views, especially if you don't agree with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;READ NEXT:&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; Read my follow-on to this post,&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/03/indie-ebook-author-community-to-earn.html"&gt;Indie Ebook Author Community to Earn More than Traditional Ebook Authors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

.&amp;nbsp; Please note that the prior web address mentioned in the interview, www.ebookweek.com, is now controlled by a squatter and is not associated with this promotion, so please don't link to or promote the old address.&amp;nbsp;
