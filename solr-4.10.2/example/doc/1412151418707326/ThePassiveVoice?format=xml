				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Publishers Weekly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="article">E-books lost a little bit of sales ground in the third quarter of 2014, according to data from the latest survey of book-buying behavior from Nielsen Books &amp; Consumers. E-books accounted for 21% of unit sales for the year to date through September 30, down from 23% in the January-through-June period. After the first six months of the year, paperbacks represented 42% of units sold; after a slight increase in sales during the third quarter, their share rose to 43%. The hardcover segment’s share of purchases held even at 25%.</p>
<p class="article">The mystery and romance categories had the largest shares of e-book units, at 32% and 36%, respectively, but in both genres paperbacks still accounted for the highest percentage of units sold. In mystery, paperbacks accounted for 37% of purchases; the paperback format took 52% of romance purchases. The Nielsen data also show that e-books lost some of the ground they gained in the young adult category in the first half of 2014, when e-books were 30% of unit sales (on the strength of hot sellers, such as the Divergent series, that performed well in the e-book format). By the end of the third quarter, however, e-books were down to 27% of units sold in the young adult segment.</p>
<p class="article">. . . .</p>
<p class="article"> E-commerce outlets, led by Amazon, accounted for 39% of unit purchases at the end of the first six months of 2014, which remained the same through September. Bookstore chains, too, had the same share at the end of both the six-month and nine-month periods, at 21%.</p>
<p class="article">. . . .</p>
<p class="article"> The Nielsen survey of consumers also found that 57% reported buying their e-books through Amazon in the first nine months of 2014. Amazon’s single closest competitor was BN.com/Nook, which had a 14% share of unit e-book purchases through the first nine months of the year. Apple had only a 6% share.</p>

<blockquote><p>What do Beethoven and the violinist who plays in the subway for a few dollars of tips share? What’s common between Vincent Van Gogh and the spraycan-wielding graffiti artists who paint the walls of your city with their bold artwork? Creativity? Yes, but the similarities go deeper. According to scientists and psychologists, these artists share a set or two of similar “creativity” genes.<span id="more-17836"></span></p>
<p>Creative people are wired differently to their non-creative brethren. The difference is not only in the presence or absence of certain genes but also in the structural characteristics of their brains.</p>
<p>For decades, scientists have been tinkering with the idea that genes may have a role to play in developing creative abilities in individuals. The association described above was suggested in a study of 300,000 people with mental illnesses carried out by scientists at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. According to the results of this study, people suffering from severe neuropsychiatric illnesses like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia tend to display enhanced creativity compared to mentally healthy individuals. A significant percentage of the mentally ill subjects in this study were engaged in creative and artistic professions. The study discovered that their first-degree healthy relatives were also more likely to be engaged in creative occupations. This suggests that although mental illness may not be hereditary, creative genes may run in families.</p>
<p>These findings add more fuel to the “nature versus nurture” debate, but the scientists do not negate the role of nurturing in developing creativity in individuals. They just claim some people are born more creatively-endowed than others.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Recently, a study was carried out on members from five multigenerational families and 172 unrelated individuals with proven musical aptitude and creativity. The subjects in the study were selected after testing them for their ability to compose, improvise and arrange music as well as judge pitch and timing. This study suggests a link between several genes and musical ability and creativity. The study discovered that individuals with musical abilities had genomic variants or copy number variations (CNVs) — either they did not have some genes or had duplicate copies.</p>
<p>Incidentally, CNVs have been linked to the cognitive performance of individuals suffering from neuropsychiatric disorders. The findings from another study indicate the role of CNVs in increasing the risks of a person developing bipolar affective disorder or schizophrenia. Does this surprise you? After all, the belief that geniuses are mad is quite popular.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Several other scientific studies indicate the positive association between the structure of the brain, the goings-on in there, and creative genius in individuals.</p>
<p>A study by scientists at the Cornell University found that creative individuals like artists, musicians, and writers tend to have a peculiarity in the structure of their brains — they have a smaller mass of corpus callosum. The corpus callosum is a cluster of nerve fibers that connect the two hemispheres of the brain.</p>
<p>But scientists and psychologists are not surprised by these findings, and they have an explanation.</p>
<p>Creative individuals are characterized by their ability to think out-of-the-box. It is essentially <em>divergent thinking </em>that lets them explore many different solutions and connect the dots to come up with innovative and creative ideas. A smaller corpus callosum decreases the connectivity between the right and left hemispheres of the brain. Left to itself, each hemisphere gets the chance to specialize, so ideas can develop more freely and fully. The scientists call this process “incubation of ideas.”</p>
<p>After poking and prodding around the brain to find answers, scientists have discovered more brain features linked to creative ability. The brains of creative individuals tend to show increased gray matter especially in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) region, an area that is associated with awareness. More gray matter is linked to increased intelligence.</p>
<p>The study also found evidence that creative individuals tend to have elevated serotonin levels in their brains due to their particular genetic make-up. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that increases connectivity between cells.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the New York Times&#8217; Bits blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text">Philip K. Dick’s “The Man in the High Castle” is about what the title character calls the “terribly, terribly disruptive” nature of reality, so it is awesome that the terribly, terribly disruptive Amazon has now filmed this classic science fiction tale. The pilot will appear early next year from Amazon Studios. Any member of the Amazon Prime perks club can watch it free.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">Nothing in life is truly free, of course, even from Internet companies that proclaim their generosity. As Amazon loads the benefits on top of Prime — including costly original programming like “High Castle,” older movies, a streaming music service and an e-book lending library — the conventional wisdom is that these customers will return the favor by ordering much more from Amazon. Come for the movie, stay for the vacuum cleaner, diapers and marmalade.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">But there is another, more hidden group paying for “High Castle”: people who buy physical books on Amazon. The retailer’s expansion of Prime benefits, as well as its myriad other projects, appears to be fueled in part by fattened margins on all sorts of books beyond the top best sellers.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">Say, for instance, “High Castle” is terrific and you wanted to read something else by Mr. Dick. There are quite a few novels to choose from and Amazon has them all. But the deals are often less than compelling.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">“Dr. Bloodmoney,” “Confessions of a Crap Artist,” “In Milton Lumky Territory,” “The Penultimate Truth,” “Time Out of Joint,” “A Scanner Darkly” and 15 other Dick novels were all discounted 10 to 17 percent late last week.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">. . . .</p>
<p class="story-body-text"> These are not the sort of bargains that made Amazon into the biggest bookseller in the world. In 2001, the retailer announced with much fanfare that it would discount by 30 percent books selling for $20 or more.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">. . . .</p>
<p class="story-body-text"> Sales boomed. “It’s Adam Smith economics that volume will go up when prices go down,” Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos [said].</p>
<p class="story-body-text">. . . .</p>
<p class="story-body-text">Although Amazon does not reveal its pricing strategy, that blanket 30 percent discount seems a thing of the past. Customers today also pay sales tax in much of the United States, which equates to a price increase of as much as 9 percent.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">Mr. Bezos is apparently now using a different measuring stick than Adam Smith economics. Books are helping pay for the company’s expansion, he suggested in an interview this month.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">. . . .</p>
<p class="story-body-text"> “It’s like we built this lemonade stand 20 years ago,” he said. “It’s become very profitable over time, but we also decided to use our skills to open a hamburger stand and a hot-dog stand and so on.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text">. . . .</p>
<p class="story-body-text"> If Amazon seems to have changed its business practices, its message is still the same. It talks the way it did a decade ago, when it was still relentlessly driving down prices. In the confrontation with the publisher Hachette over e-books last summer, the retailer made the crowd-pleasing point that it was on the side of readers against the fat-cat publishers that wanted to line their pockets.</p>

<p>PG didn&#8217;t check Amazon&#8217;s prices for all the books mentioned in this article, but, for those he did, the author was citing hardcopy prices, not ebooks.</p>
<p>PG speculates that ebooks are much more profitable than hardcopy books for Amazon. Since most indy authors make a large portion of their money from ebook sales, this sounds like a win-win.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Publishers Weekly:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Monday, December 15, Apple will finally get their crack at overturning its 2013 e-book price-fixing judgment, with oral arguments scheduled before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. What are the core arguments that will be pressed before the Second Circuit? What is at stake? And, can Apple succeed in overturning the judgment against them? Here is a short primer:</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p class="article">Monday’s hearing is the main event: this is Apple’s appeal of Judge Denise Cote’s 2013 liability finding, in which the company was found to have conspired with five major publishers (Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin, and Simon &amp; Schuster) to artificially inflate e-book prices.</p>
<p class="article">The 2012 suit alleged that five of the then Big Six publishers, threatened by Amazon’s $9.99 e-book prices,colluded with Apple to simultaneously move the industry to an “agency” model in which the publishers would take control of consumer e-book pricing in conjunction with the 2010 launch of the iPad and the iBookstore.</p>
<p class="article">The five Publisher Defendants settled the charges against them and avoided trial. They admitted no wrongdoing, butrefunded $166 million to e-book consumers, and submitted to two years of Department of Justice sanctions. Apple, however, fought the charges, and, on July 10, 2013, after a two-week trial, Cote found Apple had violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</p>
<p class="article">. . . .</p>
<p>In Apple’s version of events, the company did “nothing more” than “[hear] out” the publishers’ complaints about Amazon and convey its “openness to pricing above $9.99.” Nothing in the evidence, they stress, definitively shows otherwise.</p>
<p>Did Apple exploit the publishers’ desire to blunt Amazon’s pricing? Sure—but at no time, Apple attorneys insist, did Apple knowingly join a conspiracy—it was simply trying to enter the e-book market under “rational” business terms. And its entry into the e-book market ultimately had &#8220;pro-competitive&#8221; effects, helping to dent Amazon&#8217;s 90% share of the e-book market.</p>
<p>“That Apple used the leverage created by market dynamics and the publishers’ well-publicized antipathy toward Amazon to enter the market is quintessential competition,” Apple argued in a July appeal brief, “not conspiracy.”</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Justice counter that Apple did considerably more than “hear out” the publishers—and that Judge Cote got the case exactly right. In the DoJ’s appeal filing, U.S attorneys point out that the evidence against Apple was “overwhelming.” And, despite Apple’s dispute over “isolated pieces of evidence,” the judge “articulated the proper standard, and correctly applied it.”</p>
<p>U.S. attorneys claim they only needed to show there was “sufficient evidence” to enable “a reasonable fact finder to infer that the conspiratorial explanation is more likely than not.” And the volumes of evidence presented in the case, they say, shows that the alleged conspiracy was “more than merely plausible,” but made perfect economic sense: Apple wanted a retail platform for e-books on its new device, the iPad, but did not want to compete with Amazon on price. And the publishers wanted to end Amazon’s low prices, which they believed “devalued” their product.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Lawyers say it will be an uphill battle for Apple. Look at it this way: to win, Apple must lead the Second Circuit to a completely opposite finding than the slam-dunk verdict Judge Cote came to, based on the same evidence, and a single, brief oral argument (each side is allotted just 20 minutes).</p>
<p>Apple’s appeal is also somewhat unusual in that it leans surprisingly hard on Cote&#8217;s reading of the evidence. Appeals generally hinge on legal and procedural errors. But in this case, Apple claims that Cote so abused her discretion that her conclusions are reviewable for “clear error.”Cleveland State University law professor Christopher Sagers, who has followed the case closely, told PW it is “definitely not impossible” that Apple could win. But, in his opinion, Cote’s reading of the evidence is sound, and some key parts of Apple&#8217;s arguments, because they revolve around findings of fact, could be deemed unreviewable.</p></blockquote>

<p>PG thinks Apple will lose its appeal.</p>
<p>However, PG also believes that the outcome of the appeal is irrelevant to the ebook world. Apple has failed as a savior of Big Publishing and high prices for ebooks. In a nutshell, Apple can&#8217;t compete with Amazon in selling ebooks.</p>
<p>At the time the Price-Fix Six hatched its little plot, Apple was going to introduce the iPad and everyone thought it would dominate the ebook world. Although the iPad started off as the only game in town, it&#8217;s not any more. Gartner estimated that Android tablets represented 62% of tablet sales in 2013 while iPad sales were 36% of the tablet market.</p>
<p>Theoretically, Apple could remove Amazon apps from the iTunes store, but doing so would upset iPad owners and accelerate the market decline of the iPad.</p>
<p>So, if the Court of Appeals confirms that Apple illegally fixed prices or decides it didn&#8217;t makes no difference to anyone but Apple. Amazon is the king of ebook sales and is likely to continue that role, at least in the near-term future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From a law school dean via re/code:</p>
<blockquote><p>Being sued by the government under the antitrust laws has historically been a rite of passage for great American companies like Standard Oil, U.S. Steel, DuPont, IBM, AT&amp;T, Microsoft, Intel and Google. Apple is the latest to be inducted into this rarified company. In a 2012 lawsuit, the Justice Department alleged that the Cupertino company conspired with seven book publishers to fix e-book prices. After being found liable by the federal district court in Manhattan in July of 2013, Apple is preparing to argue its case in the court of appeals today, Dec. 15.</p>
<p>Apple should be feeling good about its chances. Although the government’s case has superficial appeal, the record suggests that Apple’s actions may have benefited rather than harmed the welfare of e-book customers.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>First, although the point of a price-fixing conspiracy is generally to increase prices, there is compelling evidence that the shift from a wholesale to an agency model resulted in a decrease in the average prices of e-books. While the prices of premium books that Amazon had previously been selling below cost increased, Apple and B&amp;N’s entry facilitated the vast expansion of the e-book market, including the availability of many new low-cost books. The net effect for consumers was an expansion of choice and variety at lower average prices.</p>
<p>Second, it would be misguided to judge the competitive effects of Apple’s behavior solely based on e-book prices. Amazon was strategically using low, and arguably anticompetitive, e-book prices to entrench the entire Kindle ecosystem. Market entry by new competitive ecosystems like the iPad/iBookstore required disruption of Amazon’s prevailing business model. Consumers undoubtedly benefited immensely from the introduction of the Nook and iPad and their associated online bookstores.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From The Daily Beast:</p>
<blockquote><p>Three weeks ago 24-year-old Zoe Sugg published her first novel, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L01GHO6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00L01GHO6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepasvoi01-20&amp;linkId=LDG6FPOWRVZN3OK4"  target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Girl Online</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=thepasvoi01-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00L01GHO6" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></i>, a YA romance. In the first seven days, it sold more than 78,000 copies, beating the first week sales figures of any author on record, including J. K. Rowling and E. L. James.</p>
<p>How was this possible? Well, it can’t have hurt that Sugg is already a celebrity brand in the U.K. (where she lives in the coastal town of Brighton). She began her vlog “Zoella”—hints and tips about beauty, fashion, and lifestyle—in 2009, and has been steadily racking up fans ever since. She is probably the best known of the new “Brit crew” vloggers (she took home the Best British Vlogger Award at the 2013 BBC Radio 1’s Teen Awards, and the Nickelodeon Kid’s Choice Award earlier this year), and each video she posts attracts 12 million hits a month. She has more than 6 million YouTube followers, and 2.62 million on Twitter. Her target audience is teenage girls; thus, as with so much teenage culture that seems to exist on something of a parallel plane to the rest of us, if you’re not a teenage girl yourself (or don’t have a teenage daughter/sister), you’ve most likely never heard of her. Well, until now, that is.</p>
<p><i>Girl Online</i>’s record-breaking sales immediately caused waves, but then Sugg hit the news again this past weekend when it was confirmed by her publishers, Penguin, that the rumors about the possibility that all was not what it seemed with the book were true. The truth was out: Sugg had worked with a ghost writer.</p>
<p>One could argue that this was never exactly hidden from her readers. The ghost writer in question is assumed to be one Siobhan Curham—an established author of both YA and adult fiction. Neither she nor Penguin have confirmed her involvement, or detailed exactly how much ghost writing was involved, but she initially came under suspicion due to Sugg’s mention of her in the acknowledgements of the book: “I want to thank everyone at Penguin for helping me put together my first novel,” she writes, in an admittedly slightly odd turn of phrase—note the use of “put together,” there’s no actual mention of “writing”—“especially Amy Alward [her editor] and Siobhan Curham who were with me every step of the way.” Apparently Curham also posted a blog post back in the summer claiming she had just accepted a job ghost writing a YA novel, a rush job due to be completed in a matter of weeks (now assumed to be <i>Girl Online</i>). The post was later removed.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Quite why anyone is as shocked and surprised by this “revelation” as some are claiming, is beyond me. Even having watched only a handful of the Zoella vlogs, the minute I began reading <i>Girl Online </i>I noticed the vast difference between the friendly, gregarious but ultimately rambling tone of the videos (although I’m well aware the style of a vlog is supposed to be chatty, and thus inherently different to that of the written word), and the sleek, polished style of the novel. But there’s also the seemingly hugely overlooked fact that this is what celebrities do. They hire other people to write their books for them, whether memoir or fiction. Sugg is certainly not the first person to do this, and she won’t be the last either.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the Washington Post blog, The Switch:</p>
<blockquote><p>Edward Snowden on Friday evening called on Amazon.com, one of the world’s largest retailers, to provide routine encryption for its customers to prevent governments from snooping on the reading habits of their citizens.</p>
<p>Snowden, appearing by video link at a surveillance symposium at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, called Amazon’s practice of allowing customers to browse for books and other goods without encryption “morally irresponsible.”</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Amazon, whose founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, encrypts transactions as customers enter their credit card information and other purchase details. But searches for products occur in what experts call “plain text,” meaning governments and others with access to Internet traffic can monitor those searches. That includes Internet providers, employers when people use computers at work, or even coffee shops and hotels hosting wifi networks.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>“Wherever you’re at, wherever that jurisdiction is, they can see what books you’re looking at,” Snowden said on a giant video screen at the Cato Institute’s headquarters in downtown Washington. “This is morally irresponsible, and as a business it’s problematic to allow this to continue when we know for a fact that they have the capability to provide for secure communications because as soon as you go to purchase that book, as soon as money’s involved, they turn it over to encryption.”</p>
<p>He added, “Let’s encrypt your browsing habits. Let’s encrypt the world’s library.”</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the Guardian:</p>
<blockquote><p>James Daunt is a bookseller with a penchant for stories (Anna Karenina is one of his favourites), who is also an inveterate risk taker. In 2011, he watched a Russian oligarch named Alexander Mamut make an insane bid for commercial suicide. And then he volunteered to join him.</p>
<p>Mamut’s crazy venture (“Nobody invests in bookshops to make money,” says Daunt) was his bid for Waterstones, then an ailing chain, burdened with several million pounds of debt. Daunt’s reckless career move was to join Mamut as his CEO, a job widely seen as a poisoned chalice. Many Waterstones-watchers predicted various dire scenarios.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, stories have happy endings. And this month, Daunt was able to announce that, finally, Waterstones is about to break even.</p>
<p>The news that, for the first time in a long time, Waterstones is beginning to show signs of modest growth (new shops; new optimism; new markets) is symbolic of a sea-change in the world of books. Whisper it discreetly, but the book is showing signs of making a modest comeback, with British bookselling exhibiting the symptoms of an unfamiliar, fragile optimism.</p>
<p>During the first decade of the new century, this sector cornered the market in gloomy predictions that the end of the world was nigh. The digital revolution, plus Amazon, plus the credit crunch, seemed to add up to a literary apocalypse. There were moments, some CEOs in book publishing now concede, when they could hardly see a commercial way forward. A mood of panic quickly spread, with many dire predictions.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>To demonstrate the resilience of the traditional book in the midst of a changing market, Daunt took the Observer on a tour of his latest shop opening, Waterstones/Hatchards in St Pancras Station, London. “What we have to do,” he says, “is adapt to new market conditions. It’s no longer enough just to stock a lot of new titles.”</p>
<p>Bookselling today is about bright lighting, friendly staff, cleverly designed bookcases that display new hardbacks – yes, hardbacks – to best advantage, an espresso coffee machine behind the checkout counter and finally – how can we put this ? – many unbookish things such as novelty items, jigsaws, games, children’s toys, Paddington bears, greetings cards and upmarket stationery.</p>
<p>“We’ve been through a fairly tumultuous period,” says Daunt, “but it does seem to be settling at last.” At times, he has seemed to be fighting a war on three fronts: the global recession; the surge in e-reading; and the threat of online selling (Amazon). “Occasionally,” he says, “we thought that people were in flight from the physical book. But now I think the book is back.”</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Daunt’s “stabilisation” programme has involved fundamentally rethinking Waterstones. Gone, for instance, is the old tyranny of central buying, the process whereby Bath, Bolton and Blackpool would be instructed by head office which books to order. “We used to be top-down,” says Daunt. “Now it’s all about what’s right for the individual shop and its local market.” Lately, in Waterstones redux, bookshops and their managers have become much more autonomous – independent states within a federal system.</p>
<p>And then there’s the new Waterstones vibe. The chain still has 287 outlets (roughly the same as when Daunt took over) but they have been comprehensively revamped. They are brighter, lighter, and more welcoming. “We are now selling a lot of things that are not books,” says Daunt.</p>
<p>This is not the end of civilisation, but a sign of the times. Reading habits are changing worldwide. The consumer’s use of leisure time is no longer dominated by book-reading. That, says Daunt, means “we have to rethink what a good bookshop should be”.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From author Rowena Macdonald via Glimmertrain:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many writers say they find writing dialogue difficult, which I always find surprising, as, without wishing to sound self-aggrandizing, dialogue is the one aspect of writing I find easy. To me, it isn&#8217;t that impressive to find dialogue easy. After all, we are primarily verbal creatures, we are surrounded by conversation every day, and most of us spend more time watching films and TV than we do reading books. I am always far more impressed by writers who are able to craft complicated plots, for example, since this is an aspect of writing I find difficult. To my mind, plotting is a superior skill because it isn&#8217;t something that occurs in reality: events don&#8217;t pan out in a neat, compelling sequence, loose ends are not neatly tied up and much of life is mundane, unsymbolic and random.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>1. Read it aloud. If it doesn&#8217;t sound natural, it isn&#8217;t. Make sure it sounds different from prose. Remember, few people talk in complete sentences.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>4. Don&#8217;t write out &#8220;ums&#8221; and &#8220;ers.&#8221; They are realistic, but they look cartoonish in a piece of literature. Instead, use ellipses to give the impression of pauses or uncertainty. Ellipses can also be used at the start and end of dialogue, when someone has been talking for a while and is likely to go on awhile, to give the impression of the other characters tuning out.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>6. If writing dialogue for a character with a specific accent, don&#8217;t write it out phonetically, as this can look patronizing and old-fashioned. Use odd syntax and a few choice bits of slang to convey their accent.</p>
