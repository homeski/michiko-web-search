				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the common myths about a story&#8217;s theme is that it must also be the story&#8217;s &#8220;moral&#8221; or &#8220;message.&#8221; Because theme always deals with fundamental truths that inevitably affect human morality, it&#8217;s easy to assume a story&#8217;s theme must always be specific and applicable to the readers.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t necessarily a false assumption. As we&#8217;ve discussed in previous posts, <a title="Want a Powerful Theme for Your Novel? Play Devil’s Advocate!" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/11/powerful-theme-2.html" target="_blank">theme <em>is</em> about raising questions and suggesting answers</a> that make people think about how to live their lives more honestly and, even, morally. However, there is a major problem with the assumption that theme is a didactic message, designed to <em>teach</em> people how to <em>specifically</em> enact the thematic principle in their own lives.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Think about it this way. If we create stories that <em>tell</em> people how to put the theme to work in their own, very individual lives, then we&#8217;re going to have to be writing story situations that apply to the vast majority of humans. Right away, you can see how such a story must become frustratingly vague (and boring). Worse, amidst all that vagueness, it&#8217;s pretty hard to hide your moralizing intent.</p>
<p>In middle school, I had to read stories about a group of kids who did generic, kid-like things (mowing the lawn, finding money, attending birthday parties). Every story ended with the kids learning some important lesson. The problem (which is still vivid in my mind all these years later) was that this approach&#8211;however spot-on in its intent&#8211;was more about the story&#8217;s <em>message</em> than its theme.</p>
<h2>The Difference Between Your Story&#8217;s Theme and Its Message</h2>
<p>So what&#8217;s the difference? Let&#8217;s make this easy:</p>
<p><strong>Theme is a general principle. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Message is a specific example of that theme in action.</strong></p>
<p>(And, yeah, I know I said the problem with a story&#8217;s message is that it was <em>vague</em>, not specific, but I&#8217;ll explain that in a sec.)</p>
<p>Theme is big stuff. Theme is justice and mercy. Theme is do unto thy neighbor. Theme is joy, peace, and love.</p>
<p><em>Message</em>, on the other hand, is found in the specific story situations that <em>illustrate</em> the thematic principles. Your message is your story’s theme in action.</p>
<p>When your character is working through his character arc, <a title="Creating Stunning Character Arcs, Pt. 2: The Lie Your Character Believes" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/02/character-arcs-2.html" target="_blank">headed away from his Lie and toward the new Truth of the theme</a>, the plot events that act upon him and force him to take action are where we find the message. The very specificity of these story situations (just like those we encounter in real life) means whatever aspect of the theme the character is encountering in that moment is probably just a tiny piece of it. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y26XXA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002Y26XXA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=RGY5KCZDID3HYAQ6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Dramatica</em></a>, Melanie Anne Phillips and Chris Huntley explain:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;we know that characters often work not toward the real solution but to a perceived solution. And characters frequently grapple with a problem that is ultimately recognized as only a symptom of the real problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>If your theme is justice and mercy, then your story&#8217;s message will probably be something much smaller and more specific to your characters, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I8V0Q8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004I8V0Q8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=A2VZWQDRXUJA3KJY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mattie Ross</a>&#8216;s &#8220;justice is worth having, even if you must chase it down at the risk of your own life.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Robert-Duvall-Kim-Darby-True-Grit-Henry-Hathaway-1969.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7969 aligncenter" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Robert-Duvall-Kim-Darby-True-Grit-Henry-Hathaway-1969.jpg" alt="Robert Duvall (Ned Pepper)  and his gang capture Kim Darby (Mattie Ross), and he forces Cogburn and Le Boeuf to abandon the girl." width="478" height="268" /></a></p>
<h2>Theme Is Inclusive, Message Is Exclusive</h2>
<p>The most important difference to understand about theme and message is that theme is <em>inclusive</em> and message is <em>exclusive</em>. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C2C8XSU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00C2C8XSU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=E7DBIQMCHTMSXTOM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Writing Screenplays That Sell</em></a>, Michael Hauge posits:</p>
<blockquote><p>Theme is also not the same as message. A <em>message</em>, by my definition, is a political statement. It is a principle that concerns people in a particular situation and is not universally applicable to any member of the audience.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, theme applies to everyone; message applies only to the characters and their specific situation. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00170F0DE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00170F0DE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=H4A5CREJY5Y2BXJA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Spider-Man</em></a>, the theme is &#8220;with great power comes great responsibility,&#8221; but the message is that responsibility means donning spandex and fighting bad guys. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I9YV2Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000I9YV2Q&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=PNGWED3TBFIKW3FD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Spider-Man 2</em></a>, the theme is that we all have the potential to be heroic, but the message is that, in order to be heroic, &#8221; you have to be steady and give up the thing you want the most.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think we can all agree &#8220;with great power comes great responsibility&#8221; is a universal truth. It applies to you, me, and Kim Jong Un just as much as it does Spidey. But whatever power we may possess, it&#8217;s unlikely we&#8217;re going to exercise our responsibility for it by becoming hooded vigilantes. The story&#8217;s <em>message</em> is too specific to apply to us or most other viewers: it&#8217;s exclusive to people bitten by radioactive spiders.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Tobey-Maguire-Spider-Man-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7970" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Tobey-Maguire-Spider-Man-2.jpg" alt="Tobey Maguire Spider-Man 2" width="420" height="315" /></a></p>
<p>But the theme? Ah, yes, that&#8217;s inclusive. It applies to all of us&#8211;and that&#8217;s why audiences resonated so strongly with what might otherwise have been nothing but a story about a human spider in tights.</p>
<h2>If Message Is So Specific, How Come I Said It Will Create a Vague Story?</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the post, I talked about how the problem with stories that focus on <em>message</em> rather than <em>theme</em> is that they end up too vague. But how does that work if message is <em>more</em> specific than theme?</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t with message in general. You <em>want</em> your story to have a message. You can&#8217;t have a theme without a message, since your message is the vehicle on which your story&#8217;s theme will reach your readers.</p>
<p>The problem is when you try to make your message <em>into </em>your theme.</p>
<p>Remember those middle-grade stories I talked about? The message and the theme were exactly the same: Billy found some money, wanted to keep it, then realized the right thing to do would be to find the owner and give it back. It&#8217;s a message that applies to kids everywhere, not just Billy. The message isn&#8217;t <em>more</em> specific than its theme; it <em>is</em> the theme. The result is a message that&#8217;s too on the nose to avoid moralizing, and a story situation that&#8217;s too vague to create any real curiosity or interest in readers.</p>
<h2>How Do You Find the Right Message for Your Story&#8217;s Theme?</h2>
<p><a title="Don’t Know Your Story’s Theme? Take a Look at Your Character’s Arc" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/11/storys-theme.html" target="_blank">Chances are your theme will arise out of your message rather than the other way around.</a> Most stories start with their characters stuck in a situation, rather than with a theme that then needs a situation to illustrate it.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s important to remember is that the two are integrally linked. The theme creates the message&#8211;or vice versa. Whatever your story&#8217;s <em>exclusive</em> message is, it must be an illustration of your <em>inclusive</em> theme. When Phillips and Huntley tell us &#8220;theme will not be a universal meaning for all things, but a smaller truth pertaining to the proper way of dealing with a particular situation,&#8221; that &#8220;smaller truth&#8221; they&#8217;re talking about is the message.</p>
<p>Consider a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KSW5WI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005KSW5WI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=JWKR5GU3RIWSCTHM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Secondhand Lions</em></a>&#8216; <strong>theme</strong> is having faith in people. Its <strong>message</strong> is that sometimes it&#8217;s better to believe in things because they&#8217;re worth believing in, rather than because they&#8217;re actually true.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LLOOSWA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00LLOOSWA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=IKX6W327T5XCUC7M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Jane Eyre</em></a>&#8216;s <strong>theme</strong> is self-worth. Its <strong>message</strong> is that even a great love isn&#8217;t worth enslaving your soul.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC0SH8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000FC0SH8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=ZIGA2HDOG3X4DRRJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>The Old Man and the Sea</em></a>&#8216;s <strong>theme</strong> is that courage and endurance are their own reward. Its <strong>message</strong> is that trying and failing to bring in a giant swordfish will be more validating than giving up a losing fight.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Second-Hand-Lions-Jane-Eyre-Old-Man-and-the-Sea.png" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7972" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Second-Hand-Lions-Jane-Eyre-Old-Man-and-the-Sea.png" alt="Second Hand Lions Jane Eyre Old Man and the Sea" width="600" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Only once you&#8217;ve identified your story&#8217;s message can you use it to bring to life your story&#8217;s theme in the most powerful, integrated, and subtextual way possible. Put the two together, and you&#8217;ll have a powerhouse story that will avoid all the common myths about theme as the &#8220;moral of the story.&#8221; Try it out!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All creative writers must strike that terrible balance between the needs of the characters and the needs of the plot. It’s a wretched ping-pong game sometimes, and we can feel as if one will win over the other. But deep down we know it shouldn’t be that way. <a title="Plot vs. Character: Which Is More Important?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2010/02/plot-vs-character-which-is-more.html" target="_blank">The elements of character and plot are not in competition</a> with each other. Each have their own needs and until we realize that fact, the struggle will go on. Let&#8217;s examine the secret to harmonizing character and plot&#8211;by writing a protagonist who&#8217;s both unique and universal.</p>
<h2>Characters Are Individual</h2>
<p>Few things are worse that two-dimensional characters. If there is nothing interesting about the people in your stories, it doesn’t matter how dynamite your plots are. If your people are boring, it is inevitable your writing will be as well.</p>
<p>Your characters are at their best when they are as unique as possible. They have physical quirks, as well as psychological. They have <a title="Most Common Writing Mistakes: Weak Character Voice" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/12/common-mistakes-one-symptom-weak-character-voice.html" target="_blank">a particular vocabulary and speech pattern</a>. Each and every character has a well-defined worldview and a <a title="Why Your Character’s Motive Matters" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2010/07/why-your-characters-motive-matters.html" target="_blank">personal motivation for their actions</a>. Everything about them is as detailed and finely tuned as possible.</p>
<h2>Stories Are Universal</h2>
<p>In contrast to your &#8220;narrow&#8221; characters, stories need to be as broad as humanity. In particular, I have in mind theme. <a title="Want a Powerful Theme for Your Novel? Play Devil’s Advocate!" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/11/powerful-theme-2.html" target="_blank">The theme is <em>why</em> we are writing our particular stories.</a> Themes within a given tale can be about such things as sacrificing one’s self for a greater good, perseverance in the face or failure and defeat, or the short-term value of beauty or wealth.</p>
<p>Your characters should be as individual as snowflakes, but the themes of your stories need to be as absolute as the snowstorm.</p>
<h2>There Is Only One Story</h2>
<p>Allow me to let you in on a little secret that all creative writers should know: there is only one story.</p>
<p>That one story is about what it is like to live as a human in this world.</p>
<p>Just as all people are different, all people are just the same. We all have the same struggles and obstacles in life. we share the same joys and pleasures in this world. If your stories do not  tap into these shared struggles and joys, readers will not find a connection to your work.</p>
<p>The best stories are those with interesting people doing interesting things. To write such a story, you need well-written characters and meaningful plots. You need characters and stories that are not in conflict with each other, but that complement each other. Each have their own needs. If your characters are as unique and particular as they can be, and if your stories are as real and human as they can be, you will end up with a compelling tale readers will cherish.</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: How do you go about writing a protagonist to make him both relatable and interesting?</strong></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year, I find myself reading with the maniac intensity of someone who believes it might be the last reading year. (I like to turn everything into an extreme sport.) After all, what self-respecting writer doesn&#8217;t study at the feet of the masters as much as she can?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best character development is often found in the heart of his personal narrative: his introspective observations and reactions to the events of the story. As I&#8217;ve preached many a time, if a character&#8217;s not <em>reacting </em>to what&#8217;s happening in your story, then what&#8217;s happening doesn&#8217;t matter. But the irony here is that the eternal balancing act of the writer leads us to yet another of the most common writing mistakes: too <em>much</em> introspection.</p>

They&#8217;re the single greatest <a title="What You Need to Know About Writing Novels in the Age of Movies" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2009/03/movie-factor.html" target="_blank">advantage of written fiction over other narrative artforms</a>. The ability to get inside a character&#8217;s head and see the world from his unique viewpoint is what brings life to great stories&#8211;everything from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316769487/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316769487&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=UBFB4DY4INPGM54W" target="_blank"><em>Catcher in the Rye</em></a> to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I8V0Q8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004I8V0Q8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=RANXK2OBU7C2RLOV" target="_blank"><em>True Grit</em></a> to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QTE9WU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000QTE9WU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=UWBRCG5E3L6XZZXI" target="_blank"><i>Poisonwood Bible</i></a>.

<p>But introspection can never take the place of interaction. When you end up with characters doing more observing than acting, that&#8217;s often (although definitely not always) a sign <a title="Most Common Writing Mistakes: Are You Skipping the Best Parts?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2012/10/most-common-writing-mistakes-18.html" target="_blank">you&#8217;re avoiding the best parts of your story</a>.</p>
<h2>How to Bore Readers With Too Much Introspection</h2>
<p>There you are, writing an epic romance&#8211;the relationship story of all relationship stories. Your hero and heroine are super-duper charming and fascinating. Their chemistry zings right off the page. Your readers can&#8217;t <em>wait </em>for them to get together. But, first, naturally, comes the part where they have to work through all their reasons for <em>not</em> being together. Conflict and obstacles ensue. Otherwise, the story ends, right?</p>
<p>So you figure your characters better do a lot of thinking about this possible new romance of theirs. After all, there <em>is</em> a lot to think about. They&#8217;ve both got <a title="Improve Your Character Instantly: Just Add a Ghost" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/10/improve-your-character-instantly-just.html" target="_blank">backstory baggage</a> to work through, fears to overcome, and, of course, doubts about whether or not the other person returns their feelings. If you don&#8217;t logic through all this stuff, then readers won&#8217;t feel the progression of the relationship, and <a title="How Authors Kill Suspension of Disbelief by Calling Attention to Themselves" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/12/authors-kill-suspension-of-disbelief.html" target="_blank">their suspension of disbelief might be endangered</a>.</p>
<p>So you have Mr. Hero ponder everything happening to him:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Romeo stood in the stable door and watched Juliet feeding the chickens. Gosh, but she was beautiful. That glorious golden hair. Those huge violet eyes. He thumped his fist against his heart. But, alas, who was he but a poor servant boy&#8211;and wanted by the law to boot.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Juliet peeked up at him from under the lavender kerchief that tied back her hair. She batted her eyes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">His heart flipped over in his chest. If only&#8211;! But, no, he could never endanger her chances for a better match or put her in the way of his enemies. He would have to hold his peace and keep his great love to himself. He went back to mucking out the stalls.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Romeo_and_Juliet_detail_by_Frank_Dicksee.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7847" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Romeo_and_Juliet_detail_by_Frank_Dicksee.png" alt="Romeo and Juliet Frank Dicksee" width="307" height="249" /></a></p>
<h2>How to Rivet Readers With the Right Amount of Character Interaction</h2>
<p>Right about now, I&#8217;m wanting to grab Romeo by his ruffed collar and tell to stop wasting my time with his mooning. His attraction to Juliet is important info, and his concerns about the feasibility of their relationship do him credit. But frankly, I don&#8217;t care. I get the picture already! Let&#8217;s get down to the good stuff, shall we? You know&#8211;the talking, the flirting, the arguing, the occasional face slapping, the <em>interaction</em>.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, most good stories are going to be <a title="It’s What Your Characters Do That Defines Them" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2009/08/its-what-your-characters-do-that.html" target="_blank">about characters <em>doing</em> something</a>. Most readers would rather it be sooner than later. By the third time the character <em>thinks</em> about talking to the other character, readers are going to want to skip ahead to the part where the talking actually starts happening.</p>
<p>Largely, the cure for this thirty-sixth of our most common writing mistakes harks back to one of my favorite bits of writing advice: &#8220;<a title="Skip the Boring Parts" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2010/08/skip-boring-parts.html" target="_blank">Skip the boring parts!</a>&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/USE-UP.png"><img class="wp-image-7846 aligncenter" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/USE-UP.png" alt="I try to leave out the parts people skip Elmer Leonard" width="410" height="410" /></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s give Romeo a second chance shall we?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Romeo stood in the stable door and watched Juliet feeding the chickens. &#8220;Gosh, but you&#8217;re&#8211;&#8221; <em>Beautiful</em>. He wanted to tell her she was beautiful. But, no, that would lead them both places he couldn&#8217;t let them go.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">She straightened and stared him in the eye. &#8220;Gosh, but I&#8217;m <em>what?</em>&#8220;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He cleared his throat. &#8220;Late. Those chickens have been squawking for hours.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;That is <em>not</em> what you were going to say.&#8221; She sauntered over. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just tell me the truth for once?&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;I&#8217;d like to&#8211;but I can&#8217;t.&#8221; The truth would get them both killed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Was that disappointment that flickered across her face?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nope, she tilted that pert nose to the sky. &#8220;You&#8217;re right. You&#8217;re just a stable boy. You shouldn&#8217;t even be talking to me.&#8221; She spun on her heel and stomped back past the chickens.</p>
<p>Ahhh, that&#8217;s much more interesting. Not only did we get to skip that fat lot of <em>nothing</em> happening in the first example, but, in its place, we got to add conflict, dialogue, subtext, and some juicy hints about our character&#8217;s past and motivations. What&#8217;s not to like?</p>
<h2>When You <em>Should</em> Use Introspection</h2>
<p>Naturally, I&#8217;ve got to add a caveat in here. Don&#8217;t take Romeo&#8217;s misadventures as a warning against <em>all</em> introspection/character thoughts/internal monologues/narrative. Narrative is a crucial part of any story. It <em>is</em> vital to character development and advancing the causality and <a title="How Much Realism Does Your Novel REALLY Need?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/11/much-realism-novel-really-need.html" target="_blank">realism of your story</a>. Very likely, Romeo&#8217;s original line of thinking would fit into the right story without ever slowing readers down.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also true some stories are <em>meant</em> to be more introspective than active. Many a literary classic is all about the character&#8217;s thoughts rather than his actions. But for most popular novels, you&#8217;re going to want to make sure you&#8217;ve properly balanced the two.</p>
<p>Consider your work-in-progress. Is your character thinking about what he should do more than he&#8217;s doing it? Are there lengthy passages in which he&#8217;s going over (and over and over) things in his mind, <a title="The Cure-All for Long and Boring Narrative" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2011/08/cure-all-for-long-and-boring-narrative.html" target="_blank">rather than discussing them with another character</a>, or simply working them out as he goes? It&#8217;s possible these introspection-heavy scenes of yours are just fine as they are. But it&#8217;s also possible you might double your literary investment by lighting a fire under your character and forcing him into action.</p>
<h3> <strong>Tell me your opinion: How have you balanced your narrator&#8217;s introspection with his interaction?</strong></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently found myself in the &#8220;writing&#8221; subreddit, offering my two cents in the discussion. One of the questions that seemed to ring a bell with a few writers was, “<em>Why can’t I bring myself to edit?”</em> Writing seemed to be the easy part. Editing your book? Not so much.</p>
<p>Here at <a title="CompletelyNovel" href="http://completelynovel.com/" target="_blank">CompletelyNovel</a>, we find that editing makes all the difference when publishing a book. It’s what puts your work in the same league as the books on your bookshelf. If you dread editing, it can help to think of it in the same way as you do your writing. Both writing and editing are as much about creativity as they are about discipline and planning.</p>
<p>Below are some of the top tips I’ve picked up to manage and, dare I say it, even make editing enjoyable!</p>
<h2>1. Set Yourself Targets for Writing and Editing Your Book</h2>
<p>Rather than steaming straight into editing, spend some time planning. <a title="The Ridiculously Surefire Way to Write the Perfect Novel" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2008/07/making-of-perfect-novel.html" target="_blank">Take lessons from your writing routine</a>.</p>
<p>Do you prefer to write in the morning, or in the evening?</p>
<p>Do you need solitude, or can you freely scribble away in a noisy café?</p>
<p>You may set yourself a word limit to reach each day. Setting achievable goals keep you motivated to put pen to paper. A thousand words you’re not proud of is better than no words at all, after all.</p>
<p>You can use the same ideas to plan your editing. Again, consider the way you write.</p>
<p>Do you find that you run out of steam quickly? Then you might find it useful to schedule in an editing day after several days of writing.</p>
<p>Or maybe you prefer to write the whole thing first and edit after? That’s okay, just remember to break your editing into achievable goals like you did your writing. Editing a thousand words a day sounds much more doable than editing the entire novel.</p>
<h2>2. Understand Editing Your Book Comes in Different Forms</h2>
<p>There are three well-known stages of editing:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1.</strong> Structural.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2.</strong> Copyediting.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3.</strong> Proofreading.</p>
<p>Each is equally important, and they work best in that order.</p>
<h3>Structural Editing</h3>
<p>Our <a title="Get Your Book Fit" href="https://www.udemy.com/get-your-book-fit/?couponCode=GYBF15" target="_blank">Get Your Book Fit</a> sums up structural editing really well. Structural editing focuses on the basic elements of storytelling, things such as narrative drive, <a title="5 Ways to Pace Your Story" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2009/07/5-ways-to-pace-your-story.html" target="_blank">pacing</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EJX08QA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00EJX08QA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20" target="_blank">structure</a>, and <a title="3 Ways to Make Your POVs Equally Interesting" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/03/3-ways-to-make-your-povs-equally.html" target="_blank">point of view</a>.</p>
<h3>Copyediting</h3>
<p>Copyediting on the other hand, is about polishing the surface: correcting mistakes in <a title="Most Common Writing Mistakes: 10 Stylistic Mistakes Sabotaging Your Story" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2011/08/most-common-mistakes-series-10.html" target="_blank">usage</a>, continuity, <a title="Are You Guilty of These 8 Common Grammar Mistakes?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2011/02/guilty-8-common-grammar-mistakes.html" target="_blank">grammar</a>, and style.</p>
<h3>Proofreading</h3>
<p>Proofreading is the very last stage of editing&#8211;<a title="Never Miss a Typo Again" href="http://authorculture.blogspot.com/2010/02/never-miss-typo-again.html" target="_blank">identifying and correcting all the remaining errors</a>. There’s no use spending months correcting typos only to realize you need to rewrite half the book for it to make sense structurally, after all!</p>
<h2>3. Edit With Fresh Perspective</h2>
<p>Don’t underestimate the importance of giving your mind a rest between writing and editing. Stephen King famously leaves six weeks between writing and editing his manuscript. Again, how much time you need depends on how you work. Some writers take a few days and some take a few weeks.</p>
<h2>4. Improve Your Line Editing</h2>
<p>This can be a bit time consuming, but rest assured it is time well invested. Separate your sentences and think about whether each of them makes sense both on its own and within a wider context. Look closely at <a title="5 Key Ways to Choose the Right Word (Without a Thesaurus!)" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/11/5-key-ways-to-choose-the-right-word.html" target="_blank">your choice of words</a> and get rid of any phrases or words that are unnecessary or cliché.</p>
<p>I’ve found line editing is easier on a computer. Isolate every sentence on a separate line and use double spacing so you can clearly see the length and pacing of each sentence. Read the sentence out loud to discover how it flows and whether any words are jarring.</p>
<h2>5. Print Your Manuscript</h2>
<p>No, I’m not going to tell you off for preferring screen to paper, but printing a draft of your novel can be a useful process for spotting further mistakes. Words look different on a printed page. Plus, it’s nice to give your eyes a break. Shut down the computer, do some eye yoga (yes, really), and embrace that red pen as your best friend.</p>
<p>Remember, no book was ever published without editing. Sit back, unleash the red pen, cram your mouth full of cake, and enjoy yourself. Your book will be all the better for it!</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: What is your greatest challenge in editing your book?</strong></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the thing about a powerful theme. It&#8217;s not black and white. It&#8217;s not the moral of the story. It&#8217;s not an answer&#8211;it&#8217;s a question. And here&#8217;s the thing about questions: they very often have more than one answer.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re writing a story that asks a simple little question like, &#8220;Is lying bad?&#8221; That seems pretty black and white, yeah? But what about when the Mafia hitman walks up to your door and asks if your debt-ridden old man is home? He&#8217;s in the living room hiding under the coffee table, hyperventilating. But you look Mr. Hitman in the eye and swear up and down that Dad moved to Cali. Was that down-and-dirty lie a bad thing?</p>
<p>Truth isn&#8217;t subjective, but our individual takes on it are and its applicability in varying situations definitely is. As the Chinese proverb says,</p>
<blockquote><p>There are three truths. My truth, your truth, and the truth.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re ever going to write a compelling theme (and, by extension, a compelling story), this is the <em>one</em> principle of storytelling you have to realize. You can&#8217;t present readers with <em>your</em> truth straight up and <a title="How to Send a Message in Your Story… Without Preaching" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/05/message-in-your-story.html" target="_blank">expect them to not feel preached at</a>&#8211;much less swallow it for themselves.</p>
<h2>The Idea of Theme Makes Some Authors Uncomfortable&#8211;This Is Why</h2>
<p>Within some writing circles, theme has something of a bad name. Writers wrinkle their noses at the word, as if it&#8217;s kind of smelly. Theme is <em>preachy</em>. Theme is what Aesop&#8217;s fables give us. Theme is about evangelizing readers to a specific viewpoint&#8211;and readers <em>hate</em> that.</p>
<p>And yet writers are also told (like I&#8217;ve been telling you these last few weeks) that <a title="Don’t Know Your Story’s Theme? Take a Look at Your Character’s Arc" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/11/storys-theme.html" target="_blank">a powerful theme is crucial to a successful story</a>. So&#8217;s how that work?</p>
<p>The key, of course, is the word &#8220;powerful.&#8221; We only get a powerful theme when we understand that preaching actually weakens theme. Claiming a rock-solid viewpoint and screaming it in the readers&#8217; faces <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> equal a powerful theme. It&#8217;s very unmoveableness is what weakens it. Theme isn&#8217;t the brittle rock in the middle of the river: it&#8217;s the water that keeps on moving, always searching.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/FOLLOW.png"><img class=" wp-image-7771 aligncenter" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/FOLLOW.png" alt="Be water, my friend. Bruce Lee Quote" width="366" height="366" /></a></p>
<p>But then that sounds kinda wishy-washy, doesn&#8217;t it? How do you present a solid theme <em>without</em> standing behind your moral viewpoint 100%?</p>
<h2>Point and Counterpoint: Convince Readers of Your Theme by <em>Not</em> Convincing Them</h2>
<p>If your purpose of writing a novel is to convince readers of <em>your</em> truth, then you&#8217;re probably working in the wrong medium. Better buy a podium or a pulpit (or a blog!). But if you&#8217;re interested in <em>sharing</em> your truth and raising interesting questions about it, then you&#8217;re in the right place.</p>
<p>Theme is about exploration. But you can&#8217;t explore unless you&#8217;re willing to step out of the tour bus and visit some dark places. In other words, you have to be willing to look at the exact opposite of your theme&#8217;s posited truth and explore it just as earnestly and honestly as if you believed it. For every point you raise to support the thematic premise you&#8217;ve chosen, you&#8217;ll have to raise an equally honest and probing counterpoint. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y26XXA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002Y26XXA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=4Y43IRBIMWA3YURZ" target="_blank"><em>Dramatica</em></a>, <span class="a-size-small a-color-secondary">Melanie Anne Phillips and </span><span class="a-size-small a-color-secondary">Chris Huntley explain:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y26XXA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002Y26XXA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=N47R7WSRWHT42FXZ" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-7770 size-medium" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Dramatica-Melanie-Anne-Phillips-Chris-Huntley-210x300.jpg" alt="Dramatica Melanie Anne Phillips Chris Huntley" width="210" height="300" /></a>Both Issue and counterpoint must be played against one another over the course of the story if the author is to make a case that one is better than the other.</p></blockquote>
<p>Favoritism has no place in a powerful theme. Why? Because your readers will sniff it out in a second and instinctively discount your truth a little bit, both because you&#8217;re obviously prejudiced in presenting it and because they don&#8217;t appreciate your attempts to manipulate them. Robert McKee, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042FZVOY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0042FZVOY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=XW4CFZRWD2GIRJGY" target="_blank"><em>Story</em></a>, hammers it home:</p>
<blockquote><p>In creating the dimensions of your story’s [thematic] “argument,” take great care to build the power of both sides. Compose the scenes and sequences that contradict your final statement with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it. If your [story] ends on the Counter-Idea, such as “Crime pays because…,” then amplify the sequences that lead the audience to feel justice will win out. If your [story] ends on the Idea, such as “Justice triumphs because…,” then enhance the sequences expressing “Crime pays and pays big.” In other words, do not slant your “argument.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Your Powerful Theme Will Arise From Your Ability to See Both Sides</h2>
<p>Some stories will come to you complete with a strong thematic idea. The whole story is <em>about</em> why lying is bad. Your passion about this truth is why you&#8217;re writing this story in the first place. As a result, the idea that you have to explore why lying might <em>not</em> be so bad turns your stomach. McKee again:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042FZVOY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0042FZVOY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=XW4CFZRWD2GIRJGY" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-7172 size-medium" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/robert-mckee-story-200x300.jpg" alt="Story by Robert McKee" width="200" height="300" /></a>As a story develops, you must willingly entertain opposite, even repugnant ideas. The finest writers have dialectical, flexible minds that easily shift points of view. They see the positive, the negative, and all shades of irony, seeking the truth of these views honestly and convincingly. This omniscience forces them to become even more creative, more imaginative, and more insightful.</p></blockquote>
<p>I like to say that if you&#8217;re not <a title="Why You Should Be Writing Scared" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2009/10/why-you-should-be-writing-scared-2.html" target="_blank">writing scared</a>, you&#8217;re not realizing your story&#8217;s full potential&#8211;and this is nowhere more true than of theme. Authors can&#8217;t be complacent. If you&#8217;re unwilling to explore the dark sides of the truths you profess to believe, then you may want to question how strongly you actually believe them. If a theme is true, then its truth will be able to stand stalwartly under even the strongest scrutiny. Even better, it will emerge all the stronger in both your own mind and that of your readers.</p>
<p>Consider every possible objection even the most virulent readers might raise to your thematic premise. Every one of these objections needs to be raised by your characters&#8211;and not just the &#8220;bad&#8221; characters, but the protagonist himself. Take your protagonist down the dark side of your theme and see what you find. Be brutal. Be honest. You, your characters, and your readers will all emerge on the other side having gained more than mere entertainment. For the rest of your lives, you&#8217;ll all carry the things you&#8217;ve learned about this powerful theme.</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: How have you presented a powerful theme by also honestly demonstrating its flip side?</strong></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>He saunters through the fog with a black cape flapping about his heels, shoulders back, chin tucked so he can fix you with a sinister glare. When his eyes catch yours, you can’t help but shudder at the complete lack of compassion or humanity in his gaze. His chuckle sets your skin crawling, and your brain sends panicked signals to your limbs: run, run, run.</em></p>
<p>But something holds you back. A tickle at the back of your mind won’t let you quite believe. Haven’t you met this fellow before—at least a dozen times? And aren’t black capes and maniacal laughs a little passé? Does this embodiment of senseless, delighted evil represent dimensional antagonists&#8211;or will it be nothing more than a host of clichéd villains?</p>
<h2>Dimensional Antagonists&#8211;or Melodramatic Clowns?</h2>
<p>Sometimes those villains we grew up with—the ones who twirled their curly mustaches, smiled “evilly” to show off a gold tooth, or wore black cowboy hats—like to worm their way out of our memories and crawl onto the page to take up residence in our stories.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Snidely-Whiplash-Tying-Nell-to-the-Railroad-Tracks-in-Dudley-Do-Right1.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7787" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Snidely-Whiplash-Tying-Nell-to-the-Railroad-Tracks-in-Dudley-Do-Right1.jpg" alt="Snidely Whiplash Tying Nell to the Railroad Tracks in Dudley Do-Right" width="434" height="296" /></a></p>
<p>But when that happens, we run the risk of creating a robotic villain who exists solely to resist the hero&#8211;or, worse, as some sort of twisted villainous clown whose ineptitude provides nearly as much comic relief as opposition.</p>
<h2>3 Tips for Three-Dimensional Antagonists</h2>
<p>I think it’s fair to assume y’all want to create well-rounded three-dimensional antagonists—instead of cartoon cutouts of villains. Here are a few tips:</p>
<h3>1. Stop Using the Word &#8220;Villain&#8221;</h3>
<p>I know it’s hard <em>not </em>to think to think of our antagonists as villains. <a title="The Moral Villain – and a Giveaway!" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2013/12/moral-villain-giveaway.html" target="_blank">It’s hard <em>not</em> to paint a portrait in black ink without a shred of light to offer contrast</a>. It’s easy to think of excuses for why we <em>should</em> call them villains. After all, don’t they behave like a downright, black-hearted bad guy all the time, and isn’t the author <em>supposed </em>to be on the protagonist’s side?</p>
<p>But then this quote comes to mind:</p>
<blockquote><p>Every villain is a hero in his own mind.&#8211;Tom Hiddleston</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Loki-Riding-Chitauri-Avengers-Climax-Tom-Hiddleston.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7788" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Loki-Riding-Chitauri-Avengers-Climax-Tom-Hiddleston.jpg" alt="Loki Riding Chitauri Avengers Climax Tom Hiddleston" width="463" height="260" /></a></p>
<p>Which brings us to tip number two.</p>
<h3>2. Discover Why Your “Villain” Thinks He Is the Hero</h3>
<p>He does. Honestly. Fervently. Devoutly. Your antagonist believes he is in the right and the hero is in the wrong, and nothing is going to stop him from achieving his goal. (He does have a goal <em>other</em> than stopping the hero, right?)</p>
<p>Once you discover why your antagonist thinks he should be the protagonist, you will <a title="Why Your Character’s Motive Matters" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2010/07/why-your-characters-motive-matters.html" target="_blank">understand his motives</a> for acting the way he does, and perhaps even stumble across some decisions that you never would have expected him to make otherwise.</p>
<h3>3. The Villain Is in the Details</h3>
<p>When I first started writing my fantasy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NG5IEBS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00NG5IEBS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=U22MYPRXP6LYLVPZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Orphan’s Song</em></a>, I plugged in your typical baddie to serve as my main antagonist. Carhartan was harsh, cold, and deadly, and oh didn’t you just love to hate him! But as I dug further into my own revisions, I started playing with his character a little bit more. Added a hint of the tragic, a need for success, a tinge of honor (albeit twisted and misguided).</p>
<p>But he still felt just a tad stiff.</p>
<p>It bothered me to no end.</p>
<p>Until I started revising a scene later in the book where he’s sitting on a hummock of grass in the middle of the wilderness, ragged and travel-stained. An image instantly popped into my head: Aragorn the Ranger as he appears in the movie version of <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Viggo-Mortensen-Aragorn-Pipe.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7793 aligncenter" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Viggo-Mortensen-Aragorn-Pipe.jpg" alt="Viggo Mortensen Aragorn Pipe" width="461" height="262" /></a></p>
<p>No! That wasn’t what I wanted. Carhartan was my <em>villain</em>. Aragorn the Ranger is a very awesome <em>hero</em>. But I followed my gut instinct, bit the bullet, and plopped a pipe into Carhartan’s hand.</p>
<p>Such a tiny, seemingly inconsequential detail, but it instantly humanized Carhartan in my mind. I went back and inserted the pipe into key scenes, and it added the level of reality to Carhartan that had been missing.</p>
<p>As I thought about antagonists and those little details that make them human, another one that sprang to mind was Barbossa from <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl</em> and the apple that he so wanted to eat and enjoy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Barbossa-Apple-Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-Black-Pearl.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7794" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Barbossa-Apple-Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-Black-Pearl.jpg" alt="Barbossa Apple Pirates of the Caribbean Black Pearl" width="383" height="292" /></a></p>
<p>Even in the midst of all his reprehensible actions, you can’t help catching sight of that apple and feeling sorry for him—if only for a moment.</p>
<h2>Humanize Your Antagonist</h2>
<p>When you round it up and add it together, these three tips all aim toward the same thing: humanizing your antagonist. Once you plant these little hints of humanity in your antagonist’s character, you can use them to evoke a twinge of sympathy in the reader, even if your antagonist earns (and deserves) hatred the rest of the time. <a title="Juxtaposition: The Power of the Unexpected in Fiction" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2010/10/juxtaposition-power-of-unexpected-in.html" target="_blank">There is nothing like conflicting emotions</a> to capture readers&#8217; attention and create a memorable antagonist who will stand the test of time. (Though a winning smile and cutting wit can’t hurt either. *Ahem, Loki.*)</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: What are some details that helped you create dimensional antagonists? Do you have a favorite tip on writing three-dimensional antagonists?</strong></h3>

<h2>Video Transcript:</h2>
<p>Imagine this: you’ve created an amazing story, full of amazing characters, who are clashing in an epic conflict. Your story&#8217;s climax has arrived, and, baby, it is tense. You’ve got readers on the edge of their seats. They’re turning those pages so fast they’re getting paper cuts. In other words, you’re doing everything right. <strong>But then—you do something wrong. You cut to a commercial break.</strong> “Don’t you dare touch that dial, folks! We’ll be right back with more exciting mayhem!”</p>
<p>Can you hear it?</p>
<p><em>Pssssssssssst</em>.</p>
<p><strong>That’s your story’s tension and your readers’ excitement deflating like a popped balloon. </strong></p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A735U0U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00A735U0U&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=Y2DEZMORFKNS6QQJ" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-7798 size-full" src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Hunchback-of-Notre-Dame-Book-Cover-by-Victor-Hugo.jpg" alt="Hunchback of Notre Dame Book Cover by Victor Hugo" width="200" height="318" /></a>There’s an especially egregious example of this in the finale of Victor Hugo’s generally wonderful classic <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A735U0U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00A735U0U&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=Y2DEZMORFKNS6QQJ" target="_blank"><em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em></a>. He’s got his story’s climax cranked into high gear as the gypsies attempt to free La Esmeralda by launching a massive attack on the cathedral, which is then admirably defended by Quasimodo and his molten lead. It’s exciting, it’s tense, it’s right out of a blockbuster movie.</p>
<p>And then—<em>psssssssst</em>—Hugo cuts to the entirely low-key financial discussion and hypochondriacal worryings of the king, who to top things off has been an almost nonexistent player in the story up to this point. Even worse, this turns out to be one of the longest chapters in the book.</p>
<p><strong>Tension and excitement are always high commodities in a story, but <em>especially</em> in your story&#8217;s climax</strong>. This is show-me-the-money time. If you can’t deliver solid tension here, then you gotta wonder where it is working. Once you cruise into the do-or-die mayhem of your climax, don’t cut away from it for <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>If you’ve got unfinished business, you’ve got three choices:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Wait until the resolution to take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Tie off the loose ends before the climax starts.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Rework this unfinished business so that it’s actually exciting enough to belong in the climax without demolishing your story’s tension or your readers’ interest.</p>
<h3><strong>Tell me your opinion: How are you keeping the tension high in your story&#8217;s climax?</strong></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, I&#8217;m going to be a bad blog writer. I&#8217;m not going to make you think at all to find the answer to the title question: &#8220;What is the role of theme in a story&#8217;s climax?&#8221; I&#8217;m just going to tell you straight up: The role of theme in your story&#8217;s climax is <em>all-important</em>. The theme is what makes the whole thing work with any kind of realism or meaning.</p>
<p>No pressure, right?</p>
<p>Actually, there <em>is</em> a lot of pressure, because if you miss the opportunity to knock your theme out of the park in <a title="Creating Stunning Character Arcs, Pt. 14: The Climax" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/05/character-arcs-14.html" target="_blank">your story&#8217;s climax</a>, then not only are you settling for less than the best for your story, but you may also end up crippling it.</p>
<p>But not to worry. As important a role as theme plays in a story&#8217;s climax, it&#8217;s also a totally fun and rewarding one. Even better, if you can figure out how theme will factor in to your story&#8217;s climax, then you&#8217;ll also have a shortcut to figuring out everything else you need to know about your theme.</p>
<h2>The Most Important Job of Theme in Your Story&#8217;s Climax</h2>
<p>Just what does theme <em>do</em> in the climax?</p>
<p>We sometimes think of theme as window dressing. It just sits there, looks pretty, and dresses up our novels with a little bit of moral magnitude. It makes our simple but entertaining tale of two star-crossed lovers into something that&#8217;s more <em>important</em> than just another happily-ever-after.</p>
<p>But if theme&#8217;s going to do that, it <em>has</em> to be more than just icing on the cake. It has to be the flour and eggs.</p>
<p>Stories themselves are just an expression&#8211;a dramatization&#8211;of their themes. And if your theme is a question, then the climax is the answer. When the story-long conflict comes to a head in the climax, the result of that final confrontation must provide more than just the external evidence of who won&#8211;the protagonist or the antagonistic force. The result of that conflict must also prove your story&#8217;s theme.</p>
<p>Consider Stephen King&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SR2PZG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002SR2PZG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=N4J47C4VFREB23AH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption</a>. </em>Andy Dufresne&#8217;s climactic escape isn&#8217;t just about his physical escape from the prison. It&#8217;s the final proof of the thematic Truth that hope lets us live through horrible circumstances and emerge triumphant on the other side. If he fails in his escape, he will not only remain in prison for the rest of his life, but his thematic premise will be proven false and its opposing assertion (&#8220;Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane.&#8221;) will be proven true.</p>

<h2>How Your Story&#8217;s Climax Will Help You Find Your Theme</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042FZVOY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0042FZVOY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=NGFMPT3DMQQUF4K7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignright wp-image-7172 " src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/robert-mckee-story-200x300.jpg" alt="Story by Robert McKee" width="167" height="251" /></a>If you&#8217;re ever uncertain of your story&#8217;s theme (or, by extension, your character&#8217;s arc), you need look no farther than your story&#8217;s climax. In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042FZVOY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0042FZVOY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwkmweil-20&amp;linkId=NGFMPT3DMQQUF4K7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Story</em></a>, Robert McKee reminds us:</p>
<blockquote><p>For no matter your inspiration, ultimately the story embeds its <a title="Don’t Know Your Story’s Theme? Take a Look at Your Character’s Arc" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/11/storys-theme.html" target="_blank">Controlling Idea</a> [theme] within the final climax….</p></blockquote>
<p>What happens in your climax? What battle is your protagonist fighting? He&#8217;s almost certainly going to be in pursuit of <a title="Why Your Character’s Goal Needs to Be 1 of These 5 Things" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/10/characters-goal.html" target="_blank">some physical goal</a>. He needs to kill the bad guy, win back the girl, steal the Maltese Falcon. But beneath the surface of the physical treasure hunt, there will always be a deeper reason. Your <a title="Why Your Character’s Motive Matters" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2010/07/why-your-characters-motive-matters.html" target="_blank">character&#8217;s motivation</a> for gaining this thing <em>must</em> be central to your story&#8217;s theme.</p>
<p>If he fights this final battle for a reason unconnected to your theme, then your story will fall apart. It may still be a slam-bang finale. It may even still be a reasonably entertaining story. But it won&#8217;t be an intellectually and emotionally stimulating tour de force. Worse, it will be fundamentally sloppy and incoherent on <em>at least</em> a subconscious level.</p>
<h2>Create a Story That&#8217;s Built to Reinforce Your Climax&#8217;s Theme</h2>
<p>Creating a thematically sound climax involves much more than than the climax itself. In order to create a climax that resonantly answers your story&#8217;s thematic question, you first have to build an entire story that <em>asks</em> the right question. This involves not just setting up the question in your story&#8217;s opening act, via the <a title="Creating Stunning Character Arcs, Pt. 2: The Lie Your Character Believes" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/02/character-arcs-2.html" target="_blank">Lie Your Character Believes</a>. It also means creating a consistent, <em>story-long</em> battle between the Lie and the Truth. McKee again:</p>
<blockquote><p>The positive and negative assertions of the same idea contest back and forth through the [story], building in intensity, until at the Crisis they collide head-on in a last impasse. Out of this rises the Story Climax, in which one or the other idea succeeds.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s an easy rule of thumb: Ask yourself, &#8220;Is your story going to end with a positive assertion of your theme?&#8221; If it does, then, for all intents and purposes, your ending will be a happy one, no matter the physical circumstances in which your protagonist ends the story. If your story ends with this affirmation of your theme, then it needs to begin with a negative <em>assertion</em> of the theme. In other words, the story&#8217;s beginning must posit that the theme is false. For example, <em>Shawshank Redemption</em> opens with its main character in the most hopeless of all situations: imprisoned for life for a crime he didn&#8217;t commit with no chance for appeal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Shawkshank-Redemption-Tim-Robbins-Andy-Dufresne-first-day-in-prison.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7712 " src="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Shawkshank-Redemption-Tim-Robbins-Andy-Dufresne-first-day-in-prison.jpg" alt="Shawshank Redemption Tim Robbins Andy Dufresne first day in prison" width="431" height="292" /></a></p>
<p>This negative assertion will then be countered by a positive assertion, then by a negative one, then by a positive one&#8211;and so on throughout the story until the final confrontation in the story&#8217;s climax when the thematic premise is finally proven once and for all.</p>
<p>(Of course this works in reverse for a story that will end by disproving the story&#8217;s Truth: it will begin with a <em>positive </em>assertion of the theme.)</p>
<p>Consider your story&#8217;s climax. How will it end? Happily or unhappily? How will your character have arced? Will he have <a title="Creating Stunning Character Arcs, Pt. 1: Can You Structure Characters?" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/02/character-arcs-1.html" target="_blank">overcome his Lie and discovered the Truth</a>? Will he have <a title="How to Write a Flat Character Arc, Pt. 1: The First Act" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/06/flat-character-arc-1.html" target="_blank">helped others to find a Truth he already knows</a>? Or will he have <a title="How to Write a Negative Character Arc, Pt. 1: The First Act" href="http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2014/07/negative-character-arc-1.html" target="_blank">fallen away from the Truth and into the Lie</a>?</p>
<p>Within the answers to these questions, you&#8217;ll find your story&#8217;s theme. Funnel your story&#8217;s main conflict into a final confrontation that will drive and by driven by the principle at the heart of your theme. Do that, and you will have strengthened every other aspect of your story.</p>
