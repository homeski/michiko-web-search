They do. And most of the Sharks seem like reasonable people. (With Kevin O&#8217;Leary doing his duty as designated villain, obligatory on most reality shows.) </p><p>But the core premise of Shark Tank &#8212; I hate it. I think it&#8217;s wrong, and I think it&#8217;s dangerous, and I think it hurts business owners.</p><p>Here&#8217;s why.</p><p><span id="more-44722"></span>The fundamental premise of Shark Tank is that people who have had big wins in business will automatically know more about <em>your</em> business than you do.</p><p>And underneath that is the part I <em>really</em> hate &#8212; the idea that some of us just have that &#8220;entrepreneurial gene,&#8221; and some don&#8217;t.</p><p>The Sharks have had some significant wins, so they&#8217;re &#8220;smart.&#8221; And as a small business owner? You&#8217;re just some fool who&#8217;s <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/naive/" target="_blank">naive</a> enough to think you can make a go of it on your own.</p><p>And so contestants audition for the right to go begging, hat in hand, to a handful of appointed gurus who might deign to take a large chunk of their business in exchange for a small amount of money. If they&#8217;re very very lucky.</p><p>Feh.</p><h3>Owning a business is something normal people do</h3><p>You don&#8217;t have to have some kind of special gene or supernatural ability to start and run a successful business. </p><p>You don&#8217;t need to be part of some anointed class. You don&#8217;t need rare connections or even some kind of super secret knowledge.</p><p>(And of course, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/david-siteman-garland-interview/" target="_blank">those of us who do business online have some nice advantages</a> in terms of costs, complexity, and scalability &#8212; which makes running a successful business even more doable.)</p><p>The traits you need to be a successful business owner aren&#8217;t the kind you read about in glossy business magazines, or their blogs. </p><p>The biggest trait you need is plenty of is stubbornness, but that can be boosted with the right support and encouragement. And it&#8217;s best when it&#8217;s paired with a solid ability to look realistically at the situation in front of you, and figure out the wisest next steps. (The right support can be useful there as well.)</p><p>I have known incredibly successful entrepreneurs who can barely tie their shoes. (No, not <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/goonies/" target="_blank">the crew I work with now</a>, this group are all pretty awesome.) <img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p><p>But they knew their business. And they knew what it took to be successful. On balance, moments of entrepreneurial delusion notwithstanding, <em>they understood their audience of customers</em> and what that audience needed.</p><p>Once you have that, everything else is just a matter of hanging in there and figuring stuff out.  </p><h3>The delusion filter</h3><p>As always on &#8220;reality&#8221; television, a big part of the entertainment value comes from feeling superior to the deluded contestants. </p><p><em>Entrepreneurial</em> is, after all, something of a synonym for “unemployable.”</p><p>But you don&#8217;t need a Shark Tank to find your blind spots. </p><p>The litmus test between delusion and confidence is your audience. If they’re following, sharing, and connecting with your content, you’re on to something. If they&#8217;re paying attention to you <em>and</em> they actually buy something, that&#8217;s your green light. Move forward with confidence.</p><p>For example, on the show Kevin rolled his eyes at brother and sister founders of Pipcorn for selling their specialty popcorn at $5 a bag, when regular old popcorn is maybe $1.50 a bag. </p><p>Apparently he’s never been inside a Whole Foods. Where Pipcorn was, in fact, already selling plenty of bags of their fancy popcorn. You know, on that aisle in Whole Foods where all the $5 popcorn is.</p><p>The most brilliant investor isn&#8217;t as smart as your audience about what&#8217;s going to make <em>your</em> business work.</p><h3>Protect your confidence</h3><p>I heard a piece of advice last year that blew me away. It comes from business coach Dan Sullivan, and it&#8217;s this: The first duty of every entrepreneur is to <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/protect-your-confidence/" target="_blank">protect your confidence</a>.</p><p>That, I believe, is where that &#8220;mindful stubbornness&#8221; comes from. </p><p>When you&#8217;re in negotiations with someone you shouldn&#8217;t be working with, that person may &#8220;neg&#8221; you &#8212; put you and your company down in order to make themselves seem like someone you need. It&#8217;s a technique used by the creepy &#8220;Pick Up Artist&#8221; community, and it&#8217;s also used by unethical marketers. (&#8220;Buy my product and maybe your friends won&#8217;t hate you so much!&#8221;)</p><p>Investors are not necessarily smarter than you are <em>about your audience and customers</em>. And thinking that they are can destroy a great little business. I&#8217;ve seen it happen first-hand more than once, and it makes me angry when it does.</p><p>Protect your confidence. And if a potential partner &#8220;negs&#8221; you, it&#8217;s an unmistakeable sign that you need to go the other direction. The negativity will corrode your business faster than any cash infusion can build it. Don&#8217;t look back. </p><h3>Partners are amazing &#8212; when they&#8217;re really partners</h3><blockquote><p>Some of them want to use you.<br>Some of them want to be used by you.<br>Some of them want to abuse you.<br>Some of them want to be abused.</p></blockquote><p>In the immortal words of Annie Lennox, everybody&#8217;s looking for something.</p><p>In the Shark Tank universe, the contestant &#8220;wins&#8221; if they get a deal, and &#8220;loses&#8221; if they don&#8217;t.</p><p>But &#8220;failed&#8221; contestant Julie Busha of Slawsa saw through this, and wrote about it on her blog:</p><blockquote><p>They like to invest in businesses where they can give added value (Daymond wants to plug something into his overseas manufacturing pipeline, Lori wants to get an item on QVC, Mark &#038; Robert want tech…and of course, Kevin wants a royalty). ~ <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.slawsa.com/pages/slawsa-on-shark-tank" target="_blank">Slawsa on Shark Tank</a> </p></blockquote><p>By Busha&#8217;s own analysis, if she&#8217;d made a deal, she would have &#8220;won&#8221; the game &#8212; but at a grave cost. She would have given away part of her business to a partner who didn&#8217;t really have anything to add. </p><p>(This is the part where I tip my hat to the integrity of the Sharks for not making a deal where they didn&#8217;t add value &#8212; even though they thought the product was excellent and were complimentary of Busha&#8217;s business skills.)</p><p>If you don’t have what your partner wants, there’s no deal to be made. Don’t obsess. Move on and find a better fit. </p><p>Try not to squander your energy or confidence thinking about a business partner, promotion partner, or customer who “just isn’t that into you.” </p><h3>The way that Shark Tank is amazing for their contestants</h3><p>I said above that Julie Busha didn&#8217;t &#8220;win&#8221; the show, but of course she did.</p><p>She was asking for $150,000, which she didn&#8217;t get. She did, however, get eight minutes on prime-time television on a popular show &#8212; and in the form of content, not advertising, so viewers were actually paying close attention.</p><p>She gave up no equity in her business, but received millions of dollars&#8217; worth of advertising. Or more to the point, <em>content</em>, which, as we know, works <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com/audio/media-not-marketing/" target="_blank">a whole lot better than advertising</a>. </p><p>So as an advertising and promotion vehicle for small business, I guess I don&#8217;t hate Shark Tank after all. In fact, I see an awful lot of the &#8220;failed&#8221; company products on the shelves of my local stores. And I notice them, because they had an eight-minute pitch to show me exactly why they were cool.</p><p>But I still don&#8217;t want you listening to anything Kevin O&#8217;Leary has to say. That guy doesn&#8217;t know beans about your business.</p><p><em>What do you think? <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.linkedin.com/groups/So-what-do-YOU-think-8117878.S.5948462521613635588" target="_blank"><strong>Join the discussion here in our LinkedIn discussion group</a>.</strong> </em></p><div class="author-box"><div><img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7cee49037749ad1b40cfd13ecbf44bda?s=100&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D100&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-100 photo' height='100' width='100' /> <span class="subheading">About the author</span><h3>Sonia Simone</h3><br><p><strong>Sonia Simone</strong> is co-founder and Chief Content Officer of Copyblogger Media.

Compose short subject lines</h3><p>The amount of space mobile devices provide for displaying subject lines can make even the most succinct writer cry herself to sleep. </p><p>Even though some email clients will display your entire subject line text, many do not.</p><p>And since your subject line in an email is akin to <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/magnetic-headlines/" target="_blank">your headline</a>, you don&#8217;t want to cut it off and miss an opportunity to connect with your reader.</p><p>The solution is to either keep your subject line short &#8212; 40 characters or less is a good rule of thumb &#8212; or position the most important phrase of your subject line in the first 40 characters to maximize your chances of readers seeing it.</p><h3>2. Use a single-column template</h3><p>On a mobile-device screen, multiple columns typically appear condensed and confusing to navigate.</p><p>A single column makes your email cross-device compatible and straightforward even when it&#8217;s viewed with different email clients.</p><p>Single columns can also simplify your design and spotlight your important content. </p><h3>3. Keep your email under 600 pixels wide</h3><p>While most modern mobile devices can handle responsive designs, there are exceptions.</p><p>When your email width is 600 pixels or less, users won&#8217;t have problems viewing emails that were formatted for large computer screens.</p><p>Set a width attribute in your email template&#8217;s table tag to 600 pixels or use the CSS width property to make this adjustment.</p><h3>4. Use a large font size</h3><p>Since a 10-pixel font is difficult to read on a desktop computer screen, and small screens make small fonts even smaller, most people will delete your email before they&#8217;ll squint and strain their eyes in order to read your tiny text.</p><p>A font size of 13 or 14 pixels makes your email substantially more readable on a small screen. </p><p>But don&#8217;t be afraid to go even larger than that. Large fonts make your emails easier to read on both desktops and mobile devices.</p><h3>5. Display small images</h3><p>Smaller images reduce load times and bandwidth. Many mobile users still use 3G or slower, connections, so the speed at which images load is vital.</p><p>If you have technical chops, or know someone who can help you, use responsive-coding techniques to load smaller images on mobile devices and larger ones on other devices.</p><p>Another option is to shrink an image by 50 percent and compress it at a slightly higher compression rate than normal to both load your images faster and conserve your user&#8217;s bandwidth.</p><h3>6. Provide a distinct call to action</h3><p>A <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/copywriting-101/" target="_blank">call to action</a> should prompt your email recipient to do something. Generally, that &#8220;something&#8221; is tapping (or clicking) a button that further leads him down the path you want him to take. </p><p>Your call to action needs to be large enough for him to easily and effectively do this on a mobile-device screen.</p><p>Fingers are not nearly as exact as mouse pointers, and while mobile manufacturers have created devices that accurately respond to your actions, they&#8217;re not perfect.</p><p>If your reader has to tap more than once to continue interacting with your content, then there&#8217;s a chance he won&#8217;t bother. </p><p>Display a compelling call to action that is at least a 40 pixels square &#8212; and preferably larger than that &#8212; to keep the reader engaged with your email.</p><h3>7. Don&#8217;t make your call to action an image</h3><p>Some email clients only display images from verified sending addresses. So if you use an image for your call to action and your recipient&#8217;s email client doesn&#8217;t have images enabled for your sending address, she will not see it.</p><p>After all the work you put into crafting your emails, it&#8217;s a bummer to miss an opportunity to get your reader to take action.</p><p>But the trouble is that when recipients do view <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/powerful-images/" target="_blank">images</a>, they often improve click-through rates.</p><p>If you decide to use an image for your call to action, make sure the image has a descriptive ALT tag that matches the text that appears in the image, such as &#8220;click here.&#8221;</p><p>That way, even if the image isn&#8217;t shown, the message in your ALT text will still appear.</p><h3>8. Avoid menu bars</h3><p>As I mentioned above, since fingers are not precision instruments, tiny menu and navigation bars are frustrating to use.</p><p>I recommend avoiding them completely. It&#8217;s an email, not <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/design-that-connects/" target="_blank">a website</a>, so you don&#8217;t need a traditional menu or navigation bar. </p><p>With emails, stick to the basic building blocks of the web: links and images.</p><h3>9. Don&#8217;t stack links</h3><p>Stacked links cause the same problems as other tiny forms of navigation. Here&#8217;s an example of stacked links:</p><p><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> <br><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.yahoo.com" target="_blank">Yahoo</a> <br><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.bing.com" target="_blank">Bing</a></p><p>If you imagine stacked links within a paragraph, you can see how easy it would be to accidentally click the wrong link.</p><p>Also, when two words are right on top of each other, you may mistakenly link the two words to the same destination rather than assigning a distinct link to each word.</p><p>Including multiple links in an email is fine, but be sure to look at a preview of the email and separate links with other text, images, or whitespace as needed.</p><h3>10. Test on multiple devices</h3><p>Don&#8217;t worry; you don&#8217;t need to buy a dozen mobile phones to properly test your emails. </p><p><a href=https://litmus.com/email-testing target="_blank">Litmus</a> has a paid service that runs comprehensive tests on more than 30 email clients. They offer a free seven-day trial to get you started.</p><p>To run a test, you simply provide your email message&#8217;s HTML. Litmus then opens your email message in multiple clients, snaps screenshots of each, and sends you an email with the results. The test usually takes just a few minutes.</p><p>A quick scan through the results will alert you to any visual problems that may occur on different devices.   </p><h3>The reader&#8217;s experience is your first priority</h3><p>Think about your own experience when you encounter an email that doesn&#8217;t display properly on your mobile device.</p><p>Even if it&#8217;s from a source that interests you, you may not want to spend extra time deciphering the message.</p><p>And if you can&#8217;t see the action the sender wants you to take, you certainly won&#8217;t take it.</p><p>Instead of putting your reader in this undesirable scenario, you can easily create mobile-friendly emails that display properly on any device.</p><p>What special steps do you take to produce an optimal mobile-viewing experience for your email readers? </p><p>Let us know over on <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Your-Emails-Must-Be-MobileFriendly-8117878.S.5948083617904279555" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> &#8230;</p><p><em><strong>Editor&#8217;s note:</strong> If you found this post useful, we suggest you also read <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/37-email-marketing-tips/" target="_blank">37 Tips for Writing Emails That Get Opened, Read, and Clicked</a> by Henneke Duistermaat.</em></p><p><em><small>Flickr Creative Commons Image via <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.flickr.com/photos/misbehave/2352753067/in/faves-10914232@N06/" target="_blank">Karen</a>.</small></em></p><p class="alert"><em><strong>About the Author:</strong> <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.softwarebyrob.com/" target="_blank">Rob Walling</a> is the founder of the lightweight email and marketing automation software <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.getdrip.com/" target="_blank">Drip</a>.

So he created a course on the topic, and the rest (including his podcast!) is history.</p><p><span id="more-46003"></span><strong>In this 35-minute episode David Siteman Garland and I discuss:</strong></p><ul><li>His non-entrepreneurial path to online business</li><li>How he decided to build The Rise to The Top</li><li>The continuing rise of the mediapreneur</li><li>Why you don&#8217;t need to produce new content forever</li><li>Why he quit his incredibly popular podcast</li><li>The power of the podcast interview format</li><li>The infinite scalability of online courses</li><li>His very best advice on creating an awesome interview</li><li>How to start developing your own online courses</li></ul><p><center><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com/audio/david-siteman-garland-interview/" target="_blank" class="btn-primary-medium">Click Here to Listen to Rainmaker FM Episode No. 20</a></p><p>Or, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/new-rainmaker/id804430578" target="_blank">grab it in iTunes</a>.</center></p><p><em><small><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://unsplash.com/timmossholder" target="_blank">Image by Tim Mossholder</a></em><small></p><div class="author-box"><div><img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/34534405aa368793a1a65168bf3b808f?s=100&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D100&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-100 photo' height='100' width='100' /> <span class="subheading">About the author</span><h3>Brian Clark</h3><br><p>Brian Clark is founder and CEO of Copyblogger, host of <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~rainmaker.fm/">Rainmaker.FM</a>, and evangelist for the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~rainmakerplatform.com/">Rainmaker Platform</a>.

It’s pretty powerful in what it can do, and more importantly, what it can take off your plate so you can concentrate on content.</p><p>By the end of March 2015, however, there will be a more advanced plan available called Rainmaker Professional. As you might expect, it will have powerful additional features that will carry a higher price tag.</p><p>Here’s what’s coming in Rainmaker Professional:</p><h4>Advanced Reporting and Analytics</h4><p>The way you see your business growing and changing each day will become even more useful in the near future. The Rainmaker Platform&#8217;s analytics and reporting functions will evolve with more advanced reporting options for those who want them.</p><p>You&#8217;ll be able to drill down into the stats that you really want to see, and slice and dice your preferences from within the dashboard itself. That means creating simple, at-a-glance views of the specific metrics you want (such as demographics, or specific segments of your customers and prospects).</p><p>This is exciting stuff, because you&#8217;d normally need a third-party tool to accomplish what we&#8217;re planning for analytics. For those who sign up this week, however, it comes standard with Rainmaker.</p><p>And yes, podcasting stats are on the way. Soon, you&#8217;ll be able to see how your podcast is performing, without the hassle of separate hosting and stats packages. We&#8217;ve got a few more ideas on the near horizon for Rainmaker Podcasting that we&#8217;re not quite ready to talk about (but you&#8217;ll get upgraded to). Just remember, <em>we&#8217;re podcasters too</em>, so you can bet we&#8217;re motivated to make this the best and easiest podcasting solution on the planet for entrepreneurs.</p><h4>More Designs and Landing Page Templates</h4><p>You may have noticed that there&#8217;s been a slight change in how we&#8217;re developing design themes lately. We call it the &#8220;Rainmaker First&#8221; philosophy.</p><p>Brian Gardner, Rafal Tomal, and Lauren Mancke are always hard at work designing and developing new themes and landing page templates, but now our (and their) focus has shifted to supplying our Rainmaker Platform customers with the best one-click web design in the world.</p><p>As of this week there are 29 design themes and 15 landing page templates (not including the custom landing page builder) available to Rainmaker customers, and there are many more on the way.</p><p>And no, this does not mean we are neglecting our beloved StudioPress customers. In fact, this philosophy will end up benefitting everyone in the end. As these Rainmaker designs are tested and used in real-world online business situations, they&#8217;ll only get better.</p><h4>Social Media Posting and Scheduling</h4><p>This is a big one, and a no-brainer. Very soon, Rainmaker customers will be able to &#8212; from within the Rainmaker dashboard &#8212; post and schedule updates, links, photos, and other content to their social networks.</p><p>Your Rainmaker site is the home base of your business, and the importance of using social networks to attract an audience and send them back <em>to</em> your home base is undeniable. We think social media posting and scheduling tools have become a necessity for the savvy online publisher, but they should be integrated into your website platform with your daily workflow.</p><h4>Integrated RSS Reader</h4><p>So, the ability to post and schedule social media updates from your Rainmaker dashboard will be cool, but how do you find intriguing content from other sources to share with your audience? And how do you manage the very real potential for information overload?</p><p>That tool used to be Google Reader (RIP), but now, for our customers, it will be the Rainmaker Reader. This coming integrated RSS reader will be the place you&#8217;ll be able to strategically track your industry feeds, find great content to share, and glean inspiration for producing your own content.</p><h4>Curation-to-Content Tools</h4><p>Want to easily manage and publish a curated topical newsletter? Want that link from your RSS reader dropped into an existing post? How about effortlessly sending it out to your social media accounts?</p><p>The Rainmaker Curator will &#8212; with the click of a button &#8212; allow you to easily port the great content you find via RSS directly into a new or existing article you&#8217;re writing for your own audience. This will become an invaluable tool in your broader editorial role as a content marketer.</p><h4>Serious Learning Management System</h4><p>The first product ever launched off of Copyblogger, <em>Teaching Sells</em>, shows people step-by-step how to create sophisticated online training courses, along with the business models that power them. And since 2007, people have begged us to give them the turn-key platform that allowed for content creation, membership management, marketing, and all the other technological tasks that go with running a legitimate online business.</p><p>We&#8217;ve built that platform with Rainmaker. But we&#8217;re creating course creation tools that constitute a true learning management system &#8212; one that will help you with the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, and delivery of e-learning courses and training programs.</p><p>What does that mean? Effortlessly create an online course without a developer, optimize your course content based on student behavior and feedback, run quizzes and surveys, and drip out your content (either paid or free) exactly as you want to, plus much more.</p><h4>Marketing Automation/Adaptive Content</h4><p>This is one of the most important technology applications that you&#8217;ll ever put in place for online marketing. And finally, it won&#8217;t cost you a ridiculous amount of money as with the current solutions.</p><p>Marketing automation (more appropriately known as <em>adaptive content</em> for those without sales teams) is not just about saving yourself from repeated tasks, or the drudgery of unscalable growth. Beyond those obvious benefits, its primary functions are:</p><ol><li>To vastly improve the experience of your prospects and customers</li><li>To intelligently, and eventually effortlessly, grow revenue and profit</li><li>To make more of the traffic you already have without chasing more</li></ol><p>Rainmaker&#8217;s automation and adaptive content features will allow you to tag, add, delete, and manage customers or prospects from your various email lists, build specific interest lists based on real-world actions on your site, nurture leads in a way that&#8217;s sensitive to their inbox, allow you to create different content experiences for different people, and much more.</p><p>You can use MailChimp, Infusionsoft, AWeber, or the other popular email services we&#8217;re in the process of adding. Or you can choose the integrated add-on Rainmaker email service we&#8217;re working on right now. Either way, Rainmaker Professional will go to work for you in previously unimagined ways.</p><h3>Pay once instead of forever</h3><p>Now, let me make this clear — <strong>there will be a charge</strong> for existing Standard customers to upgrade to Professional. It’s just that it won’t be an increase in the quarterly or annual recurring fee. It’ll be a one-time charge that locks you in to the Professional plan for the life of your account at the Standard pricing.</p><p>In short, you get to upgrade to the more powerful version of the platform that you’ll need as your site and business grow, but you’ll save a huge amount over time compared to those who sign up once the Professional plan is released to the general public. This is an option that will only be available to existing Rainmaker customers who get on board before the Professional Plan is released.</p><p><strong><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~rainmakerplatform.com" target="_blank">Take a look at what Rainmaker can do</a>, then take it on a free test drive today.</strong></p><div class="author-box"><div><img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/34534405aa368793a1a65168bf3b808f?s=100&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D100&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-100 photo' height='100' width='100' /> <span class="subheading">About the author</span><h3>Brian Clark</h3><br><p>Brian Clark is founder and CEO of Copyblogger, host of <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~rainmaker.fm/">Rainmaker.FM</a>, and evangelist for the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~rainmakerplatform.com/">Rainmaker Platform</a>.

Complex bunch.</p><p>They pull out their wallets and purses to trade hard-earned dollars for stuff. Stuff we design, organize, grow, program, or manufacture.</p><p>Stuff like curved TVs. Endurance events. Spicy vodka. Graphic design textbooks. Massive multiplayer online games. Lilac bulbs. Tax preparation software. Workout regimens.</p><p>If customers buy the stuff you make, then you got two things right:</p><ol><li><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/content-marketing/" target="_blank">You built a healthy audience.</a></li><li>You built products they love, which, of course, explains their buying behavior &#8212; if they have the money and they want it, they&#8217;ll buy it.</li></ol><p>It&#8217;s not magic. There&#8217;s a blueprint. <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com/training/" target="_blank">A faithful roadmap</a>.</p><p>But that&#8217;s not all of it.<span id="more-44721"></span></p><p>Between those two poles (building the audience and building the product), there is an element we can&#8217;t ignore: <em>the customer experience</em>. Which, no matter how hard you argue to the contrary, is probably terrible.</p><p>Don&#8217;t kid yourself. Even if it is good, it can be better. And when the customer experience is better, your customers are happier. And when customers are happier, you make more money. </p><p>Which is exactly what a <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~bain.com/bainweb/pdfs/cms/hotTopics/closingdeliverygap.pdf" target="_blank">Bain &#038; Company study reported</a>.</p><h3>Why the customer experience usually stinks</h3><p>See, the story businesses tell themselves &#8212; a whopping 80 percent, in fact &#8212; is that they deliver a &#8220;superior experience.&#8221; Not just a good experience. But a <em>superior</em> one. </p><p>This story is fiction, however. Because when asked, only eight percent of customers believe these companies were actually delivering.</p><p>That&#8217;s a huge discrepancy. So, why this customer experience gap?</p><p>Two reasons:</p><ol><li><strong>Growth initiatives damage your loyal customer base.</strong> Initiatives like fee increases, feature changes, and license limitations. These changes piss off your best people.</li><li><strong>Good relationships are hard to build.</strong> Need I say more?</li></ol><p>As the authors of the Bain &#038; Company report wrote: </p><blockquote><p>It&#8217;s extremely difficult to understand what customers really want, keep the promises you make to them, and maintain the right dialogue to ensure that you adjust your propositions according to customers&#8217; changing or increasing needs.</p></blockquote><p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/purpose-of-a-business.png" alt="purpose-of-a-business" width="650" height="613" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45850" /></p><p>As the authors go on to write, even efforts to understand customers can backfire.</p><p>We pillage the data in our web analytics, harvest the results from surveys, and identify patterns in purchasing behaviors. </p><p>Good things to know, but ultimately &#8220;buyers become numbers rather than people, segments rather than individuals. Companies become deaf to the real voices of real customers.&#8221;</p><p>Thus, the quality of customer experience declines, which doesn&#8217;t surprise Bryan and Jeffrey Eisenberg.</p><h3>How big data misleads marketers and execs</h3><p>In their book <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.buyerlegends.com/" target="_blank"><em>Buyer Legends</em></a>, the authors write, &#8220;This is the problem with all context-poor communication.&#8221; Without context, &#8220;statistics, test results, and best practices can often, and often have, misled many a marketer and executive.&#8221;</p><p>To successfully read data, the authors explain, you need to understand the physical, emotional, and psychological environments where that data is mined. </p><p>It&#8217;s a little bit like being an archaeologist, except your specimens are alive, not a scattered collection of ancient bones.</p><p>However, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.kaushik.net/avinash/difference-web-reporting-web-analysis/" target="_blank">Avinash Kaushik points out</a> what typically happens: &#8220;The thankless job of web reporting is to punt the part of interpreting the data, understanding the context, and identifying actions to the recipient of the data puke.&#8221; </p><p>Question is: Does that recipient understand the context? Probably not.</p><p>Furthermore, analysts think the consumer of the future is likely to resist &#8220;tidy consumer segments&#8221; &#8212; a cardinal marketing concept.</p><p>These analysts point to research that demonstrates low-income buyers reach for luxury items while high-end customers seek cheap items to satisfy basic needs.</p><p>This creates a &#8220;consumer in the middle.&#8221;</p><p>In their <em>Global Agenda</em> article &#8220;<a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.bain.com/bainweb/PDFs/cms/Marketing/Consumer_2020_Global_Agenda.pdf" target="_blank">The Consumer of 2020</a>,&#8221; market analysts James Allen and Darrell Rigby write, &#8220;understanding customers in the middle &#8212; and how they make purchasing decisions, depending on category, time of day, and even mood &#8212; will continue to be key to developing products and services.&#8221;</p><p>Pay attention to that line between the em dashes: &#8220;and how they make purchasing decisions, depending on category, time of day, and even mood.&#8221; They are talking about the customer experience.</p><p>So it&#8217;s not just about having the data, since Big Data is only half the equation &#8230;</p><p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/big-data.png" alt="big-data" width="650" height="488" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45851" /></p><p>The other half is Big Story.</p><h3>How to make Big Data play nice with Big Story</h3><p>&#8220;The ultimate challenge for data scientists,&#8221; says Laura Patterson in her article <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.marketingprofs.com/articles/2014/26436/why-your-data-scientists-need-to-be-storytellers-and-how-to-get-them-there" target="_blank">Why Your Data Scientists Need to Be Better Storytellers</a>, &#8220;is to use the data to create stories. Data scientists worth their salt can use spreadsheets and visualization tools to support analysis.&#8221;</p><p>She continues:  </p><blockquote><p>Their real value lies in their ability to transform the data into a narrative experience for both internal and external communication.</p></blockquote><p>Tough sledding, unless you have the right tools.</p><p>Tools like <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/empathy-maps/" target="_blank">empathy maps</a>, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/asset-pillar-infographic/" target="_blank">asset pillars</a>, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/master-storytelling/" target="_blank">storyboards</a>, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/content-gaps/" target="_blank">personas</a>, and <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/worldview-content-marketing/" target="_blank">worldview interviews</a>. </p><p>But even with these tools, the insights can lead to fragmented, isolated stories. Your message, forgive the pun, is all over the map.</p><p>What you need is a way to merge all this data and these stories into one Big Story. But before we get into that, what exactly do I mean by Big Story?</p><p>Well, at this point, all I mean is the complete story of the customer journey with your product or service. From start to finish. It&#8217;s how a customer finds, interacts, and ends the relationship with you and your product.</p><p>That&#8217;s the Big Story. The only story, really, that matters. And it involves everyone in your company. Not just the developers, analysts, and marketers.</p><p>And to date, the best way to understand this journey is through the experience map.</p><h3>The benefits of an experience map</h3><p>&#8220;[The experience map] is the sum-totality of how customers engage with your company and brand,&#8221; says <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://hbr.org/2010/10/understanding-customer-experie/" target="_blank">Adam Richardson</a>, &#8220;not just in a snapshot in time, but throughout the entire arc of being a customer.&#8221;</p><p>And according to UX designer, Luke Chambers, it&#8217;s an idea that was <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~uxmastery.com/ux-marks-the-spot-mapping-the-user-experience/" target="_blank">borne out of the user experience</a>. He unpacks some key benefits of the experience map:</p><ul><li>Create consistency in your messages</li><li>Discover and capitalize on critical &#8220;moments of truth&#8221; for the user</li><li>Unite isolated departments across your company</li><li>Ignite a corporate focus on the customer</li></ul><p>As the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~mappingexperiences.com/" target="_blank">folks over at Adaptive Path point out</a> in their helpful <em>Guide to Experience Mapping</em>:</p><blockquote><p>When done well, an experience map illuminates the holistic customer experience, demonstrating the highs and lows people feel while interacting with your product or service. The process of mapping uncovers the key customer moments that, once improved, will unlock a more compelling and more valuable overall experience.</p></blockquote><h3>What does an experience map look like?</h3><p>An experience map is a large visual of the path a consumer takes &#8212; from beginning to end &#8212; with your product. </p><p>The goal of this map is to get everyone on your team on the same page about the customer journey &#8212; so it is to be shared. In addition, the map must be an easy-to-understand, self-contained unit.</p><p>Here&#8217;s an example from <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/the-anatomy-of-an-experience-map/" target="_blank">Adaptive Path</a> for Rail Europe:</p><p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/rail-europe-experience-map.png" alt="rail-europe-experience-map" width="650" height="488" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45852" /></p><p>This map demonstrates the journey a consumer would take while riding the trains in Europe. It follows her from the early stages of research and planning to the end of her trip.</p><p>You see what she is doing (searching Google, looking up timetables), what she is thinking during each action (Do I have everything I need? Am I on the right train?), and what she is feeling (Stressed: I&#8217;m about to leave the country and Rail Europe won&#8217;t answer the phone).</p><p>It&#8217;s framed in guiding principles (the red band at the top) and terminates with opportunities for Rail Europe (engage people on social media, improve the paper ticket experience).</p><p>In a piece on the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/the-anatomy-of-an-experience-map/" target="_blank">Anatomy of an Experience Map</a>, Chris Risdon at Adaptive Path suggests your experience map should have these five components:</p><ol><li><strong>The lens</strong>: This is how a particular person (a persona) views the journey. Keep in mind, this journey will not be the same for everyone. You will more than likely have more than one experience map.</li><li><strong>The journey model</strong>: This is the actual design of the map. If all goes well, it should render insight to answer questions like &#8220;What happens here? What&#8217;s important about this transition?&#8221;</li><li><strong>Qualitative insight</strong>: This is where the Doing-Thinking-Feeling of an empathy map comes in handy.</li><li><strong>Quantitative information</strong>: This is data that brings attention to certain aspects of your map. It reveals information like &#8220;80 percent of people abandon the process at this touchpoint.&#8221;</li><li><strong>Takeaways</strong>: This is where the map earns its money. What are the conclusions? Opportunities? Threats to the system? Does it identify your strengths? Highlight your weaknesses?</li></ol><p>And now that we have a handle on this artifact, let&#8217;s see it in action.</p><h3>How to create an experience map</h3><p>For starters, get the right people in the room.</p><p>Invite a representative from every department in your company. If they touch the customer &#8212; in any way &#8212; invite them.</p><p>At a minimum, invite a person from sales, marketing, customer support, legal, human resources, finance, IT, research and development, production, fulfillment, and any stakeholder.</p><p>The Meeting Coordinator (MC) should send an invite for the meeting and explain that each person should come armed with a customer dossier. The MC can encourage the invitees to find this data in sources such as:</p><ul><li>Call center logs</li><li>Web analytics reports</li><li>File logs</li><li>Customer satisfaction surveys</li><li>Personas</li><li>Interviews</li><li>One-on-one interviews</li><li>Comments on your blog</li><li>Amazon reviews</li><li>Real-life conversations</li><li>Support emails</li><li>Testimonials</li><li>The social web</li><li>Forums</li><li>Customer conversations</li></ul><p>At the start of the meeting, the MC should make sure the meeting has these essentials:</p><ul><li>Large whiteboard or chalkboard</li><li>Hundreds of Post-it notes</li><li>Enough markers for everyone (a mix of color works nicely)</li><li>A room large enough to fit everyone comfortably</li><li>Snacks and drinks (especially caffeinated liquids)</li></ul><p>The MC should also lay some ground rules:</p><ul><li>All suggestions are welcome &#8212; even if these are gut intuitions and not necessarily backed by documented facts.</li><li>All participants should feel free to approach the board to place Post-it notes, write, and draw to add to the map.</li><li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to use words to explain &#8212; a lot of words (I&#8217;ll explain below).</li></ul><p>Risdon&#8217;s group at Adaptive Path suggests breaking up the map in a framework of what the customer is Doing, Thinking, and Feeling throughout the journey (see the Rail Europe map above for an example). </p><p>Other categories you may want to consider are Place, Time, Devices, Channels, Touchpoints, and Relationships.</p><p>This meeting should be a four-to-eight-hour affair. You want to work in one long stretch &#8212; of course with plenty of breaks, snacks, and a good lunch &#8212; until you&#8217;ve exhausted all avenues.</p><p>The whiteboard may look like a big mess. That is okay.</p><h3>Designing your experience map</h3><p>If all went well during the meeting, the whiteboard should be a hot mess. But the MC, a designer, and a marketer (with writing chops) should sort through the mess and bring it to resemble something like this:</p><p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/sf-muni-user-journey.png" alt="sf-muni-user-journey" width="650" height="399" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45853" /></p><p>You can find that map and other examples <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/new-ways-of-visualizing-the-customer-journey-map/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>When you sit down to sort through the mess, keep in mind you don&#8217;t have to add all touchpoints that are mentioned. Select only the most important. The pivotal moments. </p><p>What you are after is a comprehensive and meaningful picture of the customer experience with your product &#8212; so only include meaningful touchpoints.</p><p>Once the MC, designer, and marketer have created a meaningful timeline, it&#8217;s time to design. And the principles of good design for experience maps include these:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> any viewer should be able to make sense out of the map at one glance. Don&#8217;t be afraid to include description boxes.</li><li><strong>Keep it self-contained:</strong> The experience map should stand on its own. Everything needed to understand the map should be included.</li><li><strong>Keep it sharable:</strong> Create a three-foot by six-foot poster to hang on the wall, but also create an 11-inch by 14-inch laminated version you can pass around.</li></ul><p>To quote Adaptive Path, &#8220;To tell a great story, you&#8217;ll need to focus, communicate hierarchy, sketch fearlessly, and try to keep it simple. When it all comes together, it&#8217;s time for the final payoff: using your experience map.&#8221;</p><p>Once the map has been shared, your next step is to analyze the map. Here are two tools to help you do just that.</p><h3>Creating the &#8220;prescriptive experience map&#8221;</h3><p>The first tool is called the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis" target="_blank">SWOT matrix</a>.</p><p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/swot-analysis.png" alt="swot-analysis" width="650" height="731" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45854" /></p><p>While a Strength-Weakness-Opportunity-Threat matrix is normally used to evaluate the future of a project or business, I&#8217;ve found the matrix useful in asking the right questions when evaluating customer interactions:</p><ul><li>How do you know there is a problem? Is this a minor or major threat? How will it impact the company?</li><li>How do you know this is an opportunity?</li><li>Is this a strength? Is there a way to amplify this strength?</li><li>Is this a weakness? Will it be meaningful and profitable if we improve it? This is where the SWOT comes in.</li></ul><p>The goal of this exercise is to help you find the actions, insights, and impact on the company that will lead to a prescriptive map.</p><p>It&#8217;s always healthy, however, to prioritize the actions, insights, and impact on the company (not all of your discoveries will be meaningful or profitable).</p><p>My favorite framework for determining priorities is the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Things_First_%28book%29" target="_blank">four-quadrant matrix</a>:</p><ol><li>Important and urgent</li><li>Important, but not urgent</li><li>Urgent, but not important</li><li>Neither important nor urgent</li></ol><p>Once you&#8217;ve got your actions, insights, and impact on the company filtered through that framework &#8212; and the urgent and important aspects are taken care of &#8212; next you need to sit down and create the prescriptive experience map.</p><p>This is the place of sublime customer experience. This is future-looking.</p><p>To get there, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://hbr.org/2010/10/understanding-customer-experie/" target="_blank">Adam Richardson</a> says, &#8220;Almost every conceivable customer question, problem, and need has been anticipated and addressed, creating a seamless experience that appears &#8212; to the customer &#8212; effortless.&#8221;</p><p>The prescriptive map is your ultimate goal. It&#8217;s a new map designed to guide your company in creating that customer experience that will make your mediocre experience a superior one &#8212; an experience customers will love. And you can test whether or not you reach that pinnacle of experiences through after-purchase surveys.</p><p>Richardson points out:</p><blockquote><p>This doesn&#8217;t happen by accident; it happens by design. As is often the case in life, making something look easy is very difficult.</p></blockquote><h3>A quick and dirty experience map in action</h3><p>Let me close with a personal example.</p><p>Take <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/lede/" target="_blank">The Lede</a>, one of Copyblogger Media&#8217;s podcasts. What would an experience map look like for it?</p><p>Well, as I mentioned above, there&#8217;s not one journey to rule them all, so in this case we&#8217;ll create an experience out of one of our personas (which is our lens).</p><p>It will be our &#8220;marketing professional at an agency&#8221; persona. One journey might look like this:</p><p style="padding-left:30px;">Imagine his boss emails him a link to follow Copyblogger on Twitter. &#8220;Treat their stream as a resource,&#8221; she says.</p><p style="padding-left:30px;">He visits their website, searches their blog, and then creates a column in TweetDeck for all of his favorite Copyblogger writers.</p><p style="padding-left:30px;">One of those writers shares a link to a podcast called The Lede. He clicks the link and listens to the episode online. He&#8217;s impressed, wants to listen to more, and decides to subscribe to the podcast.</p><p style="padding-left:30px;">However, he can&#8217;t. He has an Android, and The Lede is not on Stitcher.</p><p style="padding-left:30px;">The user has to listen to the podcast on the page. <em>Not his ideal experience.</em></p><p style="padding-left:30px;">He then leaves a comment on <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://plus.google.com/+Copyblogger/posts" target="_blank">Copyblogger&#8217;s Google+ page</a> stating he wishes The Lede was on Stitcher.</p><p><img src="http://www.copyblogger.com/images/2014/12/the-lede-map.png" alt="the-lede-map" width="650" height="488" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45855" /></p><p>This map then becomes a tool we analyze for underserved opportunities. </p><p>Through a real, live experience, we discovered that we have an audience that wants the podcast to be available on Stitcher.</p><p>So, it makes sense <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~copyblogger.com/stitcher" target="_blank">to put The Lede on it</a>. </p><h3>Adapting content for each customer &#8230;</h3><p>No doubt creating an experience map is a huge undertaking. It involves time and resources. And you want a healthy return for that investment. </p><p>That&#8217;s why the map itself is not as important as what you get out of the map. The analysis is what counts &#8212; getting to the prescriptive map.</p><p>Because the prescriptive map will help you create and adapt content and products to fit your customers&#8217; desires and tastes. Which will make them really happy. </p><p>In other words, delivering content and products at the right time, on the right device, to the right person. </p><p>That&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;ll be focusing on in 2015. Something called <em>adaptive content</em>.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p>And join us over on <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Could-This-Be-Secret-Making-8117878.S.5945910548502769664" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> to discuss how you evaluate your customers&#8217; experiences and how those experiences influence your content strategy.</p><p><em><small>Flickr Creative Commons Image via <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.flickr.com/photos/captain_die/13736098644/in/photostream/" target="_blank">Alexander Rentsch</a>.</small></em></p><div class="author-box"><div><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/81c83444aed195de41d9e227bf13c2dc?s=100&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D100&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-100 photo' height='100' width='100' /> <span class="subheading">About the author</span><h3>Demian Farnworth</h3><br><p>Demian Farnworth is Copyblogger Media's Chief Copywriter.

What about &#8230;</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> (Laughs)</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> (Laughing) &#8230; content marketing?</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Oh, content marketing! Okay. Content marketing. </p><p>Thinking back over 2014, I think of two major events that &#8212; I don&#8217;t want to say <em>defined</em> content marketing &#8212; but at least changed the course, gave it a rumble, so to speak.</p><p>The first event was when Google killed Authorship, and the other one was the emergence of native advertising.</p><h3>The impact of Google killing Authorship</h3><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Let&#8217;s start with Google killing Authorship, because obviously that was big news. </p><p>What about that really sticks out? And then, more importantly, what can we learn from that?</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Google Authorship was something that Google rolled out about three years ago in June.</p><p>It was an experiment, and &#8212; as we know with Google, nothing is a sacred cow &#8212; the experiment failed. </p><p>Google Authorship was supposed to allow authors to claim their content and then display it in search results with markup code. </p><p>Over the past three years, we&#8217;ve probably all seen when we&#8217;ve gone to Google and searched for something that some of those entries had photos on them. That&#8217;s the display or the image support that Google allowed. </p><p>Google was trying to connect authors with their content, because they had PageRank, and PageRank evaluates and judges content based upon the content on that page. </p><p>The other half of the equation is <em>who is the author</em>. They wanted to bring in an authority factor. So it was not just the content on the page that was important but also who wrote it. </p><p>Authorship was their attempt to do that, and it didn&#8217;t work out. Ultimately, they killed image support. They actually, in December of 2013, reduced image support and then ultimately killed it in June of 2014. </p><p>Then just this past August, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://plus.google.com/+JohnMueller/posts/HZf3KDP1Dm8" target="_blank">Google said Authorship&#8217;s done</a>, and it&#8217;s gone. </p><p>The reasons why they did it were, first, low adoption rates. People weren&#8217;t implementing it. It was somewhat complex. It was even absent in some verticals. </p><p>You go to some industries, and it&#8217;s completely absent. Nobody was implementing it. </p><p>And, in fact, it had such a low adoption rate only 30 percent of the top 50 most influential social media marketers had implemented Authorship. </p><p>Those who you&#8217;d think it would be most important to weren&#8217;t even getting involved, weren&#8217;t even interested in it. </p><p>The other reason it failed was that it just had low value to searchers. The novelty had worn off.</p><p>Google sees that half their searches come from mobile devices. And since photos and Authorship snippets didn&#8217;t look right in mobile searches, they decided to kill it.</p><h3>Predictions about Google+ and Author Rank</h3><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Let me jump in here and highlight a lesson, what we can take from this. </p><p>When Authorship came out, there was a pretty big rush of people, especially in our industry, who implemented it on their sites, and with good reason. </p><p>And it also seemed to really increase Google+ usage there for awhile. Once they removed Authorship, it feels like people have started to use Google+ less.</p><p>The lesson is, as always, with Google and any of these social media sites: You have to be careful about putting too many eggs in one basket because the rules of the game can change at any time, just as they did here. </p><p>It&#8217;s not that implementing Authorship was a waste of time by any means, but it&#8217;s just another lesson that these things can change. </p><p>It should just be one portion of your strategy, and you never want to go all in on anything that you don&#8217;t control.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> That&#8217;s right. And I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised &#8212; even though they&#8217;ve said contrary &#8212; if at some point in the future that Google kills Google+.</p><p>Because it&#8217;s a social site now as it stands, and that&#8217;s the only function that it&#8217;s really serving. Unless they find a fundamental use for it, it&#8217;s not serving a business objective.</p><p>I would not doubt that it goes away, too. Because we saw comments and such drop off on our actual Copyblogger profile, and I think part of that is because Authorship ended. </p><p>However, Author Rank itself &#8212; the concept that Google is trying to judge content based on who wrote it &#8212; is not dead.</p><p>And Danny Sullivan at Search Engine Land <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~searchengineland.com/google-authorship-dead-author-rank-202254" target="_blank">discusses the current state of Author Rank</a> in a good article we&#8217;ll provide in the show notes. </p><p>Because it&#8217;s still used in what&#8217;s known as in-depth articles, and of course, Google hasn&#8217;t told us this, but they have other ways of identifying author authority. </p><p><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/author-rank/" target="_blank">Brian asked the question</a> in an article he wrote: What if Author Rank never happens? </p><p>The answer is: It doesn&#8217;t matter <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/how-to-think-about-google/" target="_blank">as long as you&#8217;re still building authority and creating great content</a> &#8212; then you have nothing to fear. </p><p>It&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been teaching you for the last eight years. If you continue to do those things, you&#8217;re in good shape.</p><h3>Why we eliminated blog comments and our Facebook page</h3><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> One of the lessons that&#8217;s become a lot more clear to me this year is the idea that we&#8217;re all in business, right? </p><p>An online business, or in business to make money &#8212; but to make money while serving an audience.</p><p>That&#8217;s why I think it&#8217;s so important to understand this intersection of where you offer the most value to your audience, and then what drives profit in your business. </p><p>And this is going to be different for everyone, right? </p><p>Two decisions we made this year that created a lot of discussion were <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/removing-blog-comments/" target="_blank">removing blog comments</a> and <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/bye-facebook/" target="_blank">killing our Facebook page</a>.</p><p>Some people agreed, some people didn&#8217;t, and everyone&#8217;s entitled to their own opinion. </p><p>For us, it really came down to understanding where we provide the most value for our audience with limited resources. </p><p>We can&#8217;t be everywhere at all times and everything to all people, so where do we provide the most value? </p><p>In terms of our business, what actually drives revenue and profit? Understanding that intersection is what led to those decisions.</p><p>It&#8217;s what you have to understand and think about when you consider possibilities such as &#8220;should we go after Google+, or should we step back from Google+? What social networks are we going to invest in? What type of content are we going to invest in?&#8221;</p><p>It really is a lesson that is not specific to 2014, but understanding that intersection of where you&#8217;re providing value for your audience and where you derive the most business value really is a way to guide your decisions.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> That&#8217;s right.</p><h3>Is native advertising working?</h3><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Let&#8217;s move on to the next one. I know that you wanted to talk about native advertising.</p><p>As you reflect back on the big research project you did on native advertising, what are your thoughts?</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Native advertising has got to be the buzzword of the year, I think. Especially at the start of the year, it was huge. </p><p>Companies were coming out of the woodwork to support it, and the funny thing is: we did a series and survey about it, and not very many people actually knew what it is.</p><p>In fact, <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/native-advertising-2014/" target="_blank">our native advertising survey results</a> demonstrated nearly 50 percent of the respondents didn&#8217;t have a clue what native advertising is, and another 48 percent had a shaky understanding of what it is. </p><p>There were only about three percent that were very knowledgeable about it, and I guarantee those were people who have businesses that cropped up to serve native advertising. </p><p>For those who don&#8217;t know, native advertising is paid content that matches a publication&#8217;s editorial standards while meeting the audience&#8217;s expectations. </p><p>For example, if you go to BuzzFeed, you can see lots of examples of promoted content, native advertising. If you go there right now, you&#8217;ll see promoted content by PlayStation and Heinz. </p><p>Another thing, too, is native advertising is not new. It&#8217;s just new online. </p><p>Because <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/examples-of-native-ads/" target="_blank">David Ogilvy was doing native advertising</a> back when he did campaigns for Guinness beer, and we termed that an advertorial. </p><p>It looked like an article, a top 10 best-of list, but it was an ad for Guinness. It was to promote their beer. It had a clear call to action, which is basically that a Guinness guy eats oysters. </p><p>You eat oysters, and it&#8217;s best to wash them down with Guinness beer. Now we have the same thing online. </p><p>That&#8217;s the editorial side of native advertising. </p><p>There&#8217;s also the in-feed ad side of it: Twitter&#8217;s promoted posts, Facebook&#8217;s promoted stories. You&#8217;ll see in-stream ads inside apps, and Google text ads are also an idea that comes from native advertising.</p><p>It&#8217;s just advertising that is basically invading, coming into the editorial space, but it&#8217;s designed to look as if it was editorial, if it was an article.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Let me ask you: is it working? Does it work, and what opportunities does it provide, especially as we look forward into next year?</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question because here&#8217;s the thing: Native advertising has been a boon for publishers.</p><p>Many big, blue-chip media companies have come collapsing down because they can&#8217;t compete in the online world. </p><p>Well, here comes native advertising and publishers get to sell major real estate at a premium price.</p><p>Advertisers pay for this space, so this revenue model actually saves these businesses. </p><p>BuzzFeed is a great example. VICE is another example. For the time being, this revenue model is profitable. The question is, like you said, will it be profitable in the long run?</p><p>This is to be seen, because eventually the novelty will wear off. And in fact, the sponsored content&#8217;s native advertising does have a trust problem. </p><p><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~contently.com/strategist/2014/07/09/study-sponsored-content-has-a-trust-problem-2/" target="_blank">Contently ran a survey in 2014</a> and demonstrated that people look at, say, an advertorial in Entrepreneur magazine by Dell with a very skeptical eye. </p><p>And then <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/" target="_blank">ChartBeat</a>, a data analytics company, did a survey in early 2014. They said people simply are not scrolling on this content. </p><p>Either advertisers are going to wise up and say, &#8220;Native advertising isn&#8217;t working,&#8221; or they will create compelling content that will actually engage an audience, and maybe close that trust gap. </p><p>The opportunities are two-fold, I think. Brands are hiring a lot more writers to fill this gap because they see the value in native advertising, sponsored content, and promoted content. </p><p>We&#8217;ve seen a lot of journalists become content marketers. </p><p>But this could also be a revenue model for small-time publishers &#8212; actually allowing brands to come in and create content for their site as an ad. </p><p>But again, this is like what you mentioned earlier. You don&#8217;t want to put all of your eggs in one basket.</p><h3>The intersection of serving your audience and creating a profitable business</h3><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> And for some advertisers, native advertising isn&#8217;t going to be possible simply because of the budget. </p><p>Like you said, it&#8217;s a big opportunity for small-time publishers, but when you look at it from the content creator side, it&#8217;s not always going to be feasible. </p><p>That leads me into another lesson from 2014. There&#8217;s a lot of discussion about content shock &#8212; there&#8217;s all this content out there, so how do you rise above it? </p><p>You&#8217;ve got to create better content. That simply doesn&#8217;t change. The quality of your content, its usefulness to an audience, has to continue to get better. </p><p>That may mean thinking outside the box and finding new ways to reach people and new ways to maximize different mediums.</p><p>Most of our audience, as well as us at Copyblogger, don&#8217;t have unlimited resources or unlimited budgets, right?</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> If we&#8217;re going to invest more in our content, we&#8217;ve got to take time, effort, and resources away from something else. </p><p>You have to find a balance between content and technology. </p><p>If you can find ways to be more efficient with what you&#8217;re doing on the technology side, it will give you more resources on the content side. </p><p>And obviously for us, we released the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~newrainmaker.com" target="_blank">Rainmaker Platform</a> as the solution. The technical part of your business is taken care of on this one platform so that you can focus more on content.</p><p>I think as we look into 2015 that is going to continue to be so important, especially for publishers, advertisers, and companies who don&#8217;t have unlimited resources.</p><p>For most of us, we need to find ways to be more efficient with technology so that we can invest more time into creating better content and become more successful with our content marketing efforts. </p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> And I think to add to that, the idea of content shock is silly because we&#8217;ve always been under a deluge of content. There&#8217;s never been a shortage.</p><p>I can&#8217;t think of any time in my past that I&#8217;ve ever had a surplus of time to consume all the content that was out there. It&#8217;s always been a flood of content. </p><p>It&#8217;s really about content fatigue, right? Saying the same thing over and over. Rather than &#8220;efficient,&#8221; I think a better word is probably being &#8220;effective&#8221; with your content.</p><p>For example, instead of a daily publishing schedule, maybe you only publish twice a week so you have time to focus on creating and researching. </p><p>Because the thing is, you have to figure out a way to rise above the noise. If you can pour more of your resources on one piece of content, then you&#8217;re going to create something better than if you&#8217;re spreading resources out to create five pieces of content. </p><p>It&#8217;s also this idea of creating asset pillars, and I talked about this in a <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/asset-pillar-infographic/" target="_blank">blog post on infographics</a>. The infographic an as asset pillar reduces your content strategy time. </p><p>Say you wrote five different articles that are in your archives. You&#8217;d take those, create an infographic, and then you create a podcast from that infographic, like we did with the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/ingredients/" target="_blank">11 Essential Ingredients Every Blog Post Needs</a>. </p><p>It&#8217;s being smarter with what you have, especially for the small-time publishers. It allows you to pour more energy, focus, and creativity into one particular piece of content. </p><p>It gives you a fighting chance versus spreading yourself thin. </p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> That&#8217;s a great point. So one more topic, here, before we close out this episode, and that is empathy, which is one of the biggest buzzwords from 2014. </p><p>Anybody who attended our first Authority conference in Denver in May knows empathy was a big word. It really carried throughout the entire year. </p><p>Let&#8217;s close out by talking about empathy and then also how it influences that next-step idea of experience and journey maps.</p><h3>How empathy can influence the customer experience</h3><p><strong>Demian:</strong> <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/lede-empathy/" target="_blank">Empathy is this idea of relating to your customer</a>, being in their shoes, but then also wanting to provide a solution to their problem. </p><p>For example, I have empathy for freelancers, because I&#8217;ve been in their shoes and I understand them. I know where they&#8217;re at, and so I can speak to their plight. Their plight resonates with my plight. </p><p>Being able to do that is what we&#8217;re after. And so empathy is just another way of saying something that we&#8217;ve been saying for quite some time, which is about focus on the customer rather than upon ourselves. </p><p>We&#8217;re constantly fighting this from a commercial standpoint. You shift from &#8220;it&#8217;s all about me, the brand&#8221; to &#8220;it&#8217;s all really about the customer.&#8221;</p><p>In regard to empathy, what we&#8217;re trying to do is just relate to them. Google did this when they were promoting some of their products, like Chrome and gmail. </p><p>They did it through the <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vkVHijdQk" target="_blank">dad using Google products</a> to chronicle the birth of his daughter and document milestones as she grows up. That&#8217;s empathy, right? </p><p>Procter &#038; Gamble did a <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V-20Qe4M8Y" target="_blank">commercial for mothers who are raising Olympic athletes</a> that spoke to everything mothers do for their children.</p><p>It was a short commercial, but the idea was &#8220;we understand, we see what you do, so we want to create products that help you do your job better.&#8221; That&#8217;s empathy, too. </p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Our next episode of The Lede will tie what we learned in 2014 into what we&#8217;re going to focus on in 2015.</p><p>Empathy is really the first step toward being able to provide the most personalized experience to your users.</p><p>You have to understand what they&#8217;re thinking, what they&#8217;re feeling, and what they&#8217;re going through to really be able to tailor content that&#8217;s going to fit their needs at any given time.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Right.</p><h3>The next episode of The Lede: looking ahead to the evolution of content marketing in 2015</h3><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> I think one of the concepts that is starting to gain some traction that will gain even more traction in 2015 is adaptive content.</p><p>You can&#8217;t adapt content if you don&#8217;t understand who you&#8217;re adapting it for. And that&#8217;s why empathy is such an important building block and foundational principle.</p><p>We&#8217;re actually going to talk about that in our next episode. This episode was more about looking back to 2014. </p><p>Our next episode, which will be the final episode of The Lede in 2014, we will look ahead to 2015 and talk about some of the trends that we expect to see and how we individually, and as a company, are planning to capitalize on those.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Right. </p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Any final thoughts here, Mr. Farnworth, before we close?</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Yes. I was just going to say I have an article coming out on experience maps that will explain more of what we&#8217;re talking about here. </p><p>But it&#8217;s a natural progression from empathy to experience maps. An experience map is just a story of how your customer interacts with your product and your brand from start to finish. </p><p><a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/lede-journey-maps/" target="_blank">We talked about customer experience maps with Brian</a>, and as I did more research on it, it became clear that it&#8217;s a natural next step to what we&#8217;re calling adaptive content. </p><p>Because once you understand who your customer is and the interactions they have, and you see the high points and the low points, then you can create a better, a sublime customer experience from that experience map. </p><p>I suggest creating a prescriptive map, meaning looking forward. What is the most sublime, supreme customer experience you can create? </p><p>You can only do that by resonating, knowing your audience, knowing your customer, creating that experience map, and then creating that content, which then adapts to how they interact with your brand.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> In closing, Demian, I know we&#8217;re recording this podcast before Thanksgiving, but it&#8217;ll be released after. I just want you to know that I&#8217;m very thankful for you and for your contributions to The Lede.</p><p><strong>Demian</strong>: That&#8217;s very, very, very sweet of you. I need to find a tissue.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> (Chuckles) All right.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> I am very, very grateful for you too, Jerod. Honestly.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Yes. And you have a wonderful Thanksgiving in your new home, with your gal. Are you guys spending Thanksgiving in your new home?</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> No. We are actually doing the family thing this year, and then next year will be the first time that we bring everybody together in the house. </p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> Great. Right. Okay, good. All right, buddy.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> Yes. All right, man. Always a pleasure, and we&#8217;ll be back to wrap up the year in a couple weeks.</p><p><strong>Demian:</strong> I&#8217;ll be talking to you. Sounds good, man. Take care.</p><p><strong>Jerod:</strong> All right. Bye.</p><p>Thank you for listening to this episode of The Lede.

In the dark.</p><p>But because of the nature of attention, you too can become a skyscraper. <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/smart-podcast/" target="_blank">You too could rise out of the dark</a>.</p><p><span id="more-44289"></span>Might not be one of the Manhattan variety. But it&#8217;s attention, no less.</p><p>Be grateful.</p><p>The thing is <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/social-media-attention/" target="_blank">to not focus on the attention</a>. Focus on the work. The talent you&#8217;ve been given.</p><p>The best response to this talent is to develop it so that you become the best person with that talent. Don&#8217;t worry about the attention it breeds. Just develop the talent.</p><p>But that attention is NOT a fixed resource also means it is cheap.</p><p>A simple sleight-of-hand today can get you a million eyeballs tomorrow. Next day, darkness again.</p><p>Even earned attention is fickle. Those whom you thought loyal get bored, annoyed, or obsessed with something else. Don&#8217;t worry. Just focus on the talent, the work &#8230;</p><p>Because <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/bukowski-immortal-writing/" target="_blank">your work is a fixed asset</a>. Like land. And we all know that land naturally rises in value.</p><p>Your work <em>will not</em> naturally rise in value, though. It will only increase in value if you invest in your talent.</p><p>Remain faithful to that command and in time you will <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~www.copyblogger.com/content-star/" target="_blank">start to earn stock in attention</a>. Rise out of the dark. Like a skyscraper.</p><p>Keep in mind that you have no control over how much attention stock you can own. The only thing you have control over is developing your talent. </p><p>In the end, be grateful for anything you get. It could be gone tomorrow.</p><p>Happy Thanksgiving. </p><p>And let us know what you are thankful for <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://plus.google.com/b/112323449051656005687/+Copyblogger/posts/J3PBiBFyRbV" target="_blank">on Google+</a>.</p><p><em><small>Image by <a href="http://feeds.copyblogger.com/~/t/0/0/copyblogger/~https://unsplash.com/matthewwiebe" target="_blank">Matthew Wiebe</a> via Unsplash.</small></em></p><div class="author-box"><div><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/81c83444aed195de41d9e227bf13c2dc?s=100&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D100&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-100 photo' height='100' width='100' /> <span class="subheading">About the author</span><h3>Demian Farnworth</h3><br><p>Demian Farnworth is Copyblogger Media's Chief Copywriter.
